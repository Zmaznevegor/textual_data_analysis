PROSPECTUS SUMMARY The following summary is qualified in its entirety by detailed information appearing elsewhere in this prospectus ("Prospectus"). Each prospective investor is urged to read this Prospectus, and the attached Exhibits, in their entirety. DEPOSIT OF OFFERING PROCEEDS AND SECURITIES Rule 419 requires that the net offering proceeds, after deduction for underwriting compensation and offering costs, and all securities to be issued be deposited into an escrow or trust account (the "Deposited Funds" and "Deposited Securities," respectively) governed by an agreement which contains certain terms and provisions specified by the rule. Under Rule 419, the Deposited Funds and Deposited Securities will be released to the Company and to investors, respectively, only after the Company has met the following three conditions: First, the Company must execute an agreement for an acquisition(s) meeting certain prescribed criteria; second, the Company must successfully complete a reconfirmation offering which includes certain prescribed terms and conditions; and third, the acquisition(s) meeting the prescribed criteria must be consummated. The secondary sales of shares by Mr. Schramka will also be subject to the requirements of Rule 419. As such, the proceeds from these sales and the shares themselves must also be placed into escrow. POST-EFFECTIVE AMENDMENT Once the agreement(s) governing the acquisition(s) of a business(es) meeting the above criteria has (have) been executed, Rule 419 requires the Company to update the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part with a post-effective amendment. The post-effective amendment must contain information about: the proposed acquisition candidate(s) and its business(es), including audited financial statements; the results of this offering; and the use of the funds disbursed from the escrow account. The post-effective amendment must also include the terms of the reconfirmation offer mandated by Rule 419. The offer must include certain prescribed conditions which must be satisfied before the Deposited Funds and Deposited Securities can be released from escrow. RECONFIRMATION OFFERING The reconfirmation offer must commence within five business days after the effective date of the post-effective amendment. Pursuant to Rule 419, the terms of the reconfirmation offer must include the following conditions: (1) The prospectus contained in the post-effective amendment will be sent to each investor whose securities are held in the escrow account within five business days after the effective date of the post-effective amendment; 2) Each investor will have no fewer than 20, and no more than 45, business days from the effective date of the post-effective amendment to notify the Company in writing that the investor elects to remain an investor; 5 (3) If we do not receive written notification from any investor within 45 business days following the effective date, the pro rata portion of the Deposited Funds (and any related dividends) held in the escrow account on such investor's behalf will be returned to the investor within five business days by first class mail or other equally prompt means; (4) The acquisition(s) will be consummated only if investors having contributed 80% of the maximum offering proceeds elect to reconfirm their investments; and (5) If a consummated acquisition(s) has not occurred within 18 months from the date of this prospectus, the Deposited Funds held in the escrow account shall be returned to all investors on a pro rata basis within five business days by first class mail or other equally prompt means. RELEASE OF DEPOSITED SECURITIES AND DEPOSITED FUNDS The Deposited Funds and Deposited Securities may be released to us and the investors, respectively, after: (1) The Escrow Agent has received written certification from us and any other evidence acceptable by the Escrow Agent that the Company has executed an agreement for the acquisition(s) of a business(es) the value of which represents at least 80% of the maximum offering proceeds and has filed the required post-effective amendment, the post-effective amendment has been declared effective, the mandated reconfirmation offer having the conditions prescribed by Rule 419 has been completed, and the Company has satisfied all of the prescribed conditions of the reconfirmation offer; and (2) The acquisition(s) of the business(es) the value of which represents at least 80% of the maximum offering proceeds is (are) consummated. The Company plans to have the stock listed on the OTC. There is no guarantee of active or any trading market will develop. THE COMPANY Business Overview We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 26, 2010 to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operations to date. Other than issuing shares to its original shareholder, the Company never commenced any operational activities. Our auditor has expressed substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern. As of Nov. 15, 2010 the Company has $5,345 cash on hand. The Companys net loss for the audited period of October 26, 2010 (inception) to Nov. 15, 2010 was $(655). The Companys monthly burn rate in 2010 has been approximately $600 per month. The Company was formed by Stephen A. Schramka, the initial director, for the purpose of creating a corporation which could be used to consummate a merger or acquisition. Mr. Schramka serves as President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director. Mr. Schramka determined next to proceed with filing a Form S-1. Mr.Schramka, the President and Director, elected to commence implementation of our principal business purpose, described below under "Plan of Operation". As such, we can be defined as a "shell" company, whose sole purpose at this time is to locate and consummate a merger or acquisition with a private entity. The Company will utilize word of mouth to locate a merger or acquisition candidate. The Company must locate a merger or acquisition candidate within 18 months of the effectiveness of this registration or refund investors funds as described herein. It is anticipated that the most likely consideration for such merger or acquisition will be in common stock of the Company. The proposed business activities described herein classify us as a "blank check" company. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale securities of "blank check" companies in their prospective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in the Company's securities until such time as the Company has successfully implemented its business plan described herein. Accordingly, the current shareholder of the Company has executed and delivered a "lock-up" letter agreement, affirming that his/her respective shares of the Company's common stock until such time as the Company has successfully consummated a merger or acquisition and the Company is no longer classified as a "blank check" company. In order to provide further assurances that no trading will occur in the Company's securities until a merger or acquisition has been consummated, the current shareholder has agreed to place his/her respective certificates until such time as legal counsel has confirmed that a merger or acquisition has been successfully consummated. However, while we believe that the procedures established to preclude any sale of our securities prior to closing of a merger or acquisition will be sufficient, there can be no assurances that the procedures established herein will unequivocally limit any shareholder to sell their respective securities before such closing. 6 The maximum offering proceeds may not be sufficient capital to acquire an operating business thus the Company may require future stock sales and/or possible debt. As of the date of this prospectus, we have 10,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock issued and outstanding. Our operations and corporate offices are located at 2550 E. Desert Inn Road Ste. 224, Las Vegas, NV 89121, with a telephone number of (602) 460-6520. Our fiscal year end is September 30th. THE OFFERING We are offering, on a best efforts, self-underwritten basis, an offering of 6,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.005 per share . The proceeds from the sale of the shares in this offering will be payable to Abby Ertz, Esq., fbo Valer, Inc." and will be deposited in a non-interest bearing bank account until the escrow conditions are met and thus no interest shall be paid to any investor or to us. All subscription agreements and checks should be delivered to Abby Ertz, Esq., fbo Valer, Inc., at the address provided on the Subscription Agreement. Failure to do so will result in checks being returned to the investor who submitted the check. All subscription funds will be held in escrow pending the achievement of the Offering ($30,000) and no funds shall be released to us until such a time as the escrow conditions are met (see the section titled "Plan of Distribution" herein). The offering may terminate on the earlier of: (i) the date when the sale of all 1,200,000 shares is completed, , (ii) or 180 days from the effective date of this document, or any extension thereto. As such, the proceeds from these sales and the shares themselves must also be placed into escrow. Mr. Schramka will negotiate an acquisition on the basis of the best interests of the shareholders including himself. If the Minimum Offering ($6,000) is not achieved within 180 days of the date of this prospectus, all subscription funds will be returned to investors promptly without interest or deduction of fees unless the Company extends the offering period an additional 180 days. The Company will deliver stock certificates attributable to shares of common stock purchased directly to the purchasers within ninety (90) days of the close of the offering. We are conducting a "Blank Check" offering subject to Rule 419 of Regulation C as promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "S.E.C.") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").The net offering proceeds, after deduction for offering expenses, and the securities to be issued to investors must be deposited in an escrow account (the "Deposited Funds" and "Deposited Securities," respectively). While held in the escrow account, the deposited securities may not be traded or transferred. Except for an amount up to 10% of the deposited funds otherwise releasable under Rule 419, the deposited funds and the deposited securities may not be released until an acquisition meeting certain specified criteria has been consummated and a sufficient number of investors (80%) reconfirm their investment in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 419. Pursuant to these procedures, a new prospectus, which describes an acquisition candidate and its business and includes audited financial statements, will be delivered to all investors. We must return the pro rata portion of the deposited funds to any investor who does not elect to remain an investor. Unless a 80% of investors elect to remain investors, all investors will be entitled to the return of a pro rata portion of the deposited funds and none of the deposited securities will be issued to investors. In the event an acquisition is not consummated within 18 months of the effective date of this prospectus, the deposited funds will be returned on a pro rata basis to all investors. The offering price of the common stock has been determined arbitrarily and bears no relationship to any objective criterion of value. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, historical earnings or net worth. The purchase of the common stock in this offering involves a high degree of risk. The common stock offered in this prospectus is for investment purposes only and currently no market for our common stock exists. Please refer to the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Dilution" before making an investment in this stock. 7 SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION The following table sets forth summary financial data derived from our financial statements. The data should be read in conjunction with the financial statements, related notes and other financial information included in this prospectus.

Prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this prospectus, before making an investment decision concerning the common stock. SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR MAY HINDER OPERATIONS. Our operations depend solely on the efforts of Stephen A. Schramka, the sole officer and director of the Company. Mr. Schramka has no experience related to public company management, nor as a principal accounting officer. Because of this, we may be unable to offer and sell the shares in this offering, develop our business or manage our public reporting requirements. We cannot guarantee that it will be able overcome any such obstacles. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BUSINESS. Stephen A. Schramka is involved in other employment opportunities and may periodically face a conflict in selecting between us and other personal and professional interests. We have not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts should they occur. If we lose Stephen A. Schramka to other pursuits without a sufficient warning, we may, consequently, go out of business.. 8 RULE 419 LIMITATIONS MAY LIMIT BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.. Rule 419 generally requires that the securities to be issued and the funds received in a blank check offering be deposited and held in an escrow account until an acquisition meeting specified criteria is completed. Before the acquisition can be completed and before the funds and securities can be released, the issuer in a blank check offering is required to update its registration statement with a post-effective amendment. After the effective date of any such post-effective amendment, we are required to furnish investors with the prospectus produced thereby containing information, including audited financial statements, regarding the proposed acquisition candidate and its business. Investors must be given no fewer than 20 and no more than 45 business days from the effective date of the post-effective amendment to decide to remain investors or require the return of their investment funds. Any investor not making a decision within said period is automatically to receive a return of his investment funds. Although investors may request the return of their investment funds in connection with the reconfirmation offering required by Rule 419, the Company's shareholders will not be afforded an opportunity specifically to approve or disapprove any particular transaction involving the purchase of Shares from management. See Risk Factor entitled "Actual and Potential Conflicts of Interest." PROHIBITION TO SELL OR OFFER TO SELL SHARES IN ESCROW ACCOUNT MAY LIMIT LIQUIDITY. According to Rule 15g-8 as promulgated by the S.E.C. under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), it shall be unlawful for any person to sell or offer to sell Shares (or any interest in or related to the Shares) held in the Rule 419 escrow account other than pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order or by will or the laws of descent and distribution. As a result, contracts for sale to be satisfied by delivery of the Deposited Securities (e.g., contracts for sale on a when, as, and if issued basis) are prohibited. DISCRETIONARY USE OF PROCEEDS; "BLANK CHECK" OFFERING LEADS TO UNCERTAINTY AS TO FUTURE BUSINESS SUCCESS. As a result of management's broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of this offering, this offering can be characterized as a "blank check" offering. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering are intended generally to be applied toward effecting a Business Combination, such proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. Accordingly, prospective investors will invest in us without an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any one or more business combinations. There can be no assurance that determinations ultimately made by us relating to the specific allocation of the net proceeds of this offering will permit us to achieve its business objectives. See "Proposed Business." REGULATIONS CONCERNING "BLANK CHECK" ISSUERS MAY LIMIT BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. The ability to register or qualify for sale the Shares for both initial sale and secondary trading is limited because a number of states have enacted regulations pursuant to their securities or "blue sky" laws restricting or, in some instances, prohibiting, the sale of securities of "blank check" issuers, such as us, within that state. In addition, many states, while not specifically prohibiting or restricting "blank check" companies, may not register the Shares for sale in their states. Because of such regulations and other restrictions, our selling efforts, and any secondary market which may develop, may only be conducted in those jurisdictions where an applicable exemption is available or a blue sky application has been filed and accepted or where the Shares have been registered. NO OPERATING HISTORY OR REVENUE AND MINIMAL ASSETS RESULTS IN NO ASSURANCE OF SUCCESS. We have no operating history nor any revenues or earnings from operations. We have no significant assets or financial resources. We will, in all likelihood, sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until the consummation of a business combination. This may result in us incurring a net operating loss which will increase continuously until we can consummate a business combination with a profitable business opportunity. This may lessen the possibility of finding a suitable acquisition or merger candidate as such loss would be inherited on their financial statements. There is no assurance that we can identify such a business opportunity and consummate such a business combination. SPECULATIVE NATURE OF OUR PROPOSED OPERATIONS RESULTS IN NO ASSURANCE OF SUCCESS. The success of our proposed plan of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations, financial condition and management of the identified business opportunity. While we intends to seek business combinations with entities having established operating histories, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in locating candidates meeting such criteria. In the event we complete a business combination, of which there can be no assurance, the success of the our operations may be dependent upon management of the successor firm or venture partner firm and numerous other factors beyond our control. NO ACTIVE TRADING MARKET MAY MEAN THE SHARES ARE ILLIQUID. The Company plans to have the stock listed on the OTC. There is no guarantee of active or any trading market will develop. 9 SCARCITY OF AND COMPETITION FOR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND COMBINATIONS MAY LIMIT POSSIBLE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. We are and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies which may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all such entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we and, consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. Moreover, we will also compete in seeking merger or acquisition candidates with numerous other small public companies. There are relatively low barriers to entry and there is relative ease with which new competitors may enter the market as a blank check or shell company. NO AGREEMENT FOR BUSINESS COMBINATION OR OTHER TRANSACTION - NO STANDARDS FOR BUSINESS COMBINATION . We have no arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect to engaging in a merger with, joint venture with or acquisition of, a private entity. There can be no assurance we will be successful in identifying and evaluating suitable business opportunities or in concluding a business combination. We have not identified any particular industry or specific business within an industry for evaluations. We have been in the developmental stage since inception and have no operations to date. Other than issuing shares to our original shareholder, we never commenced any operational activities. Our search for acquisition or merger candidates is largely limited to word of mouth as any advertising could be deemed general solicitation therefore limiting the number of merger/acquisition candidates who may learn of our company. There is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate a business combination on terms favorable to us. We have not established a specific length of operating history or a specified level of earnings, assets, net worth or other criteria which it will require a target business opportunity to have achieved, and without which we would not consider a business combination in any form with such business opportunity. Accordingly, we may enter into a business combination with a business opportunity having no significant operating history, losses, limited or no potential for earnings, limited assets, negative net worth or other negative characteristics. CONTINUED MANAGEMENT CONTROL, LIMITED TIME AVAILABILITY MAY LIMIT BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. While seeking a business combination, Mr. Schramka anticipates devoting between 10 to 30 hours per month to our business. Our officer has not entered into written employment agreements with us and is not expected to do so in the foreseeable future. We have not obtained key man life insurance on our officer and director. Notwithstanding the combined limited experience and time commitment of our officer and director, loss of the services of any of these individuals would adversely affect our development of our business and its likelihood of continuing operations. See "MANAGEMENT." CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF BUSINESS. Our officer and director may in the future participate in other business ventures which compete directly with us. Additional conflicts of interest and non-arms length transactions may also arise in the future in the event our officer and directors is involved in the management of any firm with which we transact business. The Company's Board of Directors has adopted a resolution which prohibits us from completing a merger with, or acquisition of, any entity in which our management serve as officer, director or partner, or in which he or his family members own or hold any ownership interest. We are not aware of any circumstances under which this policy could be changed while current management is in control of the Company. Stephen A. Schramka our sole officer and director is as of the date of this prospectus no participating in any other blank check business ventures. The sole officer and director will have absolute control over all matters requiring stockholder approval. See "DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS" REPORTING REQUIREMENTS MAY DELAY OR PRECLUDE ACQUISITION. Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), requires companies subject thereto to provide certain information about significant acquisitions, including certified financial statements for the company acquired, covering one or two years, depending on the relative size of the acquisition. The time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target entities to prepare such statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable acquisition by the Company. Acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may not be appropriate for acquisition so long as the reporting requirements of the 1934 Act are applicable. ADDED COSTS OF BEING A PUBLIC COMPANY MAY DELAY OR PRECLUDE ACQUISITION. The Company will face the added costs of being a public company, including the costs associated with the disclosure and accounting controls that the company will be required to comply with under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As such this may limit acquisition possibilities or cause the company to cease business prior to the completion of any acquisition. OUR AUDITORS HAVE ISSUED A GOING CONCERN OPINION REFLECTING THAT WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY CONTINUING OPERATIONS. Because our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, there is substantial uncertainty we will continue operations in which case you could lose your investment. 10 Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next 12 months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might reduce the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment. We lack an operating history and have losses that we expect to continue into the future. There is no assurance our future operations will result in profitable revenues. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably, we will cease operations and you will lose your investment. OUR SHARES MAY BE CONSIDERED PENNY STOCKS WHICH WOULD LIMIT THEIR LIQUIDITY. Because the Securities and Exchange Commission imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokers who deal in our shares that are penny stocks, some brokers may be unwilling to trade them. This means that you may have difficulty reselling your shares and this may cause the price of the shares to decline. Our shares would be classified as penny stocks and are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokers/dealers who sell our securities in this offering or in the aftermarket. For sales of our securities, the broker or dealer must make a special suitability determination and receive from you a written agreement prior to making a sale for you. Because of the imposition of the foregoing additional sales practices, it is possible that brokers will not want to make a market in our shares. This could prevent you from reselling your shares and may cause the price of the shares to decline. LACK OF MARKET RESEARCH OR MARKETING ORGANIZATION MAY LIMIT BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. We have neither conducted, nor have others made available to it, results of market research indicating that market demand exists for the transactions contemplated by us. Moreover, we do not have, and do not plan to establish, a marketing organization. Even in the event demand is identified for a merger or acquisition contemplated by us, there is no assurance we will be successful in completing any such business combination. LACK OF DIVERSIFICATION MAY LIMIT FUTURE BUSINESS. Our proposed operations, even if successful, will in all likelihood result in the Company engaging in a business combination with only one business opportunity. Consequently, our activities will be limited to those engaged in by the business opportunity which we merge with or acquire. Our inability to diversify our activities into a number of areas may subject us to economic fluctuations within a particular business or industry and therefore increase the risks associated with the Company's operations. POSSIBLE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT REGULATION MAY INCREASE COSTS. Although we will be subject to regulation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, we believe will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, insofar as we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. In the event we engage in business combinations which result in our holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In such event, we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs. The Company has obtained no formal determination from the Securities and Exchange Commission as to our status under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and, consequently, any violation of such Act would subject us to material adverse consequences. PROBABLE CHANGE IN CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT MAY RESULT IN UNCERTAIN MANAGEMENT FUTURE. A business combination involving the issuance of our common stock will, in all likelihood, result in shareholders of a private company obtaining a controlling interest. Any such business combination may require our management to sell or transfer all or a portion of the common stock held by them, or resigns as members of the Board of Directors of the Company. The resulting change in control of could result in removal of our present officer and director, and a corresponding reduction in or elimination of his participation in our future affairs. REDUCTION OF PERCENTAGE SHARE OWNERSHIP FOLLOWING A BUSINESS COMBINATION MAY RESULT IN DILUTION. Our primary plan of operation is based upon a business combination with a private concern which, in all likelihood, would result in our issuing securities to shareholders of such private company. The issuance of previously authorized and unissued common stock would result in reduction in percentage of shares owned by our present and prospective shareholders and would most likely result in a change in control or management. 11 DISADVANTAGES OF BLANK CHECK OFFERING MAY DISCOURAGE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. We may enter into a business combination with an entity that desires to establish a public trading market for its shares. A business opportunity may attempt to avoid what it deems to be adverse consequences of undertaking its own public offering by seeking a business combination with us. Such consequences may include, but are not limited to, time delays of the registration process, significant expenses to be incurred in such an offering, loss of voting control to public shareholders and the inability or unwillingness to comply with various federal and state securities laws enacted for the protection of investors. These securities laws primarily relate to provisions regarding the registration of securities which require full disclosure of our business, management and financial statements. Any entity that enters into a business combination with us will be required to comply with the various federal and state securities laws, including laws and regulations relating to the registration of securities. In addition the blank check company may be required to meet reporting requirements for up to 18 months prior to the completion of an acquisition and investors will have no access to their shares or any method of liquidity until such acquisition and reconfirmation offering is completed. FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION OF BUSINESS COMBINATION MAY DISCOURAGE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. Federal and state tax consequences will, in all likelihood, be major considerations in any business combination we may undertake. Currently, such transactions may be structured so as to result in tax- free treatment to both companies, pursuant to various federal and state tax provisions. We intend to structure any business combination so as to minimize the federal and state tax consequences to both us and the target entity; however, there can be no assurance that such business combination will meet the statutory requirements of a tax-free reorganization or that the parties will obtain the intended tax-free treatment upon a transfer of stock or assets. A non-qualifying reorganization could result in the imposition of both federal and state taxes which may have an adverse effect on both parties to the transaction. REQUIREMENT OF AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAY DISQUALIFY BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. We believe that any potential business opportunity must provide audited financial statements for review, and for the protection of all parties to the business combination. One or more attractive business opportunities may choose to forego the possibility of a business combination with us, rather than incur the expenses associated with preparing audited financial statements. BLUE SKY CONSIDERATIONS MAY LIMIT SALES IN CERTAIN STATES. Because the securities registered hereunder have not been registered for resale under the blue sky laws of any state, and we have no current plans to register or qualify its shares in any state, the holders of such shares and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future, should be aware that there may be significant state blue sky restrictions upon new investors to purchase the securities which could reduce the size of the potential market. As a result of recent changes in federal law, non-issuer trading or resale of our securities is exempt from state registration or qualification requirements in most states. However, some states may continue to attempt to restrict the trading or resale of blind-pool or "blank-check" securities. Accordingly, investors should consider any potential secondary market for our securities to be a limited one. PURCHASES BY AFFILIATES Our officer, director, principal shareholder and his affiliates may purchase, for investment purposes, a portion of the Shares offered hereby, which could, upon conversion, increase the percentage of the Shares owned by such persons. The purchases by these control persons may make it possible for the Offering to meet the escrow amount. NO ASSURANCE SHARES WILL BE SOLD MAY LIMIT FUTURE OPERATING CAPITAL. The 6,000,000 Common Shares are to be offered directly by us, and no individual, firm, or corporation has agreed to purchase or take down any of the shares. No assurance can be given that any or all of the Shares will be sold in which case the company may be unable to develop its business plan. The company must sell $6,000 prior to closing its offering and 80% of investors must reconfirm their purchases as described herein. BUSINESS ANALYSIS BY NON PROFESSIONALS MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF POOR ANALYSIS. Analysis of business operations will be undertaken by our sole officer and director who is not a professional business analyst. Thus the depth of such analysis may not be as great as if undertaken by a professional which increases the risk that any merger or acquisition candidate may not continue successfully. ARBITRARY OFFERING PRICE MEANS SHARES MAY NOT REFLECT FAIR MARKET VALUE. The Offering Price of the Shares bears no relation to book value, assets, earnings, or any other objective criteria of value. They have been arbitrarily determined by us. There can be no assurance that, even if a public trading market develops for our securities, the Shares will attain market values commensurate with the Offering Price. 12 NO PUBLIC MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES MAY LIMIT THE LIQUIDITY OF SHARES. Prior to the Offering, there has been no public market for the Shares being offered. There can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop or that purchasers of the Shares will be able to resell their securities at prices equal to or greater than the respective initial public offering prices. The market price of the Shares may be affected significantly by factors such as announcements by us or our competitors, variations in our results of operations, and market conditions in the retail, electron commerce, and internet industries in general. Movements in prices of stock may also affect the market price in general. As a result of these factors, purchasers of the Shares offered hereby may not be able to liquidate an investment in the Shares readily or at all. SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE All of the 10,000,000 Shares, which are held by management, have been issued in reliance on the private placement exemption under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Act"). Such Shares will not be available for sale in the open market without separate registration except in reliance upon Rule 144 under the Act. In general, under Rule 144 a person (or persons whose shares are aggregated) who has beneficially owned shares acquired in a non-public transaction for at least one year, including persons who may be deemed Affiliates of the Company (as that term is defined under the Act) would be entitled to sell within any three- month period a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then outstanding shares of common stock, or the average weekly reported trading volume on all national securities exchanges and through NASDAQ during the four calendar weeks preceding such sale, provided that certain current public information is then available. If a substantial number of the Shares owned by management became eligible for sale in the future and were sold pursuant to Rule 144 or a registered offering, the market price of the Common Stock could be adversely affected. Holders of our common stock, including Mr. Schramka, may not rely on Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 and must register any re-sales of common stock under the Securities Act of 1933. Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This prospectus contains forward-looking statements about our business, financial condition and prospects that reflect our management's assumptions and beliefs based on information currently available. We can give no assurance that the expectations indicated by such forward-looking statements will be realized. If any of our assumptions should prove incorrect, or if any of the risks and uncertainties underlying such expectations should materialize, the actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. The key factors that are not within our control and that may have a direct bearing on operating results include, but are not limited to, acceptance of the proposed services that we expect to market, our ability to establish a substantial customer base, managements' ability to raise capital in the future, the retention of key employees and changes in the regulation of the industry in which we function. There may be other risks and circumstances that management may be unable to predict. When used in this document, words such as, "believes," "expects," "intends," "plans," "anticipates," "estimates" and similar expressions are intended to identify and qualify forward-looking statements, although there may be certain forward-looking statements not accompanied by such expressions. [Balance of this Page Intentionally Left Blank] 13 ITEM 4 - USE OF PROCEEDS Without realizing the offering proceeds, we will not be able to commence planned operations and implement our business plan. Please refer to the section, herein, titled "Management's Discussion and Plan of Operation" for further information. None of the proceeds from the sale of the Selling Shareholders shares will be delivered to the Company. The Company intends to use the proceeds from this offering as follows: Maximum Application Of Proceeds $ % of total % of net proceeds Total Offering Proceeds 30,000 100% 100% Escrow pending merger/acquisition Total Use of Proceeds 30,000 100% 100% The Company intends to use 100% of the proceeds from the offering to merge with, or acquire a business. The Company does not intend to use any of the proceeds to pay administrative and/or operating expenses, or for any other purpose. Expenses associated with merging with or acquiring a business include advertising, mailing and shipping for due diligence materials and possible travel. Abby Ertz, Esq., as escrow agent will receive a fee of $ ___________ for services as escrow agent. The escrow agent will be paid at the close of escrow. If the funds are not released to the registrant, the sole officer and director will pay the escrow costs. ITEM 5 - DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The offering price of the common stock has been arbitrarily determined and bears no relationship to any objective criterion of value. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, historical earnings or net worth. No valuation or appraisal has been prepared for our business. We cannot assure you that a public market for our securities will develop or continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price higher than the offering price. ITEM 6  DILUTION DILUTION "Dilution" represents the difference between the offering price of the shares of common stock and the net book value per share of common stock immediately after completion of the offering. "Net book value" is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities from total assets. In this offering, the level of dilution is increased as a result of the relatively low book value of our issued and outstanding stock. Assuming all shares offered herein are sold, giving effect to the receipt of the maximum estimated proceeds of this offering from shareholders net of the offering expenses, our net book value will be $11,000 or $0.0010 per share. Therefore, the purchasers of the common stock in this offering will incur an immediate and substantial dilution of approximately $0.004 per share while our present stockholders will receive an increase of $0.0005 per share in the net tangible book value of the shares they hold. This will result in a 80% dilution for purchasers of stock in this offering. None of the proceeds from the sale by the Selling Shareholder will be deliverable to the Company. The following table illustrates the dilution to the purchasers of the common stock in this offering: Maximum Offering Offering Price Per Share $0.005 Book Value Per Share Before the Offering $0.0005 Book Value Per Share After the Offering $0.001 Net Increase to Original Shareholder $0.0005 Decrease in Investment to New Shareholders $0.004 14 ITEM 7  SELLING SHAREHOLDER SELLING SHAREHOLDER No. Of Shares Percentage of Shares No. of Shares Percentage of Shares Name Before Offering Before Offering After Offering After Offering None None None None ITEM 8 - PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION There is no public market for our common stock. Our common stock is currently held by one shareholder. Therefore, the current and potential market for our common stock is limited and the liquidity of our shares may be severely limited. To date, we have made no effort to obtain listing or quotation of our securities on a national stock exchange or association. We have not identified or approached any broker/dealers with regard to assisting us to apply for such listing. We are unable to estimate when we expect to undertake this endeavor or that we will be successful. In the absence of listing, no market is available for investors in our common stock to sell their shares. We cannot guarantee that a meaningful trading market will develop or that we will be able to get our common stock listed for trading. If the stock ever becomes tradable, the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. As a result, investors may be unable to sell their shares at or greater than the price at which they are being offered. This offering will be conducted on a best-efforts basis utilizing the efforts of Stephen A. Schramka, our sole officer and director. Potential investors include, but are not limited to, family, friends and acquaintances of Stephen A. Schramka. The intended methods of communication include, without limitation, telephone and personal contact. In their endeavors to sell this offering, they will not use any mass advertising methods such as the internet or print media. Funds received by the sales agent in connection with sales of our securities will be transmitted immediately into a escrow account until the minimum sales threshold is reached. There can be no assurance that all, or any, of the shares will be sold. Stephen A. Schramka will not receive commissions for any sales originated on our behalf. We believe that he is exempt from registration as a broker under the provisions of Rule 3a4-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In particular, he: 1. Is not subject to a statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)39 of the Act, at the time of his or her participation; and 2. Is not to be compensated in connection with his participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities; and 3. Is not an associated person of a broker or dealer; and 4. Meets the conditions of the following: a. Primarily performs, or is intended primarily to perform at the end of the offering, substantial duties for or on behalf of the issuer otherwise than in connection with transactions in securities; and b. Was not a broker or dealer, or associated persons of a broker or dealer, within the preceding 12 months; and c. Did not participate in selling an offering of securities for any issuer more than once every 12 months other than in reliance on paragraphs within this section, except that for securities issued pursuant to rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, the 12 months shall begin with the last sale of any security included within one rule 415 registration. Stephen A. Schramka our sole officer or director of the Company may purchase any securities in this offering. There can be no assurance that all, or any, of the shares will be sold. As of this date, we have not entered into any agreements or arrangements for the sale of the shares with any broker/dealer or sales agent. However, if we were to enter into such arrangements, we will file a post effective amendment to disclose those arrangements because any broker/dealer participating in the offering would be acting as an underwriter and would have to be so named herein. 15 In order to comply with the applicable securities laws of certain states, the securities may not be offered or sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in such states or an exemption from such registration or qualification requirement is available and with which we have complied. The purchasers in this offering and in any subsequent trading market must be residents of such states where the shares have been registered or qualified for sale or an exemption from such registration or qualification requirement is available. As of this date, we have not identified the specific states where the offering will be sold. We will file a pre-effective amendment indicating which state(s) the securities are to be sold pursuant to this registration statement. We are conducting a "Blank Check" offering subject to Rule 419 of Regulation C as promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "S.E.C.") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").The net offering proceeds, after deduction for offering expenses and the securities to be issued to investors must be deposited in an escrow account (the "Deposited Funds" and "Deposited Securities," respectively). While held in the escrow account, the deposited securities may not be traded or transferred. Except for an amount up to 10% of the deposited funds otherwise releasable under Rule 419, the deposited funds and the deposited securities may not be released until an acquisition meeting certain specified criteria has been consummated and a sufficient number of investors reconfirm their investment in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 419. Pursuant to these procedures, a new prospectus, which describes an acquisition candidate and its business and includes audited financial statements, will be delivered to all investors. We must return the pro rata portion of the deposited funds to any investor who does not elect to remain an investor. Unless a sufficient number of investors elect to remain investors, all investors will be entitled to the return of a pro rata portion of the deposited funds and none of the deposited securities will be issued to investors. In the event an acquisition is not consummated within 18 months of the effective date of this prospectus, the deposited funds will be returned on a pro rata basis to all investors. The proceeds from the sale of the shares in this offering will be payable to Abby Ertz, Esq. fbo Valer, Inc. ("Escrow Account") and will be deposited in a non-interest bearing bank account at Bank of America until the escrow conditions are met. No interest will be paid to any shareholder or to us. All subscription agreements and checks are irrevocable. All subscription funds will be held in the Escrow Account pending achievement of the Offering and no funds shall be released to us until such a time as the escrow conditions are met. The escrow agent will continue to receive funds and perform additional disbursements until either the Offering is achieved or a period of 180 days from the effective date of this offering expires (or an additional 180 days if so extended by the us), whichever event first occurs. Thereafter, this escrow agreement shall terminate. If the Offering is not achieved within 180 days of the date of this prospectus (or an additional 180 days if so extended by the Company), all subscription funds will be returned to investors promptly without interest or deduction of fees. The fee of the Escrow Agent is $1,500. [See Exhibit 99(a)]. Investors can purchase common stock in this offering by completing a Subscription Agreement [attached hereto as Exhibit 99(b)] and sending it together with payment in full. All payments must be made in United States currency either by personal check, bank draft, or cashiers check. There is no minimum subscription requirement. All subscription agreements and checks are irrevocable. We expressly reserve the right to either accept or reject any subscription. Any subscription rejected will be returned to the subscriber within 5 business days of the rejection date. Furthermore, once a subscription agreement is accepted, it will be executed without reconfirmation to or from the subscriber. Once we accept a subscription, the subscriber cannot withdraw it. [Balance of this Page Intentionally Left Blank] 16 ITEM 9 - DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES TO BE REGISTERED COMMON STOCK We are authorized to issue 75,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value and no shares of preferred stock. We have issued 10,000,000 shares of common stock to date held by one (1) shareholder of record. The holders of our common stock: 1. Have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available therefore, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors; 2. Are entitled to share ratably in all of assets available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of corporate affairs; 3. Do not have preemptive, subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights; and 4. Are entitled to one vote per share on all matters on which stockholders may vote. The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker/dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange system). The penny stock rules require a broker/dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker/dealer also must provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker/dealer, and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from such rules, the broker/dealer must make a special written determination that a penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These heightened disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the number of broker/dealers willing to make a market in our shares, reducing the level of trading activity in any secondary market that may develop for our shares, and accordingly, customers in our securities may find it difficult to sell their securities, if at all. We have no current plans to either issue any preferred stock or adopt any series, preferences or other classification of preferred stock. The Board of Directors is authorized to (i) provide for the issuance of shares of the authorized preferred stock in series and (ii) by filing a certificate pursuant to the laws of Nevada, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, all without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Any shares of issued preferred stock would have priority over the common stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights. Any future issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the company without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction, or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders. In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock. Although the Board of Directors is required to make any determination to issue such stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of stockholders, the Board of Directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that potentially some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock. The Board of Directors does not at present intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock, unless otherwise required by law or stock exchange rules. PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS No holder of any shares of our stock has preemptive or preferential rights to acquire or subscribe for any unissued shares of any class of stock or any unauthorized securities convertible into or carrying any right, option or warrant to subscribe for or acquire shares of any class of stock not disclosed herein. 17 NON-CUMULATIVE VOTING Holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares, voting for the election of directors, can elect all of the directors to be elected, if they so choose, and, in such event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any directors. CASH DIVIDENDS As of the date of this prospectus, we have not paid any cash dividends to stockholders. The declaration of any future cash dividend will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon earnings, if any, capital requirements and our financial position, general economic conditions, and other pertinent conditions. We do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in business operations. REPORTS After this offering, we will make available to our shareholders annual financial reports certified by independent accountants, and may, at its discretion, furnish unaudited quarterly financial reports. ITEM 10 - INTEREST OF NAMED EXPERTS AND COUNSEL INTEREST OF NAMED EXPERTS AND COUNSEL Abby Ertz, Esq. is legal counsel to the Company. She has provided an opinion on the validity of the common stock to be issued pursuant to this Registration Statement. Ms. Ertz has also been retained as special counsel to our Company for purposes of facilitating our efforts in securing registration before the Commission and eventual listing on the OTCBB®. [Balance of this Page Intentionally Left Blank] 18 ITEM 11 - INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE REGISTRANT DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS We were incorporated on September 17, 2009 under the laws of the State of Nevada, to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. We have been in the developmental stage since inception and have no operations date. Other than issuing shares to its original shareholder, we never commenced any operational activities. We were formed for the purpose of creating a corporation which could be used to consummate a merger or acquisition. Mr. Schramka serves as President, Secretary, Treasurer and Sole Director. Mr. Schramka determined next to proceed with filing a Form S-1. Mr.Schramka, elected to commence implementation of our principal business purpose, described below under Plan of Operation". As such, we can be defined as a "shell" company, whose sole purpose at this time is to locate and consummate a merger or acquisition with a private entity. The Company will utilize word of mouth to locate a merger or acquisition candidate. The Company must locate a merger or acquisition candidate within 18 months of the effectiveness of this registration or refund investors funds as described herein. It is anticipated that the most likely consideration for such merger or acquisition will be in common stock of the Company. The proposed business activities described herein classify us as a "blank check" company. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of "blank check" companies in their respective jurisdictions. We do not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in the Company's securities until such time as the Company has successfully implemented its business plan described herein. Accordingly, the shareholder has executed and delivered a "lock-up" letter agreement, affirming that he/she will not sell his/her respective shares of our common stock until such time as we have successfully consummated a merger or acquisition and we are no longer classified as a "blank check" company. In order to provide further assurances that no trading will occur in our securities until a merger or acquisition has been consummated, the shareholder has agreed to place his respective stock certificate with our legal counsel, who will not release these respective certificates until such time as legal counsel has confirmed that a merger or acquisition has been successfully consummated. However, while we believe that the procedures established to preclude any sale of our securities prior to closing of a merger or acquisition will be sufficient, there can be no assurances that the procedures established herein will unequivocally limit any shareholder's ability to sell their respective securities before such closing. Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees We are currently in the development stage. During this development period, we plan to rely exclusively on the services of our sole officer and director who will devote between 10 to 30 hours a month to establish business operations and perform or supervise the minimal services required at this time. We believe that our operations are currently on a small scale and manageable by our sole officer and Director. There are no full or part-time employees. The responsibilities are mainly administrative at this time, as our operations are minimal. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY We use a corporate office located at 2550 E. Desert Inn Road Ste. 224, Las Vegas, Nevada 89121. Office space, utilities and storage are currently being provided free of charge. There are currently no proposed programs for the renovation, improvement or development of the facilities currently in use. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Stephen A. Schramka, our officer and director has not been convicted in a criminal proceeding. Stephen A. Schramka, our officer and director has not been permanently or temporarily enjoined, barred, suspended or otherwise limited from involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities. Stephen A. Schramka, our officer and director has not been convicted of violating any federal or state securities or commodities law. There are no known pending legal or administrative proceedings against the Company. No officer, director, significant employee or consultant has had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years prior to that time. 19 MARKET PRICE OF AND DIVIDENDS ON THE ISSUERS COMMON STOCK Market Price As of the date of this prospectus, there is no public market for our. common stock. This prospectus is a step toward creating a public market for our stock, which may enhance the liquidity of our shares. However, there can be no assurance that a meaningful trading market will develop. We make no representation about the present or future value of our common stock. As of the date of this prospectus, 1. There are no outstanding options or warrants to purchase, or other instruments convertible into our common equity. 2. There are currently 10,000,000 shares of our common stock held by our officer and director that are not eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act; 3. Other than the stock registered under this Registration Statement, there is no stock that has been proposed to be publicly offered resulting in dilution to current shareholder. All of the presently outstanding shares of common stock (10,000,000) are "restricted securities" as defined under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and may only be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from registration, if available. The SEC has adopted final rules amending Rule 144, which shall become effective on February 15, 2008. Pursuant to the new Rule 144, one year must elapse from the time a shell company, as defined in Rule 405, ceases to be a shell company and files Form 10 information with the SEC, before a restricted shareholder can resell their holdings in reliance on Rule 144. Form 10 information is equivalent to information that a company would be required to file if it were registering a class of securities on Form 10 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Under the amended Rule 144, restricted or unrestricted securities, that were initially issued by a reporting or non-reporting shell company or an Issuer that has at anytime previously a reporting or non-reporting shell company as defined in Rule 405, can only be resold in reliance on Rule 144 if the following conditions are met: (1) the issuer of the securities that was formerly a reporting or non-reporting shell company has ceased to be a shell company; (2) the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; (3) the issuer of the securities has filed all reports and material required to be filed under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding twelve months (or shorter period that the Issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports; and (4) at least one year has elapsed from the time the issuer filed the current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company. The Company plans to have the stock listed on the OTC. There is no guarantee of active or any trading market will develop. At the present time, the Company is classified as a shell company under Rule 405 of the Securities Act. As such, all restricted securities presently held by the founders of the Company may not be resold in reliance on Rule 144 until: (1) the Company files Form 10 information with the SEC when it ceases to be a shell company; (2) the Company has filed all reports as required by Section 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Act for twelve consecutive months; and (3) one year has elapsed from the time the Company files the current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company. HOLDERS As of the date of this prospectus, We have 10,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock issued and outstanding held by one shareholder of record. DIVIDENDS We have neither declared nor paid any cash dividends on either our preferred or common stock. For the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our preferred or common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent upon then existing conditions, including its financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, business prospects, and other factors that the Board of Directors considers relevant. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section must be read in conjunction with the Audited Financial Statements included in this prospectus. 20 PLAN OF OPERATION We intend to seek to acquire assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business which generates revenues, in exchange for our securities. We have no particular acquisitions in mind and have not entered into any negotiations regarding such an acquisition. Our sole officer, director, promoter nor any affiliates thereof have not engaged in any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger between us and such other company as of the date of this registration statement. While we will attempt to obtain audited financial statements of a target entity, there is no assurance that such audited financial statements will be available. We intend to obtain certain assurances of value of the target entity's assets prior to consummating such a transaction, with further assurances that an audited statement would be provided within seventy-five days after closing of such a transaction. Closing documents relative thereto will include representations that the value of the assets conveyed to or otherwise so transferred will not materially differ from the representations included in such closing documents. We have no full time employees. Mr. Schramka has agreed to allocate a portion of his time to our activities, without compensation. We anticipate that our plan can be implemented by our officer devoting approximately 10 to 30 hours per month to the business affairs and consequently, conflicts of interest may arise with respect to the limited time commitment by such officer. See "DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS" We are filing this registration statement on a voluntary basis because our primary attraction as a merger partner or acquisition vehicle will be its status as an SEC reporting company. Any business combination or transaction will likely result in a significant issuance of shares and substantial dilution to our present stockholders. Our Articles of Incorporation provides that we may indemnify our officers and/or directors for liabilities, which can include liabilities arising under the securities laws. Therefore, our assets could be used or attached to satisfy any liabilities subject to such indemnification. See "INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS." GENERAL BUSINESS PLAN Our purpose is to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of an Exchange Act registered corporation. We will not restrict our search to any specific business, industry, or geographical location and we may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature. This discussion of the proposed business is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities. We anticipate that we will be able to participate in only one potential business venture because we have nominal assets and limited financial resources. See "Financial Statements." This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk to shareholders because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another. We may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations, or which wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries. The primary method we will use to find potential merger or acquisition candidates will be word of mouth to locate companies which are looking to merge with a public shell. Mr. Schramka will negotiate an acquisition on the basis of the best interests of the shareholders including himself. Mr. Schramka will not sell any of his shares until after the completion of the primary offering. We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and extremely risky. Due to general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of a publicly registered corporation. Such perceived benefits may include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, providing liquidity (subject to restrictions of applicable statutes) for all shareholders and other factors. Business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. 21 We will continue to have, no capital with which to provide the owners of business opportunities with any significant cash or other assets. However, we believe that we will be able to offer owners of acquisition candidates the opportunity to acquire a controlling ownership interest in a publicly registered company without incurring the cost and time required to conduct an initial public offering. The owners of the business opportunities will, however, incur significant legal and accounting costs in connection with the acquisition of a business opportunity, including the costs of preparing Form 8-K's, 10-K's or 10-KSB's, agreements and related reports and documents. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "34 Act"), specifically requires that any merger or acquisition candidate comply with all applicable reporting requirements, which include providing audited financial statements to be included within the numerous filings relevant to complying with the 34 Act. Nevertheless, our officer and director has not conducted market research and are not aware of statistical data which would support the perceived benefits of a merger or acquisition transaction for the owners of a business opportunity. The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of our officer and director, who is not a professional business analyst. We intend to concentrate on identifying preliminary prospective business opportunities which may be brought to its attention through present associations of our officer, or by our shareholders. In analyzing prospective business opportunities, we will consider such matters as the available technical, financial and managerial resources; working capital and other financial requirements; history of operations, if any; prospects for the future; nature of present and expected competition; the quality and experience of management services which may be available and the depth of that management; the potential for further research, development, or exploration; specific risk factors not now foreseeable but which then may be anticipated to impact our proposed activities; the potential for growth or expansion; the potential for profit; the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products, services, or trades; name identification; and other relevant factors. We will meet personally with management and key personnel of the business opportunity as part of their investigation. To the extent possible, we intend to utilize written reports and personal investigation to evaluate the above factors. We will not acquire or merger with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. While not especially experienced in matters relating to the Acquired/Merged business, we will rely upon their own efforts and, to a much lesser extent, the efforts of our shareholders, in accomplishing the business purposes. It is not anticipated that any outside consultants or advisors, other than our legal counsel and accountants, will be utilized by us to effectuate our business purposes described herein. However, if we do retain such an outside consultant or advisor, any cash fee earned by such party will need to be paid by the prospective merger/acquisition candidate, as we have no cash assets with which to pay such obligation. There have been no discussions, understandings, contracts or agreements with any outside consultants and none are anticipated in the future. In the past, we have never used outside consultants or advisors in connection with a merger or acquisition. We will not restrict our search for any specific kind of firms, but may acquire a venture which is in its preliminary or development stage, which is already in operation, or in essentially any stage of its corporate life. It is impossible to predict at this time the status of any business in which we may become engaged, in that such business may need to seek additional capital, may desire to have its shares publicly traded, or may seek other perceived advantages which we may offer. However, we do not intend to obtain funds in one or more private placements to finance the operation of any acquired business opportunity until such time as we have successfully consummated such a merger or acquisition. We do not have any plans to conduct any offerings under Regulation S. ACQUISITION OF OPPORTUNITIES In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. It may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. On the consummation of a transaction, it is probable that the present management and shareholders will no longer be in control of our Company. In addition, our director may, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, resign and be replaced by new directors without a vote of our shareholders. It is anticipated that our principal shareholder may actively negotiate or otherwise consent to the purchase of a portion of their common stock as a condition to, or in connection with, a proposed merger or acquisition transaction. Any terms of sale of the shares presently held by our officer and director will be also afforded to all our other shareholders on similar terms and conditions. The policy set forth in the preceding sentence is based on an understanding of management, and we are not aware of any circumstances under which this policy would change while he is still our officer and director. Any and all such sales will only be made in compliance with the securities laws of the United States and any applicable state. 22 It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of its transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. If such registration occurs, of which there can be no assurance, it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after we have successfully consummated a merger or acquisition and we are no longer considered a "shell" company. Until such time as this occurs, we will not attempt to register any additional securities. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have a depressive effect on the value of our securities in the future, if such a market develops, of which there is no assurance. While the actual terms of a transaction to which we may be a party cannot be predicted, it may be expected that the parties to the business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the acquisition in a so-called "tax- free" reorganization under Sections 368a or 351 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). With respect to any merger or acquisition, a negotiation with target company management is expected to focus on the percentage of the Company which target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for all of their shareholdings in the target company. Depending upon, among other things, the target company's assets and liabilities, our shareholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in our company following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with substantial assets. Any merger or acquisition effected by us can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our then-shareholders. We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require some specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants, will set forth remedies on default and will include miscellaneous other terms. As stated herein above, we will not acquire or merge with any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. We are subject to all of the reporting requirements included in the 34 Act. Included in these requirements is our affirmative duty to file independent audited financial statements as part of our Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission upon consummation of a merger or acquisition, as well as our audited financial statements included in its annual report on Form 10-K (or 10-KSB, as applicable). If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to insure our compliance with the requirements of the 34 Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by the candidate to be acquired in the closing documents, the closing documents may provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of the present management of the Company. Our officer and shareholder has verbally agreed that he will advance any additional funds which may be needed for operating capital and for costs in connection with searching for or completing an acquisition or merger. These persons have also agreed that such advances will be made interest free without expectation of repayment unless the owners of the business which we acquire or merge with agree to repay all or a portion of such advances. There is no dollar cap on the amount of money which such persons will advance to us. We will not borrow any funds from anyone other than its current shareholder for the purpose of repaying advances made by the shareholder, and we will not borrow any funds to make any payments to the Company's promoters, management or their affiliates or associates. The Board of Directors has passed a resolution which prohibits us from completing an acquisition or merger with any entity in which our Officer, Director and principal shareholder or his affiliates or associates serve as officer or director or hold any ownership interest. We are not aware of any circumstances under which this policy, through their own initiative may be changed. The sole officer and director will have absolute control over all matters requiring stockholder approval. There are no arrangements, agreements or understandings between non-management individuals and us under which non-management can conduct the Company's affairs. COMPETITION We will remain an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns which have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than us. In view of our combined extremely limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared our competitors. 23 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

(A Development Stage Company) We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Valer, Inc. (the Company), as of November 15, 2010, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the period from the date of inception on October 26, 2010 to November 15, 2010 then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of November 15, 2010, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the period from the date of inception on October 26, 2010 to November 15, 2010 then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We were not engaged to examine management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of November 15, 2010, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion thereon. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, the Company has suffered losses and has experienced negative cash flows from operations, which raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to those matters are also described in Note B to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ Sam Kan & Company __________________________ Sam Kan & Company, January 26, 2011 Alameda, California F-3 Valer, Inc.

(A Development Stage Company) Notes To Financial Statements For the period from the date of inception on October 26, 2010 to November 15, 2010 NOTE A  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A summary of significant accounting policies of Valer, Inc. (the Company), a company organized in the state of Nevada (A Development Stage Company) is presented to assist in understanding the Companys financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. These financial statements and notes are representations of the Companys management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The Company has not realized revenues from its planned principal business purpose and is considered to be in its development state in accordance with ASC 915, Development Stage Entities, formerly known as SFAS 7, Accounting and Reporting by Development State Enterprises . Organization, Nature of Business and Trade Name The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 26, 2010. The companys administrative office is located at 2550 E. Desert Inn Road Ste. 224, Las Vegas, Nevada 89121 and its fiscal year end is November 15, 2010. The Companys principal business objective is to locate and consummate a merger or acquisition with a private entity and it can be classified as a blank check company. The company will utilize word of months to locate a merger or acquisition candidate. The company must locate a merger or acquisition candidate with 18 months of the effectiveness of this registration or refund investors funds. It is anticipated that the most likely consideration for such merger or acquisition will be in common stock of the company. As of November 15, 2010, the company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operation dates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market funds and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value. Due to the companys business nature, the net cash and cash equivalent will remain in an escrow accounts which is subject to release upon the earlier of written notification by the company of its completion of a merger or acquisition and reconfirmation offering confirmation or 18 months after the effective date of this registration. The Company had $5,345 in cash and cash equivalent as of November 15, 2010. Revenue and Cost Recognition The Company has no revenues to date from its operations. Once revenues are generated, management will establish a revenue recognition policy. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are carried at the expected net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management's assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivables. If there were a deterioration of a major customer's creditworthiness, or actual defaults were higher than historical experience, managements estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due to the Company could be overstated, which could have a negative impact on operations. Since the Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operations to date, there was no accounts receivable as of November 15, 2010. Incorporation Fee Incorporation Fees are generally expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying statement of operations for the inception period of October 26, 2010 to November 15, 2010. As of November 15 2010, there is a total of $525 incorporation fee incurred for the purpose of setting up the Company. Legal and Professional Fee Legal and Professional Fee is generally expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying statement of operations for the inception period of October 26, 2010 to November 15, 2010. As of November 15 2010, there is a total of $110 legal and professional fee incurred for the purpose of setting up the Company. F-8 Valer, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes To Financial Statements For the period from the date of inception on October 26, 2010 to November 15, 2010 NOTE A  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Stockholders Equity: Common and Preferred stock The Company's articles of incorporation provide for the authorization of seventy-five million (75,000,000) shares of common stock with par values of $0.001 and no shares of preferred stock. Common stock holders have all the rights and obligations that normally pertain to stockholders of Nevada corporations. As of November 15, 2010 the Company had 10,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The Company has not issued any shares of preferred stock. Basic Loss Per Share The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, Accounting for Earnings Per Share . Under the provisions of ASC 260, basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. Basic net loss per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding since inception. As of November 15, 2010 the Company had 10,000,000 common shares outstanding. As of November 15, 2010 and since inception, the Company had no dilutive potential common shares. The computations of basic loss per share of common stock are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of the financial statements. There are no common stock equivalents outstanding. Loss Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount From Inception on October 26, 2010 to Period Ended November 15, 2010 $ (655) 10,000,000 $ (0.00) Income Taxes The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes , which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax liabilities and assets as of November 15, 2010 are as follows: Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss $ 525 Income tax rate 34 % 178 Less valuation allowance (178 ) $ - Through November 15, 2010, a valuation allowance has been recorded to offset the deferred tax assets, including those related to the net operating losses. During the period ended November 15, 2010, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that it would not realize its deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance was recorded. At November 15, 2010, the Company had approximately $525 of federal and state net operating losses. The net operating loss carry forwards, if not utilized will begin to expire in 2027. F-9 Valer, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes To Financial Statements For the period from the date of inception on October 26, 2010 to November 15, 2010 NOTE A  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes (Continued) Reconciliations of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the actual tax rate follows for the period ended November 15, 2010 is as follows: U.S. federal statutory income tax rate 34 % State tax - net of federal benefit 0 % 34 % Increase in valuation allowance (34 %) Effective tax 0 % Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company is subject to uncertainty of future events, economic, environmental and political factors and changes in the Company's business environment; therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates. Accordingly, accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company's financial statements will change as new events occur and that more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company's operating environment changes. Changes are made in estimates as circumstances warrant. Such changes in estimates and refinement of estimation methodologies are reflected in the statements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The financial accounting regulation, ASC 825-10-50, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments , requires the determination of fair value of the Companys financial assets and liabilities. The estimated fair values of financial instruments were determined by management using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and advance from shareholder approximate their fair value because of their short maturities. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2010, the FASB issued guidance to remove the requirement for an entity that files financial statements with the SEC to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated. The adoption of this guidance during our current fiscal quarter did not have any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. On July 1, 2009, Financial Accounting Standards Board ( “ FASB ” ) Accounting Standards Codification ™ ( “ ASC ” ) became the sole source of authoritative Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( “ GAAP ” ) literature recognized by the Financial Accounting Standards Board for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. Rules and interpretive releases of the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. Except for applicable SEC rules and regulations and a limited number of grandfathered standards, all other sources of GAAP for nongovernmental entities were superseded by the issuance of ASC. ASC did not change GAAP, but rather combined the sources of GAAP and the framework for selecting among those sources into a single source. Accordingly, the adoption of ASC had no impact on the financial results of the Company. In June 2009, the FASB issued FAS 168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which now resided with ASC 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. ASC 105 will become the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. On the effective date of this Statement, the Codification will supersede all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other non-grandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification will become non-authoritative. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009.The Company does not expect the adoption of ASC 105 to have an impact on the Companys results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. F-10 Valer, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes To Financial Statements For the period from the date of inception on October 26, 2010 to November 15, 2010 NOTE A  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements (Continued) In June 2009, the FASB issued FAS 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), which now resides with ASC 810, Consolidation. ASC 810 is intended to (1) address the effects on certain provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities , as a result of the elimination of the qualifying special-purpose entity concept in ASC 860, and (2) constituent concerns about the application of certain key provisions of Interpretation 46(R), including those in which the accounting and disclosures under the Interpretation do not always provided timely and useful information about an enterprises involvement in a variable interest entity. This statement must be applied as of the beginning of each reporting entitys first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASC 810 to have an impact on the Companys results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In June 2009, the FASB issued FAS 140/166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of FAS 140, which now resides with ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing. ASC 860 is intended to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets: the effects of a transfer on its financial position, financial performance , and cash flows: and a transferors continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets. This statement must be applied as of the beginning of each reporting entitys first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASC 860 to have an impact on the Companys results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In May 2009, the FASB issued FAS 165, Subsequent Events, which now resides with ASC 855, Subsequent Events. This pronouncement establishes standards for accounting for and disclosing subsequent events (events which occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued). ASC 855 requires and entity to disclose the date subsequent events were evaluated and whether that evaluation took place on the date financial statements were issued or were available to be issued. It is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of ASC 855 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operation. Long-lived Assets-Technology The Companys technology is recorded at its cost. The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. As of November 15, 2010, the Company did not have any long-lived assets. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company maintains any long-lived assets. Concentration of Risk A significant amount of the Companys assets and resources are dependent on the financial support of the shareholders, should the shareholders determine to no longer finance the operations of the company, it may be unlikely for the company to continue. Property and Equipment As of November 15, 2010 the Company does not own any property and/or equipment. The Company currently is using one of the shareholders primary residences as office space. The company does not pay rent for the use of the space. Property and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period. F-11 Valer, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes To Financial Statements For the period from the date of inception on October 26, 2010 to November 15, 2010 NOTE A  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Property and Equipment (Continued) Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are: Estimated Useful Lives Office Equipment 5-10 years Copier 5-7 years Vehicles 5-10 years For federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For audit purposes, depreciation is computed under the straight-line method. The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operation to date. The Company currently does not have any property and equipment. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company maintains property and equipment. NOTE B  GOING CONCERN The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has a negative current ratio and Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of $655 for the period from inception to November 15, 2010. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of its planned business. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement and public offering of its common stock. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Companys existing stockholders. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. NOTE C  INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method; under which deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effect of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Deferred taxes will be provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effect of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. F-12 Valer, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes To Financial Statements For the period from the date of inception on October 26, 2010 to November 15, 2010 NOTE C  INCOME TAXES (Continued) Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasts and future events and operating results, the Company has provided for a valuation allowance in an amount equal to gross deferred tax assets resulting in no net deferred tax assets or liabilities for the periods audited. NOTE D  COMMON STOCK The Company's articles of incorporation provide for the authorization of seventy-five million (75,000,000) shares of common stock with par values of $0.001 and no shares of preferred stock. Common stock holders have all the rights and obligations that normally pertain to stockholders of Nevada corporations. As of November 15, 2010 the Company had 10,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The Company has not issued any shares of preferred stock. On October 26, 2010 the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.0006 to Stephen A. Schramka, the Companys director and shareholder in exchange for $6,000 in cash. Since each share has a par value of $0.001, a discount of $4,000 was applied to paid-in capital. NOTE E  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The issuance of common stock to Stephen A. Schramka was a related party transaction due to the fact that Stephen A. Schramka is the President/Secretary/Treasurer/Director of the company. Stephen A. Schramka is the companys sole officer and director, and the company currently operating out of the premises of Mr. Schramka, the officer and director of the Company, on a rent-free basis for administrative purposes. There is no written agreement or other material terms or arrangements relating to said arrangement. The company does not currently have any conflicts of interest by or among its current officer, director, key employee or advisors. The company has not yet formulated a policy for handling conflicts of interest, however, the company intends to do so upon completion of this offering and, in any event, prior to hiring any additional employees. NOTE F  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (CHANGE OF DIRECTOR) Management has reviewed material subsequent events in accordance with FASB ASC 855 Subsequent Events. As of November 26, 2010, Netta Girard has resigned the four positions including President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director and Stephen A. Schramka has been elected as President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director to serve until the next regularly scheduled meeting of shareholders. NOTE G  STOCK OPTION PLAN AND OTHER LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN The company currently does not have existing or proposed option plan. NOTE H  EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND OFFICERS COMPENSATION Since the incorporation on October 26, 2010, the company does not pay any compensation to any officer, director or employee, and does not have any employment agreements. Any future compensation to be paid will be determined by the Board of Directors, and, as appropriate, an employment agreement will be executed. The company does not currently have plans to pay any compensation until such time as it maintains a positive cash flow. F-13 PART II: INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS ITEM 13 - OTHER EXPENSES OF ISSUANCE AND DISTRIBUTION The following table sets forth the costs and expenses payable by VALER in connection with the sale of the common stock being registered.

VALER indemnifies any director, officer, employee or agent who is successful on the merits or otherwise in defense on any action or suit. Such indemnification shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, expenses, including attorney's fees actually or reasonably incurred by him. Nevada law also provides for discretionary indemnification for each person who serves as or at our request as an officer or director. We may indemnify such individual against all costs, expenses and liabilities incurred in a threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding brought because such individual is a director or officer. Such individual must have conducted himself in good faith and reasonably believed that his conduct was in, or not opposed to, our best interests. In a criminal action, he must not have had a reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. NEVADA LAW Pursuant to the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes 78.751, we shall indemnify any director, officer and employee as follows: Every director, officer, or employee of Valer, Inc. shall be indemnified by us against all expenses and liabilities, including counsel fees, reasonably incurred by or imposed upon him/her in connection with any proceeding to which he/she may be made a party, or in which he/she may become involved, by reason of being or having been our director, officer, employee or agent. or is or was serving at our request as our director, officer, employee or agent, partnership, joint venture, trust or enterprise, or any settlement thereof, whether or not he/she is a director, officer, employee or agent at the time such expenses are incurred, except in such cases wherein the director, officer, employee or agent is adjudged guilty of willful misfeasance or malfeasance in the performance of his/her duties; provided that in the event of a settlement the indemnification herein shall apply only when the Board of Directors approves such settlement and reimbursement as being for our best interests.

ITEM 15 - RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES During the past three years, we have issued the following unregistered securities in private transactions without registering the securities under the Securities Act: On October 27, 2010, Stephen A. Schramka, our officer and director, paid for expenses involved with the incorporation of the Company with personal funds on behalf of the Company and provided services, in exchange for 10,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company, each, par value $0.001 per share. At the time of the issuance, Stephen A. Schramka was in possession of all available material information about us, as he is the only officer and director. On the basis of these facts, Valer, Inc. claims that the issuance of stock to its founding shareholder qualifies for the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. We believe that the exemption from registration for these sales under Section 4(2) was available because: · Stephen A. Schramka is our executive officer and thus had fair access to all material information about us before investing; · There was no general advertising or solicitation; and · The shares bear a restrictive transfer legend. II-1 · All shares issued to Stephen A. Schramka. II-2 · The price of the common stock issued to Stephen A. Schramka was arbitrarily determined and bore no relationship to any objective criterion of value. At the time of issuance, we were recently formed or in the process of being formed and possessed no assets.

II-3 2. That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. 3. To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. 4. That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser: i.

Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. 5. That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: i.

Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. a.
