EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY STATUS We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies," including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and equity holder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, the trading market for our securities may be reduced, and the prices of our securities may be traded at lower prices and experience greater volatility. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an "emerging growth company" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an "emerging growth company" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period, for as long as it is available. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (2) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to "emerging growth company" have the meaning provided in the JOBS Act. ii Table of Contents SUMMARY This summary highlights information included elsewhere in this prospectus and does not contain all of the information you should consider in making an investment decision. You should read this entire prospectus carefully, including the sections entitled "Risk Factors," "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," "Selected Consolidated Financial Data," "Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus before making an investment decision regarding our securities. For all historical periods described, we have reported our financial condition and results of operations and other financial data as of and for the periods shown herein. The historical financial information presented may not be indicative of our future operating results or financial condition as a standalone public company. About Our Company Our Company We are a provider of alternative financial services to unbanked and under-banked consumers. We were formed in 2018 and continued, without interruption, the operations of Community Choice Financial Inc. (which we refer to as our "Predecessor") after the Restructuring (as described below). We provide our customers a variety of financial products and services, including short-term and medium-term consumer loans, check cashing, prepaid debit cards, and other services that address the specific needs of our customers. Through our customer focused business model, we provide our customers with access to financial services through our retail locations and our websites. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 471 retail locations across 12 states and were licensed to deliver similar financial services over the internet in 29 states. The 2018 Restructuring During the year ended December 31, 2017, our Predecessor experienced a net loss of $180.9 million, which when combined with a substantial amount of indebtedness caused our Predecessor to struggle with paying its debts as they came due. As a result, our Predecessor's independent registered public accounting firm included a paragraph in its audit opinion for the year ended December 31, 2017 casting doubt on our Predecessor's ability to continue as a going concern. During 2018, our Predecessor agreed with certain of its creditors to engage in a deleveraging transaction, which resulted in the Restructuring as described further below. On December 12, 2018, our Predecessor entered into an agreement (the "Restructuring Agreement"), with (a) CCF OpCo LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("CCF OpCo"), (b) CCF Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Company"), (c) CCF Intermediate Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("CCF Intermediate"), (d) certain of Predecessor's direct and indirect subsidiaries, (e) certain noteholders under (i) the Indenture, dated as of April 29, 2011 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the "2019 Indenture"), by and among the Predecessor, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. and Computershare Trust Company of Canada, together as indenture trustee (the "Indenture Trustee"), and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as collateral agent (in such capacity, the "Collateral Agent") governing Predecessor's 10.75% senior secured notes due May 1, 2019 (the "2019 Notes"), (ii) the Indenture, dated as of July 6, 2012 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the "2020 Indenture", and together with the 2019 Indenture, the "Existing Indentures"), by and among Predecessor, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, the Indenture Trustee and the Collateral Agent, governing Predecessor's 12.75% senior secured notes due May 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"), and (iii) the Indenture, dated as of September 6, 2018 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, 1 Table of Contents the "SPV Indenture"), by and among Community Choice Financial Issuer, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("CCF Issuer"), the guarantor party thereto, and Computershare Trust Company, N.A, as indenture trustee (in such capacity, the "SPV Trustee") and collateral agent (in such capacity, the "SPV Collateral Agent") governing CCF Issuer's 9.00% senior secured notes due September 6, 2020 (the "Secured Notes"), (f) certain investment funds associated with Diamond Castle Holdings and Golden Gate Capital (each, a "Sponsor," and collectively, the "Sponsors") and (g) CCF Issuer as revolving lender (the "Revolving Lender") under the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 6, 2018 (as amended, amended and restated, modified, supplemented, or otherwise restated from time to time, the "Revolving Credit Agreement"), by and among CCF OpCo, CCF Intermediate, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, GLAS Trust Company LLC as administrative agent, and the Revolving Lender. Substantially concurrent with the execution and delivery of, and pursuant to, the Restructuring Agreement, on December 12, 2018 (the "Closing Date") our Predecessor consummated a number of transactions contemplated thereby (the "Restructuring"), which satisfied Predecessor's obligation to execute a Deleveraging Transaction (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) as required under our Predecessor's credit facility with Victory Park Management, LLC (the "Victory Park Revolver") and the SPV Indenture. The Deleveraging Transaction was effected by way of an out-of-court strict foreclosure transaction, pursuant to which the Collateral Agent under the Existing Indentures, acting at the direction of certain beneficial holders holding more than 50% of the 2019 Notes and the beneficial holders of 100% of the 2020 Notes, exercised remedies whereby all right, title and interest in and to all of the assets of the Company that constitute collateral with respect to the Existing Indentures, including the issued and outstanding equity interests in certain of the Company's direct subsidiaries, were transferred to CCF OpCo. CCF OpCo is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the strict foreclosure, all obligations represented by the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes were extinguished, and holders of the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes received a pro rata share of $276.9 million of the newly-issued 10.750% Senior PIK Notes due 2023 (the "PIK Notes") and 850,000 Class A Common Units issued by the Company. Additionally, the holders of Secured Notes received their pro rata share of 150,000 Class B Common Units issued by the Company, and Predecessor's existing equity holders, including the Sponsors, are entitled to receive a pro rata share of up to 52,631.6 of the Company's Class C common units of limited liability company interest ("Class C Common Units"). Furthermore, we may in the future issue Class M common units of limited liability company interest ("Class M Common Units" and together with Class A Common Units, Class B Common Units and Class C Common Units, the "Common Units") pursuant to an equity incentive plan. In connection with the Restructuring, the SPV Indenture was amended and restated to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the Secured Notes from September 6, 2020 to June 15, 2023. See "Description of Other Indebtedness." The Class A Common Units and Class B Common Units (which Class B Common Units represented 15.0% of the aggregate number of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Units on December 12, 2018, subject to adjustment for any future issuances of common units (i) in consideration for the redemption of the PIK Notes ("Redemption Units"), or (ii) in connection with the issuance of any additional debt securities ("Additional Financing Units"), such that they continue to represent 15.0% of the issued and outstanding Common Units (including such Redemption Units and Additional Financing Units, but subject to dilution from any new management equity plan)) will entitle the holders thereof to voting rights (in each case, subject to the limitations in the governing documents of the Company). Following the Class C Distribution Trigger Time (as defined under "Description of Equity Securities"), Class C Common Units will be entitled to up to 5.0% of distributions from the Company. The Class C Common Units shall be subject to dilution from any new management equity 2 Table of Contents plan and other common units and other equity interests of the Company that may be issued after the effective date of the Deleveraging Transaction. See "Description of Equity Securities." In addition, in connection with the Restructuring, CCFI Funding II LLC, a non-guarantor subsidiary of CCF OpCo, entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of April 25, 2017 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the "Ivy Credit Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, our borrowings under the Ivy Credit Agreement were increased from $63,500 to $70,000. Summary Risk Factors Investing in any of the PIK Notes, the Class A Common Units or the Class B Common Units involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors are urged to carefully consider the matters discussed under "Risk Factors" prior to making an investment in our securities. Such risks include but are not limited to:  Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to meet our debt or other contractual obligations, or to raise additional capital to fund our operations, and could also limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and expose us to substantial increased expenses.  Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness. This could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.  The PIK Notes are effectively subordinated to our secured debt and any liabilities of our subsidiaries.  The PIK Notes are our obligations only and our operations are conducted through, and substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by, our subsidiaries.  Covenants in our debt agreements restrict our business in many ways and a default and acceleration under certain of those agreements could result in the lenders seizing all collateral granted to them as security for the loans.  Our reliance on specialty or other financing may be a risk if such financing sources become unavailable or their cost materially increases.  Changes in credit ratings issued by statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our costs of financing.  Repayment of our debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.  A change in the control of the Company could require us to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to do so.  We may enter into transactions that would not constitute a change of control that could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.  Qualified Noteholders and Former Qualified Noteholders, as applicable, will have significant approval rights and their interests may conflict with the interests of our other investors.  Prior to the Class B Conversion Event holders of Class A Common Units will have no voting rights.  We are not required to, and likely will not, satisfy our obligations under the PIK Notes with cash.  Holders of Class A Common Units will likely experience substantial dilution. 3 Table of Contents  Our ability to issue equity securities to finance future operations is limited and subject to the rights of certain investors.  We do not expect that an active trading market will develop for our Common Units or PIK Notes.  Holders of PIK Notes will not be entitled to any rights with respect to our Class A Common Units, but they will be subject to all changes made with respect to them to the extent we issue Class A Common Units in redemption of the PIK Notes.  We are subject to regulation at both the state and federal levels that is susceptible to varying interpretations, and our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in significant liability to us as well as significant additional costs to bring our business practices into compliance.  The CFPB has adopted rules applicable to our loans that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, on our ability to offer short-term consumer loans, on our ability to obtain ACH payment authorizations, and on our credit facility. If the CFPB Rule is not substantially modified before the compliance date in August of 2019, the continuance of our current business would be materially less profitable, impractical or impossible and we would most likely become unable to meet our debt obligations. In addition, both the CFPB and state officials are authorized to bring enforcement actions against companies that violate federal consumer financial laws which could result in significant liability to us as well as significant additional costs to bring our business practices into compliance.  In addition to the CFPB Rule released in October of 2017, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to conduct supervisory examinations and to adopt other rules that could potentially have a serious impact on our ability to offer short-term consumer loans. The Dodd-Frank Act also empowers the CFPB and state officials to bring enforcement actions against companies that violate federal consumer financial laws.  Changes in applicable laws and regulations, including adoption of new laws and regulations, and varying regulatory interpretations governing consumer protection, lending practices and other aspects of our business could have a significant adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or ability to meet our obligations, or make the continuance of our current business impractical, unprofitable or impossible.  Certain financial institutions have discontinued and other financial institutions may in the future discontinue or decline to provide financial services to us because of regulatory pressure.  Short-term consumer lending, including payday lending, is highly controversial and has been criticized as being predatory by certain advocacy groups, legislators, regulators, media organizations and other parties.  Customer complaints or negative public perception of our business could result in a decline in our customer growth and our business could suffer.  Some of our (and our competitors') lending practices in certain states have become or may become the subject of regulatory scrutiny and/or litigation. An unfavorable outcome in ongoing or future litigation or regulatory proceedings could force us to discontinue these business practices and/or make monetary payments. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 4 Table of Contents Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company We qualify as an "emerging growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, among other things:  we are exempt from the requirement to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;  we are permitted to provide less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; and  we are not required to give our stockholders non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. We may take advantage of these provisions until December 31, 2024 or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1 billion in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of common equity held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period. We have elected to take advantage of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards under Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act.

PIK Notes Offered $276.9 million aggregate principal amount of 10.750% Senior PIK Notes due 2023 (the "PIK Notes") plus an additional $194.4 million of PIK Notes issuable as in-kind interest payments. See "Description of PIK Notes" for more information. Maturity December 15, 2023 Interest Interest on the PIK Notes accrues at the rate of 10.750% per annum and is payable by increasing the principal amount of a PIK Note or by issuing additional Notes in a principal amount equal to such interest ("PIK Interest"). PIK Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 to the Holders of PIK Notes of record on the immediately preceding June 1 and December 1. Interest on the PIK Notes accrues from the most recent date to which interest has been paid. Interest on the PIK Notes is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. See "Description of PIK NotesPrincipal, Maturity and Interest." Ranking The PIK Notes rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the PIK Notes; equal in right of payment to any of our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and our Secured Notes) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries, including our subsidiaries' obligations, whether as borrower or guarantor, under the Ivy Credit Agreement, our revolving credit facility, the Secured Notes and trade payables.

Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control If a Change of Control (as defined under "Description of PIK Notes") occurs, unless, prior to the time we are required to make a Change of Control Offer (as defined under "Description of PIK Notes"), we have previously mailed or concurrently mail a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding PIK Notes as described under "Description of PIK NotesSelection and Notice," we will make an offer to purchase all of the PIK Notes pursuant to the offer described below at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the right of holders of the PIK Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

You should consider carefully the following risks, together with all the other information in this prospectus, including the financial statements and notes thereto, before you invest in our Securities. If any of the following risks actually materializes, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our Securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Relating to our Capital Structure Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to meet our debt or other contractual obligations, or to raise additional capital to fund our operations, and could also limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and expose us to substantial increased expenses. We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, our outstanding aggregate principal amount of indebtedness was $390.8 million, including amounts outstanding under the PIK Notes, the Secured Notes and borrowings under the Ivy Credit Agreement. For more information about our outstanding indebtedness, see Note 6 to the accompanying audited financial statements. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:  make it more difficult or impossible for us to satisfy our debt or contractual obligations with respect to our senior notes, including our ability to make interest and principal payments, our other indebtedness, and our other financial obligations;  subject holders of our debt to the risk of loss of a substantial portion of their investment and subject us to substantial expenses or potential loss of licenses in the event the trustees of our senior notes or other creditors force an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding or other proceedings, if we commence a voluntary bankruptcy proceedings, or if we are unable to pay our interest or principal payment obligations;  require us to choose between using our cash flow for operations, and growth or paying the interest and/or principal on our indebtedness.  certain vendors and service providers may require that we prepay, prefund or provide them with deposits or security for payments earlier than current payment obligations, which would further hamper our cash flow;  banks, on which we rely for depository and treasury management and payment processing services, may discontinue their relationship with us;  make it more difficult or impossible for us to satisfy capital or net worth requirements or obtain financial bonds required by various state statutes or regulations as part of their licensing regimes, which would place out lending licenses in jeopardy;  insurance companies that provide bonds, which are conditions to our state lending licenses, and insure various risks, including our managers and officers insurance, our employment practices liability insurance or our network security and privacy insurance, may be unwilling to renew or extend existing policies or write new policies;  increase our vulnerability to and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and 11 Table of Contents  limit our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including our senior notes, or to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate and other purposes; and  as experienced by our Predecessor, increase our vulnerability to, and limit our flexibility in, planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the regulatory environment and the industry in which we operate. Our Predecessor reported net losses in prior periods, and there can be no assurance that we will generate income in the future, or that we will be able to successfully achieve or maintain our growth strategy. Our Predecessor reported net losses of $180.9 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, our Predecessor's independent registered public accounting firm included a paragraph in its audit opinion for the year ended December 31, 2017 casting doubt on our Predecessor's ability to continue as a going concern. Our Predecessor engaged in the Restructuring because it was unable to pay its debts as they came due as a result of its high debt burden. The likelihood that we will generate sufficient cash flows in the future to be able to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of our total indebtedness, the difficulties facing our industry as a whole, economic conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate, and we can provide no assurances that we will generate positive net income in the future. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we may not achieve sufficient revenues to sustain or increase profitability. Furthermore, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows, we may be required to engage in additional restructurings or file for bankruptcy protection in the future in order to continue as a going concern. Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness. This could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Interest on the PIK Notes is payable in kind, which will increase the aggregate principal amount of outstanding PIK Notes on each interest payment date. In addition, the terms of the indentures governing our senior notes and the agreement governing our revolving credit facility limit, but do not prohibit, us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness. If we incur any additional indebtedness, the holders of that indebtedness may be entitled to share ratably with our other secured and unsecured creditors in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of our business prior to any recovery by our equity holders. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid in such an event. If new indebtedness, including under our revolving credit facility, is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify, especially with respect to the demands on our liquidity as a result of increased interest commitments. The PIK Notes are effectively subordinated to our secured debt and any liabilities of our subsidiaries. The PIK Notes rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the PIK Notes; equal in right of payment to any of our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and our Secured Notes) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries, including our subsidiaries' obligations, whether as borrower or guarantor, under our revolving credit facility, the Secured Notes and trade payables. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that secure debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment to the PIK Notes (including all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and the Secured Notes) will be available to pay obligations on the PIK Notes only after 12 Table of Contents the secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets, and the assets of our subsidiaries will be available to pay obligations on the PIK Notes only after all claims senior to the PIK Notes have been repaid in full. There may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the PIK Notes then outstanding. The indenture governing the PIK Notes will not prohibit us from incurring additional senior debt or secured debt, nor does it prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, our total consolidated principal amount of indebtedness outstanding was $390.8 million, of which an aggregate of $276.9 million was senior indebtedness and an aggregate of $113.8 million was secured indebtedness. For more information about our outstanding indebtedness, see Note 6 to the accompanying audited financial statements. As of December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries had $167.3 million of indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables, but excluding intercompany obligations and liabilities of a type not required to be reflected on a balance sheet of such subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP) to which the PIK Notes are structurally subordinated. As of December 31, 2018, our revolving credit facility was fully drawn. The PIK Notes are our obligations only and our operations are conducted through, and substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by, our subsidiaries. The PIK Notes are our obligations exclusively and are not guaranteed by any of our operating subsidiaries. We are a holding company, and almost all of our consolidated assets are held by our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to service our debt, including the PIK Notes, depends on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and upon the ability of such subsidiaries to provide us with cash, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise, to pay amounts due on our obligations, including the notes. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make payments on the PIK Notes or to make any funds available for that purpose. Dividends, loans or other distributions to us from such subsidiaries may be subject to contractual and other restrictions and are subject to other business considerations. In addition, our rights and the rights of our creditors, including the holders of the PIK Notes, to participate in the distribution or allocation of the assets of any subsidiary during its liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors, unless we are an unsubordinated creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. Claims from creditors (other than us) against the subsidiaries may include long-term and medium-term debt and short-term borrowings. To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Our ability to make scheduled cash payments on and to refinance or restructure our indebtedness, including our revolving credit facility and Secured Notes, and to fund future capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future, which, to a significant extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our Secured Notes and our other indebtedness. Further, a lack of sufficient cash flow will require us to pay interest on the PIK Notes with payments in kind of additional PIK Notes, which will further increase our amount of outstanding indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including our Secured Notes. We may not be able to restructure or refinance our indebtedness prior to maturity on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest or other debt capital expense. Restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness could also require us to accept 13 Table of Contents more onerous covenants and restrictions on our business operations. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations in an attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The agreement governing our revolving credit facility restricts our ability to conduct asset sales and/or use the proceeds from asset sales. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, or at all, and any proceeds that we receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Covenants in our debt agreements restrict our business in many ways and a default and acceleration under those agreements which are secured could result in the lenders seizing all collateral granted to them as security for the loans. Our debt agreements contain various covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, including customary baskets, generally limit our ability and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:  incur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;  issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;  pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;  prepay, redeem or repurchase debt;  make loans and investments;  enter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;  sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;  engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and  consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our revolving credit facility or our senior notes, the lenders or the holders of our senior notes, as the case may be, could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the applicable indebtedness to be immediately due and payable and the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit under our revolving credit facility. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our revolving credit facility and holders of our Secured Notes could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under the revolving credit facility and as security for our Secured Notes. If we default on our interest payments, or if we are unable to repay, restructure or refinance any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility, the lenders may proceed against the collateral, which includes the defaulted and delinquent accounts of our customers. The collection of defaulted and delinquent accounts from our customers is an important source of cash flow to our business. Any interruption to our normal collection activities, such as would occur if a creditor proceeded against their security interest in those accounts, would likely result in a deterioration of cash flow, loss of liquidity and an inability to meet current and longer term obligations. In addition, if the lenders under our revolving credit facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings or the holders of our Secured Notes accelerate repayment of our Secured Notes, we expect we will not have sufficient assets to repay the amounts outstanding under our other indebtedness, including the PIK Notes. The obligations under our revolving credit facility are secured on a higher priority than obligations under our Secured Notes. That means that, in the case of a foreclosure of our assets, our obligations to the lenders under our revolving credit facility will be satisfied prior to our obligations under our senior notes and the value of the collateral may be insufficient to satisfy all of such obligations. Moreover, as of December 31, 2018, $70.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under the 14 Table of Contents Ivy Credit Agreement has been secured by subsidiaries that do not guarantee our Secured Notes or our revolving credit facility. These obligations are therefore structurally senior to our senior notes and revolving credit facility, as it relates to the non-guarantor subsidiary collateral and payment obligations. The Company's reliance on specialty or other financing may be a risk if such financing sources become unavailable or their cost materially increases. We rely on specialty financing obtained by our unrestricted subsidiaries to provide liquidity for our short term and medium term loans. However, we cannot guarantee that this financing will continue to be available, or continue to be available on reasonable terms. If such specialty financing sources became unwilling or unable to provide financing to us at prices acceptable to us we would need to secure, but may not be successful in securing, additional financing, which would require that we substantially reduce or stop loan originations. As the volume of loans that we make to customers increases, we may require the expansion of our borrowing capacity or the addition of new sources of capital. The availability of these financing sources depends on many factors, some of which are outside of our control. The subsidiaries that enter into these financing arrangements may also experience the occurrence of events of default or breaches of financial or performance covenants under the Ivy Credit Agreement, which would result in a material adverse event that could result in a cross-default in our revolving credit facility. Any such occurrence or breach could result in the applicable lender proceeding against the collateral, the reduction or termination of our access to institutional funding or increase our cost of funding. Increases in the cost of capital or the loss of debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In the future, we may seek to access the debt capital markets to obtain capital to finance growth or refinance existing indebtedness. However, our future access to the debt capital markets could be restricted due to a variety of factors, including our financial condition and any further deterioration of our earnings, cash flows, balance sheet quality, or overall business or industry prospects, adverse regulatory changes, a disruption to or deterioration in the state of the capital markets or a negative bias toward our industry by market participants. Disruptions and volatility in the capital markets could also cause credit providers to restrict availability of new credit. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions, and a potential disruption in the capital markets may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are satisfactory to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, refinance existing indebtedness, make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges and this, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to advance our strategic plans. Additionally, if the capital and credit markets experience volatility, and the availability of funds is limited, third parties with whom we do business may incur increased costs or business disruption and this could adversely affect our business relationships with such third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Changes in credit ratings issued by statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our costs of financing. Credit rating agencies rate our indebtedness based on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating, or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of our indebtedness or placing us on a watch list for possible future 15 Table of Contents downgrading could limit our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs and refinance maturing liabilities or increase the interest rates and our cost of financing. Repayment of our debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries. We are a holding company and our only material assets are the equity interests we hold in our subsidiaries. As a result, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our outstanding debt service and other obligations and such dividends may be restricted by law or the instruments governing our indebtedness or other agreements of our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and other obligations. In addition, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities, and any payments on dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to legal and contractual restrictions on dividends. In addition, payments to us by our subsidiaries will be contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings. Additionally, we may be limited in our ability to cause any future joint ventures to distribute their earnings to us. Subject to certain qualifications, our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of their indebtedness to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict payments from those subsidiaries to us. We can make no assurances that agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit those subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient cash to fund payments of principal, and interest on our outstanding debt obligation, when due. If we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness or other obligations. In addition, the equity interests of other equity holders in any non-wholly-owned subsidiary, such as a joint venture, in any dividend or other distribution made by such entity would need to be satisfied on a proportionate basis with us. These non-wholly-owned subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions, in their financing or other agreements, on their ability to distribute cash to us or a subsidiary guarantor, and, as a result, we may not be able to access their cash flow to service our debt and other obligations. A change in the control of the Company could require us to repay certain of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to do so. Upon the occurrence of a "change of control," as defined in the indenture governing the PIK Notes, subject to certain conditions, we may be required to repurchase the PIK Notes at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount thereof, together with any accrued and unpaid interest. The source of funds for that repurchase will be our available cash or cash generated from operations or other potential sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. We may not have sufficient funds from such sources at the time of any change of control to make the required repurchases of PIK Notes tendered. Our failure to purchase, or to give notice of purchase of, the notes would be a default under the indenture governing the PIK Notes. In addition, a change of control would constitute an event of default under our revolving credit facility and the Secured Notes. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. If a change of control occurs, we may not have enough assets to satisfy all obligations arising under our debt instruments as a result thereof. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we could seek to refinance such indebtedness or obtain a waiver from the applicable creditors. We can make no assurances, however, that we would be able to obtain a waiver or refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 16 Table of Contents We may enter into transactions that would not constitute a change of control that could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under indebtedness. Legal uncertainty regarding what constitutes a change of control and the provisions of agreements governing our indebtedness may allow us to enter into transactions, such as acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, which would not constitute a "change of control," as defined in such agreements, but may increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. Qualified Noteholders and Former Qualified Noteholders, as applicable, will have significant approval rights and their interests may conflict with the interests of our other investors. Subject to certain exceptions, Qualified Noteholders and Former Qualified Noteholders (each as defined under "Description of Equity Securities") have approval rights over certain significant actions by the Company, including the following:  the issuance, purchase, exchange, redemption, repurchase of or determination whether to exercise repurchase rights in respect of any units of the Company or equity securities of any of our subsidiaries;  the adoption of any management incentive plan;  the entering into an agreement to effect a public offering of our securities;  the incurrence of debt by us or any of our subsidiaries other than trade payables or other debt incurred in the ordinary course of business or other debt permitted to be incurred by each of the senior notes and our revolving credit facility;  the refinancing of our senior notes or our revolving credit facility;  the giving by us or our subsidiaries of any guaranties or indemnities in connection with debt or other obligations;  any amendment to our limited liability company agreement or certificate of formation;  the entry into certain change of control transactions and acquisitions by the Company;  any redemption, repurchase or other form of satisfaction of the PIK Notes; and  a change in the principal place of business of the Company to a place outside of the United States. Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC (the "Allianz Noteholder") has an approval right in its sole discretion over any refinancing of our revolving credit facility or the Ivy Credit Agreement. For more information about the rights of the Allianz Noteholder, see "Description of Equity SecuritiesEffect of Certain Debt Refinancings." Even if our board of managers believes that taking a certain action is in the best interests of our security holders, we can provide no assurances that the Qualified Noteholders, the Former Qualified Noteholders or the Allianz Noteholder, as applicable, will consent to the taking of such action. In addition, the Qualified Noteholders and Former Qualified Noteholders have the ability to elect two of the five managers on our board of managers who initially are Eugene Schutt and Jennifer Adams Baldock both of whom served on the board of our Predecessor. To the extent the Allianz Noteholder nominates new managers to replace Mr. Schutt and Ms. Adams Baldock, it could disrupt the continuity of our board and may cause our board to change the course of its strategy for our Company. These provisions could make it difficult for holders of our Common Units to effect changes to our management and may prevent a change of control that is in the best interests of our unitholders. Furthermore, the entities that are Qualified Noteholders or may become Former Qualified Noteholders, including the Allianz Noteholder, are in the business of making investments in companies 17 Table of Contents and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. The Qualified Noteholders or Former Qualified Noteholders may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, given the significant approval rights, certain parties with rights under our limited liability company act agreement may claim that certain actions were not approved appropriately, which could lead third parties to question the validity of actions taken by our board or management team. Prior to the Class B Conversion Event holders of Class A Common Units will have no voting rights. Prior to the Class B Conversion Event (as defined under "Description of Equity Securities"), holders of Class A Common Units will have no voting rights. During this time, holders of Class A Common Units will only have the right to vote on amendments to our limited liability agreement that would have certain negative consequences to them and such holders will have no right to vote in the election of managers. Holders of Class A Common Units will therefore have effectively no ability to control the management and governance of the Company. We are not required to, and likely will not, satisfy our obligations under the PIK Notes in cash. Interest on the PIK Notes accrues at the rate of 10.750% per annum and is payable by increasing the principal amount of a PIK Note or by issuing additional PIK Notes in a principal amount equal to such interest. In addition, we currently expect to satisfy our obligations under the PIK Notes through the issuance additional Class A Common Units either at or prior to maturity pursuant to the optional redemption feature pursuant to the indenture governing the PIK Notes. See "Description of NotesOptional Redemption." As a result, holders of the PIK Notes will not receive any principal or interest payments in cash and will be subject to the risks of holding Class A Common Units described herein. Holders of Class A Common Units will likely experience substantial dilution. Holders of Class A Common Units will be diluted upon the issuance of additional Class A Common Units, either in connection with an additional capital raise or in connection with the redemption of the PIK Notes. We have the ability to redeem the PIK Notes through the issuance of additional Class A Common Units either at or prior to maturity pursuant to the optional redemption feature pursuant to the indenture governing the PIK Notes. See "Description of PIK NotesOptional Redemption." We currently expect to satisfy our obligations under the PIK Notes through such a redemption. Holders of Class A Common Units will experience immediate and substantial dilution upon the issuance of additional Class A Common Units in connection with the redemption of the PIK Notes. Our ability to issue equity securities to finance future operations is limited and subject to the rights of certain investors. As described above, Qualified Noteholders and Former Qualified Noteholders generally must approve issuances of additional units or other equity securities. In addition, under certain circumstances, if we issue additional units, holders of Class B Common Units, Class C Common Units and Class M Common Units have the right to receive additional units of the applicable class such that each existing holder's percentage interest in the Company does not change as a result of the issuance of new units. Furthermore, each holder of at least 3% of the aggregate amount of the Class A Common Units and Class B Common Units that is an "accredited investor" (as defined under the Securities Act) shall have the right to purchase a number of units or other securities proposed to be issued by us equal to such holder's overall percentage interest in the Company, or such lesser number, of the total number of new securities that the Company may propose to issue and sell. These provisions may prevent or discourage us from issuing additional equity, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our operations going forward. 18 Table of Contents We do not expect an active trading market will develop for our Common Units or PIK Notes. There is no trading market for the Common Units or PIK Notes, and we do not intend to apply to list any class of our Common Units or the PIK Notes on any securities exchange or arrange for a quotation on any automated dealer quotation system. We do not expect an active trading market for our Common Units or New PIK notes will develop or be sustained. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any markets that may develop, the ability of the holders of our securities to sell such securities or the prices at which holders may be able to sell their securities. The trading market in our securities may also be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for securities similar to ours and by changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industry generally. Holders of our Common Units or PIK Notes may not be able, at any particular time, sell either the Common Units or PIK Notes at all or at a favorable price. Holders of PIK Notes will not be entitled to any rights with respect to our Class A Common Units, but they will be subject to all changes made with respect to them to the extent we issue Class A Common Units in redemption of the PIK Notes. Holders of PIK Notes will not be entitled to any rights with respect to our Common Units (including, without limitation, voting rights and rights to receive any distributions) prior to the redemption date relating to such PIK Notes (if we have elected to redeem the PIK Notes by delivering solely Class A Common Units (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional unit), but holders of PIK Notes will be subject to all changes affecting our Class A Common Units. For example, if an amendment is proposed to our limited liability company agreement requiring approval of holders of Common Units and the record date for determining the unitholders of record entitled to vote on the amendment occurs prior to the redemption date related to the redemption of PIK Notes (if we have elected to redeem the PIK Notes by delivering solely Class A Common Units (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional unit), such holders will not be entitled to vote on the amendment, although such holder will nevertheless be subject to any changes affecting our Class A Common Units. Risks Related to Our Business We are subject to regulation at both the state and federal levels that is susceptible to varying interpretations, and our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in significant liability to us as well as significant additional costs to bring our business practices into compliance. Our business and products are subject to extensive regulation by state, federal and local governments that may impose significant costs or limitations on the way we conduct or expand our business. In general, these regulations are intended to protect consumers and not our equity holders, bondholders, or lenders. These regulations include those relating to:  usury, interest rates and fees;  deferred presentment/small denomination lending, including terms of loans (such as maximum rates, fees and amounts and minimum durations); limitations on renewals and extensions; and disclosures;  electronic funds transfers;  licensing and posting of fees;  lending practices, such as Truth-in-Lending and fair lending;  unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices in consumer transactions;  check cashing;  money transmission;  currency and suspicious activity recording and reporting;  privacy of personal consumer information; and  prompt remittance of excess proceeds for the sale of repossessed automobiles in certain states in which we operate as a secured lender. 19 Table of Contents Most state laws that specifically regulate our products and services establish allowable fees, interest rates and other financial terms. In addition, many states regulate the maximum amount, maturity, frequency and renewal or extension terms of the loans we provide, as well as the number of simultaneous or consecutive loans. The terms of our products and services vary from state to state in order to comply with the specific laws and regulations of those states. Our business is also regulated at the federal level. Our lending, like our other activities, is subject to routine oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and is subject to supervision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB" or "Bureau"). In addition, our lending and ancillary activities are subject to disclosure and non-discrimination requirements, including under the federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Regulation Z adopted under that act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Regulation B adopted under that act, as well as Fair Credit Reporting Act, or the FCRA, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, and similar state laws, which promote the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies, the Telephone Consumer Protections Act, or the TCPA, and the requirements governing electronic payments and transactions, including the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Regulation E adopted under that act, and the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act and similar state laws, particularly the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which authorize the creation of legally binding and enforceable agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures and, with consumer consent, permits required disclosures to be provided electronically. In 2007, the U.S. Congress effectively prohibited lenders from making certain short-term consumer loans to members of the U.S. military, active-duty reservists and National Guard, and their respective dependents. We are also subject to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and similar state laws, which allow military members and certain dependents to suspend or postpone certain civil obligations, as well as limit applicable rates, so that the military member can devote his or her full attention to military duties. Our operations are also subject to the rules and oversight of the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Treasury related to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, as well as the privacy and data security regulations under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act or FDCPA regulates third-parties who regularly collect or attempt to collect, directly or indirectly, consumer debts owed or asserted to be owed to another person. Although the FDCPA is generally inapplicable to our internal collection activities, the CFPB may impose requirements on creditors that are similar to those imposed on debt collectors under the FDCPA and many states impose similar requirements on creditors some of which, such as the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act in California, may be more stringent than the current federal requirements. In July of 2015, the CFPB released a summary of Proposal it is considering to reform debt collection practices. The CFPB convened a Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Act or SBREFA Consultation processes for both debt collectors and creditors and others engaged in collection activity who may not be debt collectors under the FDCPA. As a result of the SBREFA process for debt collectors a further set of proposals was issued in July 2016 but on July 17, 2017, the CFPB issued guidance regarding the timeline for further debt collection rulemaking. The guidance stated that further rulemaking would occur later in 2017. Notwithstanding this statement, no new rulemaking occurred has happened. In addition, regulations governing debt collection are subject to changing interpretations that differ from jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction. We undertake collection activity relative to debts that consumers owe to us and we use third party collections agencies to collect on debts incurred by consumers of our credit products. Regulatory changes or judicial interpretations could make it more difficult for us and for collections agencies to effectively collect on the loans we originate. Statutes authorizing consumer loans and similar products and services, such as those we offer, typically provide the state agencies that regulate banks and financial institutions or similar state agencies with significant regulatory powers to administer and enforce the law. In most jurisdictions, we are required to apply for a license, meet certain net worth or capital requirements, file periodic written 20 Table of Contents reports regarding business operations, and undergo comprehensive examinations or audits from time to time to assess our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. State attorneys general and financial services regulators scrutinize our products and services and could take actions that may require us to modify, suspend, or cease operations in their respective states. In the aftermath of the 2018 presidential election and changes brought about by the new presidential administration, various state attorneys general and financial services regulators have become more aggressive in their interpretation of statutes and regulations and in prosecution or enforcement of infractions. We regularly receive, as part of comprehensive state examinations or audits or otherwise, comments from state attorneys general and financial services regulators about our business operations and compliance with state laws and regulations. These comments sometimes allege violations of, or deficiencies in complying with, applicable laws and regulations. While we have resolved most such allegations promptly and without penalty, we have been required to pay penalties in certain jurisdictions in the past. We operate in a large number of jurisdictions with varying requirements and we cannot anticipate how state attorneys general and financial services regulators will scrutinize our products and services or the products and services of our industry in the future. If we fail to resolve future allegations satisfactorily, there is a risk that we could be subject to significant penalties, including material fines, orders to make substantial refunds to customers, or that we may lose our licenses to operate in certain jurisdictions. Regulatory authorities and courts have considerable discretion in the way they interpret licensing and other statutes and regulations under their jurisdiction and may seek to interpret or enforce existing regulations in new ways. If we fail to observe, or are not able to comply with, applicable legal requirements (as such requirements may be interpreted by courts or regulatory authorities), we may be forced to modify or discontinue certain product service offerings or to invest additional amounts to bring our product service offerings into compliance, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in some cases, violation of these laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties, orders to make refunds to customers, and other civil and/or criminal penalties. For example, state laws may require lenders that charge interest at rates considered to be usurious or that otherwise violate the law to pay a penalty equal to the principal and interest due for a given loan or loans or a multiple of the finance charges assessed. Depending on the nature and scope of a violation, fines and other penalties for non-compliance of applicable requirements could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The CFPB has adopted rules applicable to our loans that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, on our ability to offer short-term consumer loans, on our ability to obtain electronic payment authorizations, and on our credit facilities. On February 6, 2019, the CFPB released a proposal to rescind a portion of the previously released rule, the portion of the rule that it proposes to maintain has a compliance date in August of 2019. The absence of material changes to these rules could make the continuance of our current business materially less profitable, impractical or impossible and could negatively impact our ability to meet our debt obligations. In addition, both the CFPB and state officials are authorized to bring enforcement actions against companies that violate federal consumer financial laws which could result in significant liability to us as well as significant additional costs to bring our business practices into compliance. Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or Dodd-Frank or the Dodd-Frank Act, created the CFPB. The CFPB became operational in July 2011. On January 4, 2012, Richard Cordray was installed as its director through a recess appointment and in July 2013, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit recently held that the CFPB's single-director structure is constitutional. Whether this decision or other decisions dealing with the constitutionality of the CFPB will be taken up by the U.S. 21 Table of Contents Supreme Court and whether the U.S. Supreme Court will find the CFPB's structure constitutional is unknown. On June 2, 2016, the CFPB issued its Notice of Proposed Rule Making on Payday, Vehicle Title and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans. Following a comment period, on October 5, 2017, the CFPB released its final rule applicable to payday, title and certain high-cost installment loans or the CFPB Rule. The provisions of the CFPB Rule directly applicable to our operations became effective on November 17, 2017. Thus, absent the further proposal issued by the CFPB on February 6, 2019, the CFPB Rule would have been fully effective in November of 2019. As initially promulgated, the CFPB Rule established an ability-to-repay, or ATR, requirements for "covered short-term loans," such as our single-payment loans, and for "covered longer-term balloon-payment loans," such as our revolving lines of credit, as currently structured. It establishes "penalty fee prevention" provisions that will apply to all of our loans, including our covered short-term loans, and our installment loans, which are "covered longer-term loans" under the CFPB Rule. Covered short-term loans are consumer loans with a term of 45 days or less. Covered longer-term balloon payment loans include consumer loans with a term of more than 45 days where (i) the loan is payable in a single payment, (ii) any payment is more than twice any other payment, or (iii) the loan is a multiple advance loan that may not fully amortize by a specified date and the final payment could be more than twice the amount of other minimum payments. Covered longer-term loans are consumer loans with a term of more than 45 days where (i) the total cost of credit exceeds an annual rate of 36%, and (ii) the lender obtains a form of "leveraged payment mechanism" giving the lender a right to initiate transfers from the consumer's account. Post-dated checks, authorizations to initiate ACH payments and authorizations to initiate prepaid or debit card payments are all leveraged payment mechanisms under the CFPB Rule. The ATR provisions of the CFPB Rule apply to covered short-term loans and covered longer-term balloon-payment loans but not to covered longer term loans. Under these provisions, to make a covered short-term loan or a covered longer-term balloon-payment loan, a lender has two options.  A "full payment test," under which the lender must make a reasonable determination of the consumer's ability repay the loan in full and cover major financial obligations and living expenses over the term of the loan and the succeeding 30 days. Under this test, the lender must take account of the consumer's basic living expenses and obtain and generally verify evidence of the consumer's income and major financial obligations.  A "principal-payoff option," under which the lender may make up to three sequential loans, without engaging in an ATR analysis. The first of these so-called Section 1041.6 Loans in any sequence of Section 1041.6 Loans without a 30-day cooling off period between them is limited to $500, the second is limited to two-thirds of the first and the third is limited to one-third of the first. A lender may not use this option if (1) the consumer had in the past 30 days an outstanding covered short-term loan or an outstanding longer-term balloon-payment loan that is not a Section 1041.6 Loan, or (2) the new Section 1041.6 Loan would result in the consumer having more than six covered short-term loans (including Section 1041.6 Loans) during a consecutive 12-month period or being in debt for more than 90 days on such loans during a consecutive 12-month period. For Section 1041.6 Loans, the lender cannot take vehicle security or structure the loan as open-end credit. On February 6, 2019, the CFPB proposed to rescind certain provisions of the CFPB Rule, specifically to repeal the ATR requirement, which the Bureau now refers to as the "mandatory underwriting provisions," and to delay the compliance date for the mandatory underwriting provisions until November 19, 2020. 22 Table of Contents The CFPB Rule's penalty fee prevention provisions, which will apply to all covered loans, may have a greater impact on our operations than the ATR provisions of the CFPB Rule would have had. Under these provisions, if two consecutive attempts to collect money from a particular account of the borrower are unsuccessful due to insufficient funds, the lender cannot make any further attempts to collect from such account unless and until it provides notice of the unsuccessful attempts to the borrower and obtains from the borrower a new and specific authorization for additional payment transfers. Obtaining such authorization will be costly and in many cases not possible. Additionally, the penalty fee prevention provisions will require the lender generally to give the consumer at least three business days' advance notice before attempting to collect payment by accessing a consumer's checking, savings, or prepaid account. These requirements will necessitate revisions to our payment, customer notification, and compliance systems and create delays in initiating automated collection attempts where payments we initiate are initially unsuccessful. Although the CFPB has indicated that it is still considering the penalty fee prevention provisions, if and when these provisions of the CFPB Rule go into effect as written, it will require substantial modifications in our current practices. These modifications would likely increase costs and reduce revenues. Accordingly, this aspect of the CFPB Rule could have a substantial adverse impact on our results of operations. If the CFPB Rule penalty fee provisions, in whole or in part, go into effect substantially as written, or the effort to repeal the ATR provisions fail, these Rules will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These rules would make our lending services, and the continuance of our current business, materially less profitable, impractical, or impossible, and may force us to modify or discontinue substantial parts of our business such as certain product offerings, including short-term and medium-term consumer loans. The CFPB Rules, or portions thereof, would most likely reduce our revenues and cash flow to such an extent that we would likely be unable to meet our debt obligations. In addition to the CFPB Rule, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to conduct supervisory examinations and to adopt other rules that could potentially have a serious impact on our ability to offer short-term consumer loans. The Dodd-Frank Act also empowers the CFPB and state officials to bring enforcement actions against companies that violate federal consumer financial laws. Although it has not yet done so, the CFPB has the authority to adopt rules describing specified acts and practices as being "unfair," "deceptive," or "abusive," and hence unlawful. Various consumer advocacy groups have suggested that aspects of certain short-term loans, such as payday loans, are "abusive" and therefore such loans should be declared unlawful. Should the CFPB adopt such a rule, it could have a serious impact on our ability to offer short-term consumer loans, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The CFPB conducted an initial examination of certain of the retail operations of what was then our newly acquired retail subsidiaries in April of 2012, and issued an examination report in October of 2013, and an examination of our internet operations conducted by our newly acquired internet subsidiaries in February of 2015, and issued an examination report in August of 2015. With respect to these CFPB examinations and reports, these supervised entities undertook various improvements in their operating and compliance procedures, controls and systems, but did not make material changes to their business. We anticipate additional examinations of our operations by the CFPB from time-to-time in the future. Because of the relative newness of the examination process, the confidentiality of that process, and changes in the CFPB under the interim and now the newly appointed director, we can provide no assurances as to how the CFPB's examinations will impact us in the future. In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act's grant of regulatory and supervisory powers to the CFPB, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB's own rules). In these proceedings, 23 Table of Contents the CFPB may be able to obtain cease and desist orders (which may include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief) and monetary penalties ranging from $5,000 per day for ordinary violations of federal consumer financial laws to $25,000 per day for reckless violations and $1 million per day for knowing violations. Also, where a company has violated Title X of Dodd-Frank or CFPB regulations under Title X, Dodd-Frank empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the CFPB (but not for civil penalties). If the CFPB or one or more state officials believe we have violated the foregoing laws or regulations, they may be able to exercise their enforcement powers in ways that would have a material adverse effect on us. Changes in applicable laws and regulations, including adoption of new laws and regulations, and varying regulatory interpretations governing consumer protection, lending practices and other aspects of our business could have a significant adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or ability to meet our obligations, or make the continuance of our current business impractical, unprofitable or impossible. We are subject to the risk that the laws and regulations governing our business are subject to change. State legislatures, the U.S. Congress, and various regulatory bodies may adopt legislation, regulations or rules or adapt varying regulatory interpretations of statutes or regulations that could negatively affect our results of operations or make the continuance of our current business impractical, unprofitable or impossible. For instance, at the federal level, bills have been introduced in Congress since 2008 that would have placed a federal cap of 36% on the APR applicable to all consumer loan transactions. Another bill directed at payday loans would have placed a 15-cent-per-dollar borrowed cap on fees for cash advances, banned rollovers (which is a practice that allows consumers to pay a fee to extend the term of a payday or other short-term consumer loan), and required all lenders to offer an extended payment plan that would have severely restricted many of our payday lending products. Congress, as well as state legislatures and other state and federal governmental authorities have debated, and may in the future adopt, legislation or regulations that could, among other things, limit origination fees for loans, require changes to underwriting or collections practices, require us to be bonded or require us to report consumer loan activity to databases designed to monitor or restrict consumer borrowing activity, impose "cooling off" periods between the time a loan is paid off and another loan is obtained, or require specific ability to repay analyses before loans can be originated. Recent amendments to rules adopted under the Military Lending Act, or "MLA," further restrict the interest rate and other terms that can be offered to certain active duty military personnel and their spouses and dependents. The amended MLA rules became effective on October 1, 2015, and apply to transactions consummated or established after October 3, 2016, for all credit products subject to the rules except credit cards, which have a later operative date. The MLA, as amended, restricts our ability to offer our products to military personnel and their dependents. Failure to comply with the MLA limits our ability to collect principal, interest, and fees from borrowers and may result in civil and criminal liability that could harm our business. Consumer advocacy groups and other opponents of payday and secured lending are likely to continue their efforts before Congress, state legislatures and the CFPB, to adopt laws or promulgate rules that would severely limit, if not eliminate, such loans. Various states have also enacted or considered laws and regulations that could affect our business. Since July 1, 2007, several states in which we operate or previously operated, including South Dakota, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, Delaware, and Virginia, have enacted laws (or in the case of Arizona, allowed the deferred presentment law to expire) that have impacted our short-term consumer loan business by adversely modifying or eliminating our ability to offer the loan products we previously offered in those jurisdictions. Recent state legislation has included the adoption of maximum APRs at rates well below a rate at which short-term consumer lending is profitable, the implementation of statewide consumer databases combined with the adoption of rules limiting the maximum number of payday or other 24 Table of Contents short-term consumer loans any one customer can have outstanding at one time or in the course of a given period of time, the adoption of mandatory cooling-off periods for consumer borrowers and the implementation of mandatory and frequently cost-free installment repayment plan options for borrowers who request them, who default on their loans or who claim an inability to repay their loans. The legislatures in states in which we have substantial operations, such as California, Ohio and Alabama, have introduced bills that seek to impose significant reductions in the APR applicable to our loan products as well as restrictions on the number or frequency of loans and database requirements. In addition, voter referenda, in various states such as South Dakota and Montana, have resulted in the imposition of APR limits substantially lower than those that we generally charge. In Ohio, House Bill 123, or HB 123, was signed by Ohio's Governor on July 30, 2018. HB 123 prohibits credit services organizations, such as the our CSO subsidiary currently operating in Ohio, from brokering an extension of credit if that credit is in a principal amount of less than five thousand dollars, with a term less than 180-days, and that has an annual percentage rate greater than 28%. HB 123 became effective on October 30, 2018, but applies only to loans or extensions of credit made on or after April 28, 2019. While the Company is evaluating alternative products to offer in the Ohio market, if it is unsuccessful in developing alternative compliance products to offer in Ohio, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow will be materially adversely affected. Moreover, if any initiatives similar to those passed in Ohio are successful in the future, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. In addition, under statutory authority, state regulators have broad discretionary power and may impose new licensing requirements, interpret or enforce existing regulatory requirements in different ways or issue new administrative rules, even if not contained in state statutes, that affect the way we do business and may force us to terminate or modify our operations in particular states or affect our ability to renew licenses we hold. Regulators may also impose rules that are generally adverse to our industry. Any new licensing requirements or rules, or new interpretations of existing licensing requirements or rules, or our failure to follow licensing requirements or rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. With respect to our internet operations, in most cases, our subsidiaries are licensed by the jurisdiction in which they offer loans. In the event a state does not have licensing requirements for entities that have no physical presence in the state, the loans are offered under an Idaho license. As of December 31, 2018, our internet operations are licensed or authorized to offer loans to residents of Alabama, Alaska, California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. In Texas and Ohio, our internet operation facilitates loans originated by an unaffiliated third-party lender. In addition to our direct marketing efforts, we utilized the services of certain marketing firms as a source of new customers. These marketing firms may place advertisements on their websites that direct potential customers to our websites or may work with other marketing affiliates that operate separate websites to attract prospective customers whose information may be provided to lenders. As a result, the success of our business depends substantially on the willingness and ability of these marketing firms to provide us with prospective customer at acceptable prices. If regulatory oversight of such marketing activity is increased, through the implementation of new laws or regulations or the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, our ability to use such marketing resources could be restricted or eliminated. It is probable that states in which we do business may propose or enact restrictions on this type of marketing in the future and our ability to use these marketing sources in those states would then be interrupted. In addition, the CFPB has indicated its intention to examine compliance with federal laws and regulations by various sorts of marketing channels and to scrutinize the flow of non-public, private consumer information between the firms that gather and the firms that purchase such information. The California Department of Business Oversight is currently evaluating whether 25 Table of Contents businesses engaged in providing these services should be licensed as brokers or in some other manner. Failure of these marketing firms to comply with applicable laws or regulations, any changes in applicable laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation or implementation of such laws or regulations, could have an adverse effect on our business and could increase negative perceptions of our business and industry. Additionally, the use of these marketing firms could subject us to additional regulatory cost and expense. If our ability to use these sorts of marketing services were impaired, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Further, our internet operations use the automated clearing house funds transfer, or ACH, system to deposit loan proceeds into customers' bank accounts, and our internet business utilizes the ACH system to collect amounts due by withdrawing funds from our customers' bank accounts when we have obtained authorization to do so from the customer. Our ACH transactions are processed by banks and payment processors, and if these banks and payment processors cease to provide ACH processing services or materially limit or restrict our access to these services, we would have to materially alter, or possibly discontinue, some or all of our business if alternative electronic funds transfer processors are not available. Actions by the U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC, and certain state regulators since 2013, referred to as Operation Choke Point, appeared to be intended to discourage banks and ACH payment processors from providing access to the ACH system for certain short-term consumer loan providers, cutting off their access to the ACH system to either debit or credit customer accounts (or both). According to published reports, the Justice Department issued subpoenas to banks and payment processors and the FDIC and other regulators were said to be using bank oversight examinations to discourage banks from providing banking services, including access to the ACH system to certain short-term consumer lenders. This heightened regulatory scrutiny by the Justice Department, the FDIC and other regulators caused banks and ACH payment processors to cease doing business with consumer lenders who are operating legally, without regard to whether those lenders comply with applicable laws, simply to avoid the risk of heightened regulatory scrutiny or even litigation. On June 5, 2014, Community Financial Services of America, a trade association representing short-term lenders and a major payday lender filed a lawsuit against three U.S. banking regulators, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Comptroller of the Currency, alleging that the federal regulators are improperly causing banks to terminate business relationships with payday lenders. The complaint seeks a declaration that the agencies have acted wrongfully and seeks an injunction barring the agencies from certain actions or informally pressuring banks to terminate their relationship with payday lenders. The lawsuit says that Bank of America Corp., Capital Financial One Corp., Fifth Third Bancorp, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and many smaller banks have terminated their relationships with payday lenders. Although the trade association was dismissed as a plaintiff in the lawsuit, several other payday and small loan lenders have joined the lawsuit as plaintiffs and have requested injunctive relief against the agencies. Notwithstanding the Justice Department's formal confirmation that Operation Choke Point had fully concluded, banks continue to refuse to provide services to us and other small-dollar lenders. Moreover, the lawsuit remains pending in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. In addition, the National Automated Clearinghouse Association, or NACHA, has certain operating rules that govern the use of the ACH system. In November 2013, NACHA proposed amendments to these rules. After a public comment period, on July 28, 2014, NACHA revised its proposed amendments and distributed ballots to its membership to solicit votes on the revised amendments. The revised amendments were adopted by NACHA's members in August 2014 and became effective on various dates in 2015 and 2016. These amendments, among other things (1) established certain ACH return rate levels, including an overall ACH return rate level of 15% of the originator's debit entries 26 Table of Contents (and if any of the specified return rate levels are exceeded, the origination practices and activities of the originator would be subject to a new preliminary inquiry process by NACHA), (2) enhanced limitations on certain ACH reinitiating activities, (3) imposed fees on certain unauthorized ACH returns and (4) allow for increased flexibility in how an initial NACHA rules violation investigation can be initiated, which does not change the rules enforcement process, but defines additional circumstances under which NACHA may initiate a risk investigation or rules enforcement proceeding based on the origination of unauthorized entries. The revised amendments provide clarification that certain industries deal with customers who are more likely to experience an insufficient funds scenario and that the review of an originator with returns in excess of certain of the specified thresholds would take into account the originator's business model in conjunction with its ACH origination practices. As a result of these amendments, our access to the ACH system could be restricted, our ACH costs could increase and we may need to make changes to our business practices. Our access to the ACH system could be impaired as a result of actions by regulators to cut off the ACH system to payday lenders or the NACHA rule amendments. The limited number of financial institutions we depend on have and additional financial institutions may in the future choose to discontinue providing ACH system access, treasury management and other similar services to us. If our access to the ACH and other electronic payment systems is impaired, we may find it difficult or impossible to continue some or all of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If we are unable to maintain access to needed financial services on favorable terms, we would have to materially alter, or possibly discontinue, some or all of our business if alternative processors are not available. We cannot currently assess the likelihood of the enactment of any future unfavorable federal or state legislation or regulations. We can make no assurances that further legislative or regulatory initiatives will not be enacted that would severely restrict, prohibit or eliminate our ability to offer small denomination loan products to consumers. Future legislative or regulatory actions could entail reductions of the fees and interest that we are currently allowed to charge, limitations on loan amounts, lengthening of the minimum loan term and reductions in the number of loans a consumer may have outstanding at one time or over a stated period of time or could entail prohibitions against rollovers, consumer loan transactions or other services we offer. Such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects, result of operations, financial condition and cash flows or could make the continuance of our current business impractical, unprofitable or impossible and therefore could impair our ability to meet our obligations and to continue current operations. Moreover, similar actions by states or by foreign countries in which we do not currently operate could limit our opportunities to pursue our growth strategies. As we develop new services, we may become subject to additional federal and state regulations. Certain financial institutions have discontinued and other financial institutions may in the future discontinue or decline to provide financial services to us because of regulatory pressure. Operation Choke Point resulted in certain financial institutions discontinuing our and our competitors' access to banking, payment processing and treasury management services. Operation Choke Point was initially described in an August 22, 2013, letter from thirty-one members of Congress to both the DOJ and the FDIC. The letter stated, "[i]t has come to our attention that the DOJ and the FDIC are leading a joint effort that according to a DOJ official is intended to 'change the structures within the financial system...choking [certain short term lenders] off from the very air they need to survive." The letter from Congress went on to say, "We are especially troubled by reports that the DOJ and FDIC are intimidating some community banks and third party payment processors with threats of heightened regulatory scrutiny unless they cease doing business with online lenders." The letter continued, "As a result, many bank and payment processors are terminating relationships with many of their long-term customers who provide underserved consumers with short-term credit options." 27 Table of Contents In its December 8, 2014, report, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform concluded that the FDIC and DOJ acted improperly in forcing banks to discontinue their relationships with certain targeted business enterprises, including short term lenders. On August 16, 2017, the Department of Justice formally confirmed the end of Operation Choke Point. Notwithstanding this report or the Justice Department announcement, we cannot guarantee that there will be no further adverse impact on our banking relationships, nor can we guarantee that any bank or other financial institution will continue to or undertake to do business with us, which may include such banks or financial institutions declining to participate in our efforts to refinance our existing debt. Any deterioration of our banking relationships, due to Operation Choke Point or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, could make the refinancing of our current indebtedness difficult or impossible, or could make the continuance of our current business impractical, unprofitable or impossible. Short-term consumer lending, including payday lending, is highly controversial and has been criticized as being predatory by certain advocacy groups, legislators, regulators, media organizations and other parties. A significant portion of our revenue and net income comes from loan interest and fees on payday or similar short-term consumer loans and from services we provide our customers. The short-term consumer loans we make may involve APRs exceeding 390%. Consumer advocacy groups and media reports often focus on the costs to a consumer for small denomination loans and claim that such loans can trap borrowers in a "cycle of debt" and claim further that they are predatory or abusive. While we believe that these loans provide substantial benefits when responsibly utilized, the controversy surrounding this activity may result in our and the industry being subject to the threat of adverse legislation, regulation or litigation motivated by such critics. For example, recent litigation against Scott Tucker, Tim Muir, Charles Hallilan and their businesses have focused significant attention on the rest of small-dollar lending. Although involving a different business model, such litigation invites unfair comparisons and casts a negative light on all small-dollar lending. This negative attention could spawn more legislation, regulation, voter referenda, or litigation that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or could make the continuance of our current business impractical, unprofitable or impossible. In addition, if this negative characterization of small consumer loans becomes increasingly accepted by consumers, demand for these loan products could significantly decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, media coverage and public statements that assert some form of inappropriateness in our products and services can lower employee morale, make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees, management and directors, divert management attention and increase expense. Customer complaints or negative public perception of our business could result in a decline in our customer growth and our business could suffer. Our reputation is very important to attracting new customers and securing repeat business relationships with existing customers. While we believe that our recently acquired subsidiaries we have a good reputation and provide customers with a superior experience, there can be no assurance that these subsidiaries will continue to maintain a good relationship with customers or avoid negative publicity. In addition, the ability of our newly acquired subsidiaries to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of their level of service, trustworthiness, business practices and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matterseven if related to seemingly isolated incidents, or even if related to practices not specific to those products and services that offered, such as collection of our own debtcould erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential customers, which would make it difficult to attract new 28 Table of Contents customers and retain existing customers, significantly decrease the demand for our products, result in increased regulatory scrutiny, and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition. Some of our (and our competitors') lending practices in certain states have become or may become the subject of regulatory scrutiny and/or litigation. An unfavorable outcome in ongoing or future litigation or regulatory proceedings could force us to discontinue these business practices and/or make monetary payments. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In most cases, our subsidiaries make consumer loans without any involvement of either affiliated or unaffiliated third parties. In Texas and in Ohio, we offer loans which are made and funded by an unaffiliated third-party lender. While we believe that these multiple-party programs are lawful, they entail heightened legal risk when compared to our single-party loan programs. In an effort to prohibit two-step lending programs similar to the Ohio program previously offered by one of our Ohio subsidiaries, in 2010 the Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Financial Institutions, or the Ohio Division, adopted a rule (which was judicially declared invalid) and entered an order against another lender in regulatory enforcement proceedings (which order was vacated by the same judge that overturned the Ohio Division rule). The Ohio Division waived its right to appeal and agreed to terminate and/or not commence any regulatory proceedings challenging this practice. Given the impending law change in Ohio brought about by HB 123, the current multi-party loan program offered in Ohio must be abandoned by the end of April 2019. Moreover, if there are other changes in law in Ohio or Texas or if other pending litigation successfully advances arguments that defeat either the Texas or Ohio loan programs, we could be forced to discontinue charging fees for cashing money orders or checks that disburse the proceeds of loans and we could also become subject to private class action litigation with respect to fees collected under such programs. Any or all of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Several of our subsidiaries make loans in California under the authority of the California Financing Law, which has no express interest rate caps for loans of $2,500 or more. The California Department of Business Oversight is currently evaluating whethercontrary to both our practice and general industry practicethe interest rate cap applies to loans in an original principal amount of $2,500 or more that are partially prepaid shortly after origination to reduce the principal balance to $2,500 or less. In addition, due to a recent decision by the California Supreme Court in De La Torre v. Cash Call, Inc. , the California Department of Business Oversight or private plaintiffs may argue that notwithstanding the absence of an express statutory maximum on interest rates for loans with principal amounts in excess of $2,500, that loans with triple digit interest rates are unconscionable and therefore unenforceable. Litigation may be brought by private plaintiffs or regulatory action may be initiated on this issue by the California Department of Business Oversight that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Judicial decisions, amendments to the Federal Arbitration Act, or actions by State legislative or regulatory bodies could render the arbitration agreements we use illegal or unenforceable. We include pre-dispute arbitration provisions in our consumer loan agreements. These provisions are designed to allow us to resolve any customer disputes through individual arbitration rather than in court. Our arbitration agreements contain certain consumer-friendly features, including terms that require in-person arbitration to take place in locations convenient for the consumer and provide consumers the option to pursue a claim in small claims court, provide for recovery of certain of the consumer's attorney's fees, require us to pay certain arbitration fees and allow for limited appellate review. However, our arbitration provisions explicitly provide that all arbitrations will be conducted on an individual and not on a class basis. Thus, our arbitration agreements, if enforced, have the effect of shielding us from class action liability. They do not generally have any impact on regulatory enforcement proceedings. 29 Table of Contents We take the position that the Federal Arbitration Act or FAA requires the enforcement in accordance with the terms of arbitration agreements containing class action waivers of the type we use. While many courts, particularly federal courts, have agreed with this argument in cases involving other parties, an increasing number of courts, including courts in California, Missouri, Washington, New Jersey, and a number of other states, have concluded that arbitration agreements with class action waivers are "unconscionable" and hence unenforceable, particularly where a small dollar amount is in controversy on an individual basis. In April 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion case that consumer arbitration agreements meeting certain specifications are enforceable. Because our arbitration agreements differ in several respects from the agreement at issue in that case, this potentially limits the precedential effect of the decision on our business. In addition, Congress has considered legislation that would generally limit or prohibit mandatory pre-dispute arbitration in consumer contracts and has adopted such a prohibition with respect to certain mortgage loans and also certain consumer loans to members of the military on active duty and their dependents. Further, the CFPB adopted a final rule prohibiting the use of mandatory arbitration clauses with class action waivers in consumer financial services contracts, or the CFPB Anti-Arbitration Rule, on July 19, 2017. On November 1, 2017, the President approved a congressional resolution under the Congressional Review Act overturning the CFPB Anti-Arbitration Rule. Accordingly, the CFPB Anti-Arbitration Rule will not become effective, and, pursuant to the Congressional Review Act, the CFPB is prevented from reissuing the disapproved rule in substantially the same form or issuing a new rule that is substantially the same, absent specific legislative authorization for a reissued or new rule Irrespective of Concepcion, some courts continue to find arbitration agreements unenforceable. Thus, it is possible that one or more courts could use the differences between our arbitration agreements and the agreement at issue in Concepcion as a basis for a refusal to enforce our arbitration agreements, particularly if such courts are hostile to our kind of lending or to pre-dispute mandatory consumer arbitration agreements. Further, it is possible that a change in composition at the U.S. Supreme Court, including the recent additions of Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, could result in a change in the U.S. Supreme Court's treatment of arbitration agreements under the FAA. If our arbitration agreements were to become unenforceable for some reason, we could experience an increase to our consumer litigation costs and exposure to potentially damaging class action lawsuits, with a potential material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Any judicial decisions, legislation in Congress or in the various states in which we operate, or other rules or regulations that impair our ability to enter into and enforce pre-dispute consumer arbitration agreements or class action waivers would significantly increase our exposure to class action litigation as well as litigation in plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions and significantly increase our litigation expenses. Such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Provisions of Dodd-Frank limiting interchange fees on debit cards could reduce the appeal of debit cards we distribute and/or limit revenues we receive from our debit card activities. Dodd-Frank contains provisions that require the Federal Reserve Board to adopt rules that would sharply limit the interchange fees that large depository institutions (those that, together with their affiliates, have at least $10 billion of assets) can charge retailers who accept debit cards they issue. On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board set the interchange fee applicable to debit card transactions at 21 cents per transaction. While the statute does not apply to smaller entities, it is possible, and perhaps likely, that Visa, MasterCard and other debit card networks will continue their current practice of establishing the same interchange fees for all issuers or will establish interchange fees for exempt entities at levels significantly below current levels. If this happens, we would expect the issuer and processor of our debit cards to attempt to recover lost interchange revenues by imposing new or higher 30 Table of Contents charges on cardholders and by seeking to capture a greater percentage of card revenues from us. Additional charges on debit cardholders could discourage use of debit cards for consumer transactions, and in either event, our revenues from prepaid debit card distribution would likely decline, perhaps materially. Changes in local rules and regulations such as local zoning ordinances could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition or could make the continuance of our current business impractical, unprofitable or impossible. In addition to state and federal laws and regulations, our business is subject to various local rules and regulations, such as local zoning regulations and permit licensing. Local jurisdictions' efforts to restrict the business of alternative financial services providers through the use of local zoning and permit laws have been on the rise and we anticipate that they will continue on the rise and we anticipate that they will continue on the rise. Any actions taken in the future by local zoning boards or other local governing bodies to require special use permits for, or impose other restrictions on, our ability to provide products and services could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations or force us to attempt to relocate existing stores. Potential litigation and regulatory proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition in future periods. We have been and could in the future become subject to lawsuits, regulatory proceedings or class actions challenging the legality of our lending or other business practices. An adverse ruling in any proceeding of this type could force us to refund fees and/or interest collected, refund the principal amount of advances, pay triple or other multiple damages, pay monetary penalties and/or modify or terminate operations in particular states or nationwide. Defense of any lawsuit, even if successful, could require substantial time and attention of our senior management that would otherwise be spent on other aspects of our business and could require the expenditure of significant amounts for legal fees and other related costs. Settlement of lawsuits may also result in significant payments and modifications to our operations. Adverse interpretations of the law in proceedings in which we are not currently a party could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or could make the continuance of our current business impractical, unprofitable or impossible. A significant portion of our assets are held in a limited number of states. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 11.5% of our total gross finance receivables of $89.8 million were held in Alabama, 11.2% were held in Arizona, 30.4% were held in California, 7.6% were held in Mississippi and 11.5% were held in Virginia. In addition, the outstanding amount of gross finance receivables in Texas and Ohio was $34.1 million consisting of $33.8 million in short-term and $0.3 million in installment loans, which were guaranteed by the Company as part of the CSO program. As a result, if any of the events noted in this "Risk Factors" section were to occur with respect to our retail locations and internet operations in these states, including changes in the regulatory environment, or if the economic conditions in any of these states were to worsen, any such event could significantly reduce our revenue and cash flow and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or could make the continuance of our current business impractical, unprofitable or impossible. 31 Table of Contents Our revenue and revenue less provision for losses from check cashing services may be materially adversely affected if the number of consumer check cashing transactions decreases as a result of technological development or in response to changes in the tax preparation industry. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, approximately 12.0%, 12.6% and 13.6%, respectively, of our revenues were generated from the check cashing business. Recently, there has been increasing penetration of electronic banking services into the check cashing and money transfer industry, including the increasing adoption of prepaid debit cards, direct deposit of payroll checks, electronic payroll payments, electronic transfers of government benefits and electronic transfers using on-line banking and other payment platforms. A recent study by the Federal Reserve Board suggests that payments through electronic transfers are displacing a portion of the paper checks traditionally cashed in our stores by our customers. Employers are increasingly making payroll payments available through direct deposit or onto prepaid debit cards. In addition, state and federal assistance programs are increasingly requiring benefits be delivered either through direct deposit programs or prepaid debit cards, and the federal government has announced initiatives to transition the disbursement of some federal tax refunds to prepaid debit cards. For example, in April 2011, the State of California stopped issuing paper checks to benefits recipients, which adversely affected our check cashing revenue in that state. Moreover, the rise of on-line payment systems that allow for electronic check and credit card payments to be made directly to individuals has further contributed to the decline in this market. To the extent that checks received by our customer base are replaced with such electronic transfers or electronic transfer systems developed in the future, both the demand for our check cashing services and our revenues from our check cashing business could decrease. In addition, a significant part of our business involves the cashing of tax refund checks. Recent changes in the tax preparation industry, including tax preparers offering prepaid debit cards as an alternative to tax refund checks and a decrease in the number of tax preparers offering refund anticipation loans (which are typically disbursed by checks at the offices of the tax preparer) could cause the number of tax refund checks we cash to decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If our estimates of our allowance for loan losses and accrual for third party losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We utilize a variety of underwriting criteria, actively monitor the performance of our consumer loan portfolio and maintain an allowance for losses on loans we underwrite (including fees and interest) at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan receivables portfolio. To estimate the appropriate level of loan loss reserves, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability, including the total amount of loans outstanding, historical loans charge-offs, our current collection patterns and current economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts and our provision for loan losses is based in large part on our historic loss experience. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to predict how the widespread loss of jobs, housing foreclosures and general economic uncertainty may affect our loan loss allowance, our provision may be inadequate. In addition, expansion of our consumer loan portfolios has resulted and will continue to result in a higher provision for loan losses. Additionally, in our retail credit services organization business, we issue independent third-party lenders letters of credit to guarantee repayment of their extending credit to our customers. We employ a methodology similar to that for estimating our own loan loss reserves to establish an accrual for doubtful accounts of these third-party lenders. As of December 31, 2016, our loan loss allowance was $16.2 million and in 2016 we had a net charge off of $92.4 million related to losses on our loans. As of December 31, 2017, our loan loss allowance was $16.3 million and in 2017 we had a net charge off of $97.5 million related to losses on our loans. As of December 31, 2018, our loan loss allowance was $3.5 million and in 2018 we had a net charge off of $67.8 million during the Predecessor period and ($1.5 million) during the Successor period related to 32 Table of Contents losses on our loans. Our loan loss allowance, however, is an estimate, and if actual loan losses are materially greater than our loan loss allowance, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. The failure of third parties who provide products, services or support to us to maintain their products, services or support could disrupt our operations or result in a loss of revenue. We are reliant on third parties to provide certain products, services and support that are material to our business. In the event such parties become unwilling or unable to continue to provide such products, services or support to us, our business operations could be disrupted and our revenue could be materially and adversely affected. These risks may be exacerbated by our financial condition, as counterparties may consider credit risk in relation to doing business with us. For example:  Our prepaid debit card business depends on our agreements for related services with Insight, which is now owned by GreenDot. If any disruption in this relationship occurs, our revenue generated as an agent for Insight's product offerings and one of the central focuses for our future growth strategy may be adversely affected.  Our money transfer and money order business depends on our agreements for such services with Western Union. If any disruption in these relationships occurs, our revenue generated from our money order and money transfer product offerings may be adversely affected. Approximately $5.2 million in 2016, $4.4 million in 2017, and $4.2 million in 2018, or 1.3%, 1.2% and 1.2%, respectively, of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018 was related to our money transfer and money order services, respectively.  We also have product and support agreements with various other third-party vendors and suppliers. If a third-party provider fails to provide its product or service or to maintain its quality and consistency, we could lose customers and related revenue from those products or services, or we could experience a disruption in our operations, any of which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  If any of the independent third-party lenders that originate the consumer loans offered under the Texas credit access business or the Ohio credit service organization business stops, curtails, or makes material changes to its lending, and we are unable to replace them, we could lose customers and related revenue from those products or services, or we could experience a disruption in our operations, any of which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Various payment processors, on which we rely to present checks or process debit card transactions, and banks on which we rely for depository and treasury management services, may succumb to regulatory pressure, such as those pressures that were exerted during the now discontinued Operation Choke Point or for other reasons, and decline to process future transactions for us or conduct any business with us which could cause a disruption in our operations that may adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition or could make the continuance of our current business impractical, unprofitable or impossible. To the extent that our current and future business growth strategy involves new store acquisitions and our failure to manage our growth or integrate or manage newly acquired stores may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may attempt to grow through the acquisition and opening of new stores. The acquisition or opening of additional stores may impose costs on us and subject us to numerous risks, including:  costs associated with identification of store locations to be acquired and negotiation of acceptable lease terms; 33 Table of Contents  costs associated with leasing and construction;  exposure to new or unexpected changes to existing regulations as we enter new geographic markets;  costs associated with, and consequences related to our failure to obtain, necessary regulatory approvals, including state licensing approvals for change-of-control;  integration of acquired operations or businesses, including the transition to our information technology systems;  local zoning or business license regulations;  the loss of key employees from acquired businesses and the ability to attract and retain employees in connection with store openings;  diversion of management's attention from our core business;  incurrence of additional indebtedness (if necessary to finance acquisitions or openings);  assumption of contingent liabilities;  the potential impairment of acquired assets;  the possibility that tax authorities may challenge the tax treatment of future and past acquisitions;  incurrence of significant immediate write-offs; and  performance which may not meet expectations. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to expand our business successfully through additional store acquisitions. Our failure to successfully expand, manage or complete the integration acquired businesses may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may not realize the expected benefits of acquisitions because of integration difficulties and other challenges. The success of any acquisition depends, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquired business with our business and our ability to increase its operating-level performance in line with our historical operating-level performance. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming and may not result in the anticipated improvements to operating-level performance. The difficulties of integrating the operation of a business may include, among others:  failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;  failure to achieve expected synergies or cost savings;  unanticipated issues in integrating information, technology and other systems;  unanticipated challenges in implementing our short-term consumer lending practices in acquired stores or in marketing loan products to their existing customers;  unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; and  unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. We may not accomplish the integration of the acquired business smoothly, successfully or with the anticipated costs or time frame. The diversion of the attention of management from our operations to the integration effort and any difficulties encountered in combining operations could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition and could adversely affect our business. 34 Table of Contents We may not be successful at entering new businesses or broadening the scope of our existing product and service offerings. We may enter into new businesses that are adjacent or complementary to our existing businesses and that broaden the scope of our existing product and service offerings. For example, in 2012 we entered the business of offering loan products over the internet through the acquisition of DFS, and in 2015 and 2016, we expanded our installment loan program with longer term and greater principal amounts at lower interest rates. We may not achieve our expected growth if we are not successful in entering these new businesses or in broadening the scope of our existing product and service offerings. In addition, entering new businesses and broadening the scope of our existing product and service offerings may require significant upfront expenditures that we may not be able to recoup in the future. These efforts may also divert management's attention and expose us to new risks and regulations. As a result, entering businesses and broadening the scope of our existing product and service offerings may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business, our operating results and growth could suffer. Our future success depends to a significant degree upon the members of our senior management. The loss of the services of members of senior management could harm our business and prospects for future development. Our continued growth also will depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional skilled management personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain the requisite personnel, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. We are dependent on hiring an adequate number of hourly employees to run our business and are subject to government regulations concerning these and our other employees, including minimum wage laws. These laws and regulations together with other factors influencing labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our workforce is comprised primarily of employees who work on an hourly basis. In certain areas where we operate, there is significant competition for employees. Our ability to continue to expand our operations depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees. The lack of availability of an adequate number of hourly employees, geographically-driven market influences on labor costs, or increases in wages and benefits to current employees could adversely affect our operations. We are subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees, including the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the National Labor Relations Act, the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and various federal and state laws governing various matters including minimum wage and break requirements, union organizing, exempt status classification, health benefits, unemployment and employment taxes and overtime and working conditions. Although we were not a party to the litigation, a recent decision by the California Supreme Court addressing when and how wages and overtime should be calculated for California employees may have a material adverse effect on our business. The outcome of other cases pending before the California Supreme Court may result in even higher labor costs in California. Legislative increases in the federal minimum wage, the increasing number of state and local legislative increases to the minimum wage, and other regulatory changes in exempt status classification, as well as increases in additional labor cost components, such as employee benefit costs, workers' compensation insurance rates, compliance costs and fines, as well as the cost of litigation in connection with these regulations, would increase our labor costs. Furthermore, if we are unable to locate, attract, train or retain qualified personnel, or if our costs of labor increase significantly, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 35 Table of Contents Competition in the retail financial services industry is intense and could cause us to lose market share and revenue. The industry in which we operate has low barriers to entry and is highly fragmented and very competitive. In addition, we believe that the market will become more competitive as the industry continues to consolidate. We compete with other check cashing stores, short-term consumer lenders, internet lenders, mass merchandisers, grocery stores, banks, savings and loan institutions, other financial services entities and other retail businesses that cash checks, offer short-term consumer loans, sell money orders, provide money transfer services or offer similar products and services. Some of our competitors have larger and more established customer bases, and substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources, than we do. For example, Wal-Mart offers a general-purpose reloadable prepaid debit card and also offers check cashing services, money transfers and bill payments through its "Money Centers" in select locations. In addition, short-term consumer loans are increasingly being offered by local banks and employee credit unions. Our stores also face competition from automated check cashing machines deployed in supermarkets, convenience stores and other venues by large financial services organizations. In addition, our competitors may operate, or begin to operate, under business models less focused on legal and regulatory compliance than ours, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. We can make no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully against any or all of our current or future competitors. As a result, we could lose market share and our revenue could decline, thereby affecting our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness and fund our operations. Our competitors' use of other business models could put us at a competitive disadvantage and have a material adverse effect on our business. We operate our business pursuant to the laws and regulations of the states in which we conduct business, including compliance with the maximum fees allowed and other limitations and we are licensed in every state in which we lend and in which a license is required. Some of our competitors, especially certain internet lenders, operate using other business models, including a "single-state model" where the lender is generally licensed in one state and follows only the laws and regulations of that state regardless of the state in which the customer resides and the lending transaction takes place, an "offshore model" where the lender is not licensed in any U.S. state and does not typically comply with any particular state's laws or regulations or a "tribal model" where the lender follows the laws of a Native American tribe regardless of the state in which the lender is located, the customer resides and the lending transaction takes place. Competitors using these models may have higher revenue per customer and significantly less burdensome compliance requirements, among other advantages. Additionally, negative perceptions about these models could cause legislators or regulators to pursue additional industry restrictions that could affect the business model under which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. A reduction in demand for our products and services and failure by us to adapt to such reduction could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The demand for a particular product or service we offer may be reduced due to a variety of factors, such as regulatory restrictions that decrease customer access to particular products, the availability of competing products or changes in customers' preferences or financial conditions. Should we fail to adapt to significant changes in our customers' demand for, or access to, our products or services, our revenues could decrease significantly and our operations could be harmed. Even if we make changes to existing products or services or introduce new products or services to fulfill customer demand, customers may resist or may reject such products or services. Moreover, the effect of any product change on the results of our business may not be fully ascertainable until the change has been 36 Table of Contents in effect for some time and by that time it may be too late to make further modifications to such product or service without causing further harm to our business, results of operations and financial condition. Demand for our products and services is sensitive to the level of transactions effected by our customers, and accordingly, our revenues could be affected negatively by a general economic slowdown. We anticipate that a significant portion of our revenues will be derived from cashing checks and consumer lending. An economic slowdown could cause deterioration in the performance of our consumer loan portfolio and in consumer demand for our financial products and services. For example, a significant portion of our check cashing business is generated by cashing payroll checks and any prolonged economic downturn or increase in unemployment could have a material adverse effect on such business. In addition, reduced consumer confidence and spending may decrease the demand for our other products and services. Also, any changes in economic factors that adversely affect consumer transactions and employment could reduce the volume of transactions that we process and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our future growth and financial success will be harmed if there is a decline in the use of prepaid debit cards as a payment mechanism or if there are adverse developments with respect to the prepaid debit card services industry in general. Our business strategy is dependent, in part, upon the general growth in demand for prepaid debit cards. As the market for prepaid debit card services matures, consumers may find prepaid debit cards to be less attractive than traditional bank solutions. Further, other alternatives to prepaid debit cards may develop and limit the growth of, or cause a decline in the demand for, prepaid debit cards. In addition, negative publicity surrounding other prepaid debit card services providers could impact our business and prospects for growth to the extent it adversely impacts the perception of prepaid debit card services industry among consumers. If consumers do not continue to increase their usage of prepaid debit card services, our operating revenues may remain at current levels or decline. Predictions by industry analysts and others concerning the growth of prepaid debit card services as an electronic payment mechanism may overstate the growth of an industry, segment or category, and no undue reliance should be placed upon them. The projected growth may not occur or may occur more slowly than estimated. If consumer acceptance of prepaid debit card services does not continue to develop or develops more slowly than expected or if there is a shift in the mix of payment forms, such as cash, credit cards, traditional debit cards and prepaid debit cards, away from our products and services, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Disruptions in the credit markets may negatively impact the availability and cost of our short-term borrowings, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. If our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our working capital and other liquidity needs, we may need to rely on the banking and credit markets to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, as experienced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility. Our access to funds under our credit facility is dependent on the ability of the parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments. Those funding sources may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from us and other borrowers within a short period of time. In addition, the effects of a global recession and its effects on our operations could cause us to have difficulties in complying with the terms of our revolving credit facility. 37 Table of Contents Longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our ability to refinance our outstanding indebtedness on favorable terms, if at all. The lack of availability under, and the inability to subsequently refinance, our indebtedness could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures, including acquisitions, and reducing or eliminating other discretionary uses of cash. The use of personal data in credit underwriting is highly regulated. The FCRA regulates the collection, dissemination and use of consumer information, including consumer credit information. Compliance with the FCRA and related laws and regulations concerning consumer reports has recently been under regulatory scrutiny. The FCRA requires us to provide a Notice of Adverse Action to a loan applicant when we deny an application for credit, which, among other things, informs the applicant of the action taken regarding the credit application and the specific reasons for the denial of credit. The FCRA also requires us to promptly update any credit information reported to a consumer reporting agency about a consumer and to allow a process by which consumers may inquire about credit information furnished by us to a consumer reporting agency. Historically, the FTC has played a key role in the implementation, oversight, enforcement and interpretation of the FCRA. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has primary supervisory, regulatory and enforcement authority of FCRA issues. Although the FTC also retains its enforcement role regarding the FCRA, it shares that role in many respects with the CFPB. The CFPB has taken a more active approach than the FTC, including with respect to regulation, enforcement and supervision of the FCRA. Changes in the regulation, enforcement or supervision of the FCRA may materially affect our business if new regulations or interpretations by the CFPB or the FTC require us to materially alter the manner in which we use personal data in our credit underwriting. The oversight of the FCRA by both the CFPB and the FTC and any related investigation or enforcement activities may have a material adverse impact on our business, including our operations, our mode and manner of conducting business and our financial results. If the information provided by customers to us is incorrect or fraudulent, we may misjudge a customer's qualification to receive a loan, and any inability to effectively identify, manage, monitor and mitigate fraud risk on a large scale could cause us to incur substantial losses, and our operating results, brand and reputation could be harmed. As we expand the number of products that have lower APRs than our short and medium term products, this expansion is largely predicated on effective loan underwriting resulting in acceptable customer profitability. Lending decisions made using our proprietary scoring models are based partly on information provided by loan applicants. To the extent that these applicants provide information in a manner that is unverifiable, the credit score delivered by our proprietary scoring methodology may not accurately reflect the associated risk. In addition, data provided by third party sources is another component of the decision methodology and this data may contain inaccuracies. Our resources, technologies and fraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud. New technologies, such as block chain and cryptocurrencies, may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use. Inaccurate analysis of credit data that could result from false loan application information could harm our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our proprietary scoring models use identity and fraud checks analyzing data provided by external databases to authenticate each customer's identity. The level of our fraud charge-offs and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if fraudulent activity were to significantly increase. Our internet operations are particularly subject to fraud because of the lack of face-to-face interactions and document review. If applicants assume false identities to defraud us or consumers 38 Table of Contents simply have no intent to repay the money they have borrowed we will incur higher loan losses. We may incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor and mitigate fraud risk using our proprietary credit and fraud scoring models. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as fraud. Over the past several years, we and others in our industry have had customers and former customers contacted by unknown criminals making telephone calls attempting to collect debt, purportedly on our behalf. These criminals are often successful in fraudulently inducing payments to them. Since fraud is perpetrated by increasingly sophisticated individuals and "rings" of criminals, we continue to update and improve the fraud detection and prevention capabilities of our proprietary scoring models. If these efforts are unsuccessful then credit quality and customer profitability will erode. If credit and/or fraud losses increased significantly due to inadequacies in underwriting or new fraud trends, new customer originations may need to be reduced until credit and fraud losses returned to target levels, and business could contract. It may be difficult or impossible to recoup funds underlying loans made in connection with inaccurate statements, omissions of fact or fraud. If credit or fraud losses were to rise, this would significantly reduce our profitability. High profile fraudulent activity could also lead to regulatory intervention, negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and require us, and the originating lenders, to take steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase our costs. Any of the above risks could lead to litigation, significantly increased expenses, reputational damage, reduced use and acceptance of our products and services or new regulations and compliance obligations, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. If we do not effectively price the credit risk of our prospective or existing customers, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Our business has much higher rates of charge-offs than traditional lenders. Accordingly, we must price our loan products to take into account the credit risks of our customers. In deciding whether to extend credit to prospective customers and the terms on which to provide that credit, including the price, we rely heavily on proprietary scoring models. These models take into account, among other things, information from customers, third parties and an internal database of loan records gathered through monitoring the performance of our customers over time. The failure of our scoring models to effectively price credit risk could lead to higher-than-anticipated customer defaults, which could lead to higher charge-offs and losses for us, or overpricing, which could cause the loss of customers. Our models could become less effective over time, receive inaccurate information or otherwise fail to accurately estimate customer losses in certain circumstances. If we are unable to maintain and improve our proprietary scoring models, or if they do not adequately perform, they may fail to adequately predict the creditworthiness of customers or to assess prospective customers' financial ability to repay their loans. This could further hinder our growth and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Failure to keep up with the rapid changes in e-commerce and the uses and regulation of the Internet could harm our business. Providing products and services over the internet is dynamic and relatively new. Our failure to keep pace with technological change, consumer use habits, internet security risks, risks of system failure or inadequacy, and governmental regulation and taxation, may adversely impact our business. In addition, consumer concerns about fraud, computer security and privacy may discourage additional consumers from adopting or continuing to use the internet to conduct financial transactions. Expansion 39 Table of Contents of our customer base requires that we appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to conduct their financial services transactions. If these consumers prove to be less profitable than our traditional retail customers, and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs, including our cost of acquiring new customers, our business could be adversely impacted. Our revenue and revenue less provision for losses from check cashing services may be materially adversely affected if the number and amount of checks we cash that go uncollected significantly increase. When we cash a check, we assume the risk that we will be unable to collect from the check payer. We may not be able to collect from check payers as a result of a payer having insufficient funds in the account, on which a check was drawn, stop payment orders issued by a payer or check fraud. If the number or amount of checks we cash that are uncollected increases significantly, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Any disruption in the availability or the security of our information systems or our internet lending platform or fraudulent activity could adversely affect our operations or subject us to significant liability or increased regulation. We depend on our information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. Our information systems include point of sale ("POS") systems in our retail locations and a management information system. Our POS systems are fully operational in all retail locations. The management information system is designed to provide summary and detailed information to our regional and corporate managers at any time through the internet. In addition, this system is designed to manage our credit risk and to permit us to maintain adequate cash inventory, reconcile cash balances on a daily basis and report revenues and expenses to our headquarters. If the POS system fails to perform as we anticipate, if there are unanticipated problems with the integration of customer information, or if there is any disruption in the availability of our POS, information systems or internet lending platform these events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business is also dependent upon our employees' ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as internet support, call center activities, and processing and servicing consumer loans. A shut-down of or inability to access the facilities in which our internet operations and other technology infrastructure are based, such as a power outage, a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems, or sustained or repeated disruptions of such systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis and could result in a deterioration of our ability to underwrite, approve and process internet consumer loans, provide customer service, perform collections activities, or perform other necessary business functions. Any such interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our business involves the storage and transmission of consumers' non-public, private information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We are entirely dependent on the secure operation of our websites and systems as well as the operation of the internet generally. While we have incurred no material cyber-attacks or security breaches to date, a number of other companies have disclosed cyber-attacks and security breaches, some of which have involved intentional attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or both. Although we devote what we believe to be appropriate resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our customers, our security measures may not provide absolute security. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these 40 Table of Contents types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Company such as persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications or if we expand into new countries. If an actual or perceived breach of security occurs, customer and/or supplier perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could result in the loss of customers, suppliers or both. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third party experts and consultants. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our customers, or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, many of our customers provide personal information, including bank account information when applying for consumer loans. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including customer bank account and other personal information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction data being breached or compromised. Data breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues. Our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, including "denial-of-service" type attacks. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Security breaches, including any breach of our systems or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of consumers' non-public, private information, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. In addition, many of the third parties who provide products, services or support to us could also experience any of the above cyber risks or security breaches, which could impact our customers and our business and could result in a loss of customers, suppliers or revenue. In addition, criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as fraud. Over the past several years, we and others in our industry have had customers and former customers contacted by unknown criminals making telephone calls attempting to collect debt, purportedly on our behalf. These criminals are often successful in fraudulently inducing payments to them. Any of these events could result in a loss of revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer data could expose us to protracted and costly litigation and penalties and cause us to lose customers. In the course of operating our business, we are required to manage, use, and store large amounts of personally identifiable information, consisting primarily of confidential personal and financial data regarding our customers. We also depend on our IT networks and systems to process, store, and transmit this information. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to 41 Table of Contents protect this information. Security breaches involving our systems and infrastructure could lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, as well as shutdowns or disruptions of our systems. If any person, including our employees or those of third-party vendors, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to costly litigation, monetary damages, fines, and/or criminal prosecution. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer data by any person, whether through systems failure, unauthorized access to our IT systems, fraud, misappropriation, or negligence, could result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of customers. Any unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could subject us to liability under data privacy laws and adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations, and financial condition. Our ability to collect payment on loans and maintain accurate accounts may be adversely affected by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, technical errors and similar disruptions. The automated nature of our internet operations may make it an attractive target for hacking and potentially vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our platform, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, in which case there would be an increased risk of fraud or identity theft, and we may experience losses on, or delays in the collection of amounts owed on, a fraudulently induced loan. In addition, the software that we have developed to use in our daily operations is highly complex and may contain undetected technical errors that could cause our computer systems to fail. Because our loans made over the internet involve very limited manual review, any failure of our computer systems involving our scoring models and any technical or other errors contained in the software pertaining to our proprietary system could compromise the ability to accurately evaluate potential customers, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, any failure of our computer systems could cause an interruption in operations and result in disruptions in, or reductions in the amount of, collections from the loans we made to customers. If any of these risks were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition. Security breaches, cyber-attacks, or fraudulent activity could result in damage to our operations or lead to reputational damage. A security breach or cyber-attack of our computer systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation. Regardless of the security measures that we may employ, our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or other similar disruptive problems. If we were to experience a security breach or cyber-attack, we could be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including:  expenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyber-attack;  liability for stolen assets or information;  costs of repairing damage to our systems;  lost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack;  increased costs of cyber security protection;  costs of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business; and  damage to our reputation causing customers and investors to lose confidence in us. 42 Table of Contents Our success and future growth depend significantly on our successful marketing efforts, and if such efforts are not successful, our business and financial results may be harmed. While we may intend to dedicate significant resources to marketing efforts and, when possible, to introduce new loan products and expand into new states, our ability to attract qualified borrowers depends in large part on the success of these marketing efforts and the success of the marketing channels we use to promote our products. Our marketing channels include search engine optimization, search engine marketing, preapproved direct mailings, paid media advertising, and acquiring new customers from various marketing firms. If any of our current marketing channels become less effective, if we are unable to continue to use any of these channels, if the cost of using these channels were to significantly increase or if we are not successful in generating new channels, we may not be able to attract new borrowers in a cost-effective manner or convert potential borrowers into active borrowers. If we are unable to recover our marketing costs through increases in the number of customers and in the number of loans made by visitors to product websites, or if we discontinue our marketing efforts, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition. Any decrease in our access to preapproved marketing lists from credit bureaus or other developments impacting our use of direct mail marketing could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. We market certain of our medium term loan products through direct mailings of preapproved loan offers to potential customers. Our marketing techniques identify candidates for preapproved loan mailings in part through the use of preapproved marketing lists purchased from credit bureaus. If access to such preapproved marketing lists were lost or limited due to regulatory changes prohibiting credit bureaus from sharing such information or for other reasons, our growth could be adversely affected. If the cost of obtaining such lists increases significantly, it could substantially increase customer acquisition costs and decrease profitability. Similarly, federal or state regulators or legislators could limit access to these preapproved marketing lists with the same effect. In addition, preapproved direct mailings may become a less effective marketing tool due to over-penetration of direct mailing lists. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business may suffer if our trademarks or service marks are infringed. We rely on trademarks and service marks to protect our various brand names in our markets. Many of these trademarks and service marks have been a key part of establishing our business in the communities in which we operate. We believe these trademarks and service marks have significant value and are important to the marketing of our services. We can make no assurances that the steps we have taken or will take to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our rights or the use by others of features based upon, or otherwise similar to, ours. In addition, although we believe we have the right to use our trademarks and service marks, we can make no assurances that our trademarks and service marks do not or will not violate the proprietary rights of others, that our trademarks and service marks will be upheld if challenged, or that we will not be prevented from using our trademarks and service marks, any of which occurrences could harm our business. Part of our business is seasonal, which causes our revenue to fluctuate and may adversely affect our ability to service our debt. Our business is seasonal due to the impact of our customers cashing their tax refund checks with us and using the related proceeds in connection with our other products and services, such as prepaid debit cards. Also, our consumer loan business declines slightly in the first calendar quarter as a result 43 Table of Contents of customers' receipt of tax refund checks. If our revenue were to fall substantially below what we would normally expect during certain periods, our annual financial results would be adversely impacted, as would our ability to service our debt. Our stores are currently carrying less cash as a result of costs associated with the Restructuring. We incurred significant expenses in connection with the Restructuring, which has resulted in a reduction in our cash balance. As a result, we are carrying less cash at our stores, which could result in us being unable to make loans to potential customers and hurt our competitiveness in the marketplace. If we are unable to meet customer demands, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to replenish the cash balances at our stores on the expected timeline or at all. Because we maintain a significant supply of cash in our stores, we may be subject to cash shortages due to robbery, employee errors and theft. Since our business requires us to maintain a significant supply of cash in each of our stores, we are subject to the risk of cash shortages resulting from robberies, as well as employee errors and theft. We can make no assurances that robberies, employee errors and theft will not occur. The extent of these cash shortages could increase as we expand the nature and scope of our products and services. Any such cash shortages could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If our insurance coverage limits are inadequate to cover our liabilities, if we are unable to obtain insurance or bonds due to our financial condition, if our insurance costs rise, or we suffer losses due to one or more of our insurance carriers defaulting on their obligations, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. As a result of the liability risks inherent in our lines of business we maintain liability insurance intended to cover various types of property, casualty and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time, depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insured basis. Our insurance policies are subject to annual renewal. The coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate, and we may not be able to obtain insurance or bonds in the future on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, our insurance premiums and our self-insured retentions may be subject to increases in the future, which increases may be material. Furthermore, the losses that are insured through commercial insurance are subject to the credit risk of those insurance companies. We can make no assurances that such insurance companies will remain creditworthy in the future. Inadequate insurance coverage limits, increases in our insurance costs or losses suffered due to one or more of our insurance carriers defaulting on their obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our operations could be impacted by any future government shutdowns. If any future government shutdown, similar to the one that lasted from December 2018 to February 2019, were to occur and continue for an extended period of time or if the IRS were to become unable to timely distribute tax refunds, collections from our customers could be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 44 Table of Contents Our operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could adversely impact our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could adversely impact our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. For example, the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks may directly or indirectly affect economic conditions, which could in turn adversely affect demand for our services. In the event of a major natural or man-made disaster, such as hurricanes, floods, fires or earthquakes, we could experience loss of life of our employees, destruction of facilities or business interruptions, any of which could materially adversely affect us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. economy and worldwide financial markets. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our financial condition, operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected in the event of a catastrophic loss for which we are self-insured. We are self-insured with respect to our employee health insurance program and certain commercial, property and casualty risks. Based on management's assessment and judgment, we have determined that it is generally more cost effective to self-insure these risks. The risks and exposures we self-insure include, but are not limited to, flood, theft, counterfeits, and our employee health insurance program. We also maintain insurance contracts with independent insurance companies that provide certain worker's compensation coverage, disability income coverage, certain employment practices coverage, and life insurance coverage. In addition, we maintain director and officer liability coverage and certain property insurance contracts with independent insurance companies. Some of these coverages may be subject to large self-insured retentions. Some of these insurance companies may refuse to renew our policies due to our financial condition. We also maintain certain stop-gap coverage for catastrophic losses under our employee health insurance program. Should there be catastrophic loss from events for which we are self-insured or adverse court or similar decisions in any area in which we are self-insured, our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected. Adverse real estate market fluctuations could affect our profits. We lease the majority of our store locations. A significant rise in overall lease costs may result in an increase in our store occupancy costs as we open new locations and renew leases for existing locations. 45 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Various of the statements made herein under the captions "Summary", "Risk Factors", "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", "Business" and elsewhere, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of, and subject to, the protections of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.

This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to those set forth under "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this prospectus, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to "we," "our," "us," and the "Company" refer to CCF Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and its consolidated subsidiaries or Community Choice Financial Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Restructuring (as described below), as applicable. All periods presented prior to the closing of the Restructuring on December 12, 2018 represent the operations of our Predecessor. Unless otherwise specified, all results of operations information for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflect the full year. References to "Successor" or "Successor Company" relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to December 12, 2018. References to "Predecessor" or "Predecessor Company" refer to the financial position and results of operations of Community Choice Financial Inc. on and before December 12, 2018. Overview We are a provider of alternative financial services to unbanked and under-banked consumers. We were formed in 2018 and continued, without interruption, the operations of our Predecessor. As a result of the Restructuring, we succeeded to the business and operations of Community Choice Financial Inc., which we refer to as our Predecessor. We provide our customers a variety of financial products and services, including short-term and medium-term consumer loans, check cashing, prepaid debit cards, and other services that address the specific needs of our customers. Through our customer focused business model, we provide our customers with access to financial services through our retail locations and our websites. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 471 retail locations across 12 states and were licensed to deliver similar financial services over the internet in 29 states. The 2018 Restructuring During the year ended December 31, 2017, our Predecessor experienced a net loss of $180.9 million, which when combined with a substantial amount of indebtedness caused our Predecessor to struggle with paying its debts as they came due. As a result, our Predecessor's independent registered public accounting firm included a paragraph in its audit opinion for the year ended December 31, 2017 casting doubt on our Predecessor's ability to continue as a going concern. During 2018, our Predecessor agreed with certain of its creditors to engage in a deleveraging transaction, which resulted in the Restructuring as described further below. On December 12, 2018, our Predecessor entered into the Restructuring Agreement. Substantially concurrent with the execution and delivery of, and pursuant to, the Restructuring Agreement, on December 12, 2018, Predecessor consummated a number of transactions contemplated thereby, which satisfied Predecessor's obligation to execute a Deleveraging Transaction as required under the Victory Park Revolver and the SPV Indenture. The Deleveraging Transaction was effected by way of an out-of-court strict foreclosure transaction, pursuant to which the Collateral Agent under the Existing Indentures were, acting at the direction of 52 Table of Contents certain beneficial holders holding more than 50% of the 2019 Notes and the beneficial holders of 100% of the 2020 Notes, exercised remedies whereby all right, title and interest in and to all of the assets of the Company that constituted collateral with respect to the Existing Indentures, including the issued and outstanding equity interests in certain of the Company's direct subsidiaries, were transferred to CCF OpCo. CCF OpCo is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Class A Common Units and Class B Common Units (which Class B Common Units represented 15.0% of the aggregate number of the issued and outstanding Common Units on December 12, 2018, subject to adjustment for any future issuances of common units (i) in consideration for the redemption of the PIK Notes ("Redemption Units"), or (ii) in connection with the issuance of any additional debt securities ("Additional Financing Units"), such that they continue to represent 15.0% of the issued and outstanding Common Units (including such Redemption Units and Additional Financing Units, but subject to dilution from any new management equity plan)) will entitle the holders thereof to voting rights (in each case, subject to the limitations in the governing documents of the Company). Following the Class C Distribution Time (as defined under "Description of Equity Securities"), Class C Common Units will be entitled to up to 5.0% of distributions from the Company. The Class C Common Units shall be subject to dilution from any new management equity plan and other common units and other equity interests of the Company that may be issued after the effective date of the Deleveraging. Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations Acquisition and Disposition of Businesses On February 1, 2016, Buckeye Check Cashing of Florida Inc. ("BCC Florida"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Predecessor, completed the sale of the membership interests of Buckeye Check Cashing of Florida II LLC ("Florida II") to Buckeye Check Cashing of Florida III, LLC ("Buyer"). Florida II operated forty-three stores in the south Florida market at the transaction date and was part of the Retail financial service operating segment. In connection with the sale, Predecessor had provided the Buyer with a short-term $6.0 million line of credit, substantially all of which was drawn by the Buyer as part of, or concurrent with, the sale. As a result of uncertainties associated with repayment of the line of credit, Predecessor also recognized a $3.0 million loan loss reserve that has been included in the loss on sale of Florida II. On May 18, 2016, BCC Florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Predecessor, acquired five south Florida retail locations, previously owned by Florida II, from the subsequent purchaser of Florida II. BCC Florida agreed to accept the assets of the five retail locations in exchange for satisfying the Buyer's remaining obligation on the line of credit, net of loan loss reserve, from the sale of Florida II. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $0.3 million during the second quarter of 2016 which is included in corporate expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. On July 1, 2016, Predecessor's indirect subsidiaries, Checksmart Financial Company, Cash Central of Mississippi, LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Alabama, LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Arizona, Inc., and Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc., entered into a swap transaction (the "transaction") with QC Holdings, Inc., and QC Financial Services, Inc. (collectively "QC"). As part of the transaction, Predecessor's subsidiaries acquired QC Financial Services of California, Inc., which operated sixty retail locations in California, and thirty-eight retail locations in Ohio, Mississippi, Arizona and Alabama from QC. These new stores were accounted for as an acquisition. Also as part of the transaction, Predecessor transferred to QC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Illinois LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Kansas LLC, Buckeye Title Loans of Kansas LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Missouri LLC, Buckeye Title Loans of Missouri LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Utah, Inc., and Buckeye Title Loans of 53 Table of Contents Utah LLC, and the thirty-three retail locations operated by these entities. We refer to the transaction as the QC Transaction. The strategy surrounding the acquisition was to acquire new customers and consolidate stores which represented a service area overlap with our legacy stores. Thirty of the acquired ninety-eight stores remained open as of December 31, 2018. Other than the transfer of the equity interests and assets, the transaction did not provide for the payment or receipt of any other consideration by Predecessor's subsidiaries or by QC, other than customary post-closing adjustments. In entering into the transaction, Predecessor's subsidiaries and QC each concluded that the net value of the equity interests and other assets received by QC are substantially equal to the net value of the equity interests and other assets received by Predecessor's subsidiaries. On December 22, 2016, Buckeye Check Cashing of Mississippi, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Predecessor, acquired the assets of seventeen Mississippi retail store locations for $1.4 million, and assumed the leases of forty-two retail locations in June 2017. The strategy surrounding the transactions was to acquire new customers and consolidate stores which represented a service area overlap. Forty-five of these fifty-nine stores remained open as of December 31, 2018. Retail Platform During the year ended December 31, 2018, we opened no retail locations and closed eighteen retail locations. The chart below sets forth certain information regarding our retail presence and number of states served via the internet as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, 2018, respectively.

Changes in Legislation & Regulation The CFPB Arbitration Rule On July 10, 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") adopted the final rule prohibiting the use of mandatory arbitration clauses with class action waivers in consumer financial services contracts, or the Anti-Arbitration Rule. The Anti-Arbitration Rule was published in the Federal Register on July 19, 2017, and overturned by Congress on October 24, 2017, based on the Congressional Review Act. On November 1, 2017, President Trump signed Congress's resolution repealing the CFPB's Anti-Arbitration Rule, officially invalidating the rule. As a result of the Anti-Arbitration Rule having been disapproved under the Congressional Review Act, the CFPB is prevented from reissuing the disapproved rule in substantially the same form or from issuing a new rule that is substantially the same, unless the reissued or new rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of the resolution of disapproval. The CFPB Payday, Vehicle Title and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans Rules On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. Among other things, this act created the CFPB and granted it the authority to regulate companies that provide consumer financial services. The CFPB has examined both our retail and internet operations. The findings from these exams did not result in any material change to our business practices. We expect to be periodically examined in the future by the CFPB as well as other regulatory agencies. On June 2, 2016, the CFPB released its proposed rules addressing payday, vehicle title and certain high-cost installment loans. The CFPB accepted comments on the proposed rules through October 7, 2016. On October 4, 2017, the CFPB released its final rule applicable to payday, title and certain high-cost installment loans ("CFPB Rule"). The CFPB Rule was published in the Federal Register on November 17, 2017, and but for the CFPB's February 6, 2019, proposal to rescind a portion of those 55 Table of Contents rules, would have become fully effective on August 2019. Further, it is possible that some or all of the CFPB Rule will be subject to legal challenge by trade groups or other private parties. The portion of the CFPB Rule that the February 6, 2019, proposal seeks to rescind involves the ability-to-repay, or ATR, requirements for "covered short-term loans" and "covered longer-term balloon-payment loans," as well as payment limitations on these loans and "covered longer-term loans." Covered short-term loans are consumer loans with a term of 45 days or less. Covered longer-term balloon payment loans include consumer loans with a term of more than 45 days where (i) the loan is payable in a single payment, (ii) any payment is more than twice any other payment, or (iii) the loan is a multiple advance loan that may not fully amortize by a specified date and the final payment could be more than twice the amount of other minimum payments. Covered longer-term loans are consumer loans with a term of more than 45 days where (i) the total cost of credit exceeds an annual rate of 36%, and (ii) the lender obtains a form of "leveraged payment mechanism" giving the lender a right to initiate transfers from the consumer's account. Post-dated checks, authorizations to initiate automated clearing house or ACH payments and authorizations to initiate prepaid or debit card payments are all leveraged payment mechanisms under the CFPB Rule. The February 6, 2019, proposal seeks also to rescind the requirement that a lender choose between the following two options: A "full payment test," under which the lender must make a reasonable determination of the consumer's ability to repay the loan in full and cover major financial obligations and living expenses over the term of the loan and the succeeding 30 days. Under this test, the lender must take account of the consumer's basic living expenses and obtain and generally verify evidence of the consumer's income and major financial obligations. However, in circumstances where a lender determines that a reliable income record is not reasonably available, such as when a consumer receives and spends income in cash, the lender may reasonably rely on the consumer's statements alone as evidence of income. Further, unless a housing debt obligation appears on a national consumer report, the lender may reasonably rely on the consumer's written statement regarding his or her housing expense. As part of the ATR determination, the CFPB Rule permits lenders and consumers in certain circumstances to rely on income from third parties, such as spouses, to which the consumer has a reasonable expectation of access, and to consider whether another person is regularly contributing to the payment of major financial obligations or basic living expenses. A 30-day cooling off period applies after a sequence of three covered short-term or longer-term balloon payment loans. A "principal-payoff option," under which the lender may make up to three sequential loans, or so-called Section 1041.6 Loans, without engaging in an ATR analysis. The first Section 1041.6 Loan in any sequence of Section 1041.6 Loans without a 30-day cooling off period between loans is limited to $500, the second is limited to a principal amount that is at least one-third smaller than the principal amount of the first, and the third is limited to a principal amount that is at least two-thirds smaller than the principal amount of the first. A lender may not use this option if (i) the consumer had in the past 30 days an outstanding covered short-term loan or an outstanding longer-term balloon payment loan that is not a Section 1041.6 Loan, or (ii) the new Section 1041.6 Loan would result in the consumer having more than six covered short-term loans (including Section 1041.6 Loans) during a consecutive 12-month period or being in debt for more than 90 days on such loans during a consecutive 12-month period. For Section 1041.6 Loans, the lender cannot take vehicle security or structure the loan as open-end credit. The portion of the CFPB Rule's addressing the "penalty fee prevention" provisions, will, under the current proposal, become effective on August 19, 2019. Under these provisions: If two consecutive attempts to collect money from a particular account of the borrower, made through any channel (e.g., paper check, ACH, prepaid card) are unsuccessful due to insufficient funds, the lender cannot make any further attempts to collect from such account unless and until the lender 56 Table of Contents has provided a new notice to the borrower and the borrower has provided a new and specific authorization for additional payment transfers. The CFPB Rule contains specific requirements and conditions for the authorization. While the CFPB has explained that these provisions are designed to limit bank penalty fees to which consumers may be subject, and while banks do not charge penalty fees on card authorization requests, the CFPB Rule nevertheless treats card authorization requests as payment attempts subject to these limitations. A lender generally must give the consumer at least three business days' advance notice before attempting to collect payment by accessing a consumer's checking, savings, or prepaid account. The notice must include information such as the date of the payment request, payment channel and payment amount (broken down by principal, interest, fees, and other charges), as well as additional information for "unusual attempts," such as when the payment is for a different amount than the regular payment, initiated on a date other than the date of a regularly scheduled payment or initiated in a different channel than the immediately preceding payment attempt. Other Legislative and Regulatory Changes The CFPB has announced tentative plans to propose rules affecting debt collection, debt accuracy and verification. Also, during the past few years, legislation, ballot initiatives and regulations have been proposed or adopted in various states that would prohibit or severely restrict our short-term consumer lending. For a discussion of the potential impact of the CFPB Rule on the Company, see "Risk FactorsThe CFPB has adopted rules applicable to our loans that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, on our ability to offer short-term consumer loans, on our ability to obtain ACH payment authorizations, or on our credit facility." Product Characteristics and Mix As the Company expands its product offerings to meet customers' needs, the characteristics of the Company's overall loan portfolio shift to reflect the terms of these new products. Our various lending products have different terms. Our prepaid debit card direct deposit offering may reduce our check cashing fees; however, the availability of direct deposit to the Insight prepaid card as an alternative to check cashing may extend the customer relationship. Expenses Our operating expenses relate primarily to the operation of our retail locations and internet presence, including salaries and benefits, retail location occupancy costs, call center costs, advertising, loan loss provisions, and depreciation of assets. We also incur corporate and other expenses on a company-wide basis, including interest expense and other financing costs related to our indebtedness, insurance, salaries, benefits, occupancy costs, professional expenses and management fees paid to our Predecessor's largest stockholders. We view our compliance, collections and operations groups as core competencies. We have invested in each of these areas and believe we will benefit from increased economies of scale and satisfy the increased regulatory scrutiny. Closure of the Utah Facility In February 2017, the Predecessor closed the Utah office that was acquired in 2012 when we purchased Direct Financial Solutions, our internet business. All call center operations have been fully integrated into our primary headquarters in Dublin, Ohio. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred $2.6 million in closure costs consisting of $1.8 million in lease termination expenses and 57 Table of Contents $0.8 million in loss on disposal of assets associated with this consolidation. In November 2017, Predecessor settled with the landlord, resulting in a $0.6 million reduction of the lease termination expense. Critical Accounting Policies Consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, our management makes certain estimates and assumptions to determine the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in the process of preparing our financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available to management at the time the estimates or assumptions are made. The most significant estimates made by our management include allowance for loan losses, stock based compensation, and our determination for recording the amount of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, because these estimates and assumptions could change materially as a result of conditions both within and beyond management's control. Management believes that among our significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment: Finance Receivables, Net Finance receivables consist of short-term and medium-term consumer loans. Short-term consumer loans can be unsecured or secured with a maturity up to ninety days. Unsecured short-term products typically range in size from $100 to $1,000, with a maturity between fourteen and thirty days, and an agreement to defer the presentment of the customer's personal check or preauthorized debit for the aggregate amount of the advance plus fees. This form of lending is based on applicable laws and regulations which vary by state. Statutes vary from state-to-state permitting charging fees of 15% to 20%, to charging interest at 25% per annum plus origination fees. The customers repay the cash advances by making cash payments or allowing the check or preauthorized debit to be presented. Secured short-term products typically range from $750 to $5,000, and are asset-based consumer loans whereby the customer obtains cash and grants a security interest in the collateral that may become a lien against that collateral. Secured consumer loans represented 18.2%, 14.5% and 12.8% of short-term consumer loans at December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Medium-term consumer loans can be unsecured or secured with a maturity of three months up to thirty-six months. Unsecured medium-term products typically range from $100 to $5,000. These consumer loans vary in structure depending upon the regulatory environment where they are offered. The consumer loans are due in installments or provide for a line of credit with periodic monthly payments. Secured medium-term products, typically range from $750 to $5,000, and are asset-based consumer loans whereby the customer obtains cash and grants a security interest in the collateral that may become a lien against that collateral. Secured consumer loans represented 10.2%, 12.6% and 13.7% of medium-term consumer loans at December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. In some instances, we maintain debt-purchasing arrangements with third-party lenders. We accrue for these obligations through management's estimation of anticipated purchases based on expected losses in the third-party lender's portfolio. This obligation is recorded as a current liability on our balance sheet. Total finance receivables, net of unearned advance fees and allowance for loan losses, on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 were $93.8 million, $94.3 million and $84.4 million, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 were $16.2 million, $16.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, the allowance for loan losses were 14.7%, 14.8% and 4.0%, respectively, of total finance receivables, net of unearned advance fees. 58 Table of Contents Finance receivables, net as of December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 are as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Finance Receivables, net of unearned advance fees $ 110,038 $ 110,666 $ 87,838 Less: Allowance for loan losses 16,219 16,327 3,474 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Finance Receivables, Net $ 93,819 $ 94,339 $ 84,364 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The total changes to the allowance for loan losses for the Predecessor years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, the Predecessor period ended December 12, 2018, and the Successor period ended December 31, 2018 are as follows (in thousands): For the Period January 1 Through December 12, 2018 Predecessor For the Period December 13 Through December 31, 2018 Successor Year Ended December 31, 2016 Predecessor 2017 Predecessor Allowance for loan losses Beginning of Period $ 23,892 $ 16,219 $ 16,327 $  Provisions for loan losses 84,742 97,569 67,827 1,979 Charge-offs, net (92,415 ) (97,461 ) (67,775 ) 1,495 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ End of Period $ 16,219 $ 16,327 $ 16,379 $ 3,474 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Allowance as a percentage of finance receivables, net of unearned advance fees 14.7 % 14.8 % 16.7 % 4.0 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The provision for loan losses for the Predecessor years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and the Predecessor period ended December 12, 2018 includes losses from returned items from check cashing of $6.1 million, $6.0 million, and $5.0 million and third party lender losses of $25.2 million, $32.7 million, and $24.3 million, respectively. The provision for loan losses for the Successor period ended December 31, 2018 includes losses from returned items from check cashing of $0.2 million and third party lender losses of $0.9 million. In some instances the Company guarantees loans with third-party lenders. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding amount of active consumer loans were $34.1 million and $37.0 million, respectively, consisting of $33.8 million and $35.8 million in short-term, and $0.3 million and $1.2 million in installment loans, respectively. We accrue for these obligations through management's estimation of anticipated purchases based on expected losses in the third-party lender's portfolio. This obligation is recorded as a current liability on our balance sheet and was $4.5 million and $4.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net charge-offs for the Successor period ended December 31, 2018 includes recoveries from the Predecessor period as the allowance for loan losses was reset due to purchase accounting. Goodwill Impairment Management evaluates all long-lived assets for impairment annually as of December 31, or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate an asset might be impaired, including goodwill and equity method investments. One event that requires that we perform a goodwill impairment test is when a portion of the retail reporting unit is sold. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets at the date of the acquisition. 59 Table of Contents One of the methods that management employs in the review of such assets uses estimates of future cash flows. If the carrying value is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Management believes that its estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable. Changes in estimates of such cash flows and fair value, however, could impact the estimated value of such assets. Predecessor divested its interests in Florida II in February 2016, as described in Note 14 of Predecessor's audited financial statements. At this time, the test resulted in no impairment of goodwill. On July 1, 2016, Predecessor entered into a swap transaction and transferred its interests in Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, and Utah as described in Note 14. The test concluded that the Retail financial services reporting unit was impaired by $28.9 million as of July 1, 2016 as described in Note 5 of Predecessor's audited financial statements. Predecessor conducted its annual test for impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 for the Retail financial services reporting unit and concluded that the Retail financial services reporting unit had an impairment of $-0- million, and $113.8 million, respectively. Predecessor's goodwill was fully impaired as of December 31, 2017. Income Taxes We record income taxes under generally accepted accounting principles. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2016, Predecessor recorded a full valuation allowance on its existing deferred tax assets as their future utilization was uncertain at that time. Our Predecessor continues to maintain a full valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2018, we maintained a full valuation allowance on our existing deferred tax assets as it is not more likely than not that approximately $52.8 million of net deferred tax assets would be realized. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted comprehensive tax legislation (the "Tax Act"), which significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, lowering the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The lower U.S. corporate income tax rate is effective January 1, 2018, however the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities were adjusted in 2017 when the new tax law was enacted. The estimated impact of the Tax Act is further described in the notes to Predecessor's audited financial statements. 60 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth key operating data for our operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018 (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2016 Revenue % 2017 Revenue % 2018 Revenue % Total Revenues $ 402,329 100.0 % $ 364,067 100.0 % $ 346,238 100.0 % Operating Expenses Salaries 70,024 17.4 % 70,539 19.4 % 68,972 19.9 % Provision for losses 115,962 28.8 % 136,201 37.4 % 100,211 28.9 % Occupancy 27,590 6.9 % 27,197 7.5 % 25,996 7.5 % Advertising and marketing 6,831 1.7 % 7,262 2.0 % 4,738 1.4 % Lease termination 1,733 0.4 % 1,857 0.5 % 754 0.2 % Depreciation and amortization 10,116 2.5 % 9,461 2.6 % 8,029 2.3 % Other operating expenses 51,597 12.8 % 51,738 14.3 % 42,718 12.4 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Operating Expenses 283,853 70.6 % 304,255 83.6 % 251,418 72.6 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Income from Operations 118,476 29.4 % 59,812 16.4 % 94,820 27.4 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Corporate and other expenses Corporate expenses 85,673 21.3 % 81,560 22.4 % 68,006 19.6 % Transaction expenses     6,941 2.0 % Lease termination   1,226 0.3 %   Depreciation and amortization 4,987 1.2 % 4,929 1.4 % 5,185 1.5 % Interest expense, net 44,470 11.1 % 48,245 13.3 % 53,174 15.4 % Loss on sale of subsidiaries 4,106 1.0 %     (Gain) loss on debt extinguishment (65,117 ) (16.2 )%   10,832 3.1 % Goodwill impairment 28,949 7.2 % 113,753 31.2 %   Income tax expense (benefit) 16,192 4.0 % (9,621 ) (2.6 )% 41 0.0 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total corporate and other expenses 119,260 29.6 % 240,092 65.9 % 144,179 41.6 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net loss before advisory fee (784 ) (0.2 )% (180,280 ) (49.5 )% (49,359 ) (14.3 )% Sponsor advisory fee 761 0.2 % 615 0.2 % 300 0.1 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net loss before advisory fee $ (1,545 ) (0.4 )% $ (180,895 ) (49.7 )% $ (49,659 ) (14.3 )% ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 61 Table of Contents The following tables set forth key loan and check cashing operating data for our operations as of and for the total years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Short-term Loan Operating Data (unaudited): Loan volume (originations and refinancing) (in thousands) $ 1,065,716 $ 1,036,753 $ 1,058,854 Number of loan transactions (in thousands) 2,938 2,858 2,906 Average new loan size $ 363 $ 363 $ 364 Average fee per new loan $ 48.49 $ 48.87 $ 47.34 Loan loss provision $ 37,906 $ 46,240 $ 39,192 Loan loss provision as a percentage of loan volume 3.6 % 4.5 % 3.7 % Secured loans as percentage of total at December 31st 18.2 % 14.5 % 12.8 % Medium-term Loan Operating Data (unaudited): Balance outstanding (in thousands) $ 51,431 $ 46,903 $ 41,248 Number of loans outstanding 42,128 37,371 44,582 Average balance outstanding $ 1,219 $ 1,255 $ 925 Weighted average monthly percentage rate 16.5 % 16.8 % 17.8 % Allowance as a percentage of finance receivables 27.2 % 29.1 % 30.9 % Loan loss provision $ 46,836 $ 51,329 $ 30,614 Secured loans as percentage of total at December 31st 10.2 % 12.6 % 13.7 % Check Cashing Data (unaudited): Face amount of checks cashed (in thousands) $ 2,072,593 $ 1,829,036 $ 1,828,537 Number of checks cashed (in thousands) 3,979 3,301 3,039 Face amount of average check $ 521 $ 554 $ 602 Average fee per check $ 12.17 $ 13.94 $ 15.47 Returned check expense $ 6,056 $ 5,966 $ 5,200 Returned check expense as a percent of face amount of checks cashed 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.3 % Total Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Total Year Ended December 31, 2017 Revenue The following table sets forth revenue by product line and total revenue for the total years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

The increase in interest expense is due to the amortization of financing costs associated with the revolving credit facility and note amendments, and the increase in interest related to the issuance of secured and senior notes during 2018 as part of the Restructuring. Transaction expenses in 2018 are professional fees associated with the Restructuring. The loss on debt extinguishment in 2018 is the result of the termination fees paid to terminate the existing credit facility and cost of expensing unamortized deferred issuance costs. Lease termination costs in 2017 is the result of the closure of the Company's Utah facility. Goodwill impairment in 2017 was to write off the remaining value of goodwill based on an assessment of the fair value as of December 31, 2017 per an impairment analysis of the retail unit. The benefit from income tax expense in 2017 is due to the reversal of a deferred tax liability resulting from the goodwill impairment. 64 Table of Contents Business Segment Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 As of December 31, 2018 and for the Successor period from December 13 through December 31, 2018 Retail Financial Services % of Revenue Internet Financial Services % of Revenue Unallocated (Income) Expenses Consolidated % of Revenue Total Assets $ 212,772 $ 24,450 $ 237,222 Goodwill 11,288  11,288 Other Intangible Assets 2,921 215 3,136 Total Revenues $ 16,556 100.0 % $ 2,424 100.0 % $ 18,980 100.0 % Provision for Loan Losses 2,659 16.1 % 454 18.7 % 3,113 16.4 % Other Operating Expenses 7,151 43.2 % 190 7.8 % 7,341 38.6 % Operating Gross Profit 6,746 40.7 % 1,780 73.5 % 8,526 45.0 % Interest Expense, net 1,288 7.8 % 1,126 46.5 % 2,414 12.7 % Depreciation and Amortization 849 5.1 % 18 0.7 % 867 4.6 % Other Corporate Expenses(a)     3,607 3,607 19.0 % Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations, before tax 4,609 27.8 % 636 26.2 % (3,607 ) 1,638 8.6 % (a) Represents expenses that are not allocated between reportable segments.

Revenue from short-term consumer loan fees and interest for the Predecessor year ended December 31, 2017, decreased $3.1 million, or 2.2%, but grew sequentially each quarter as the Predecessor expanded its portfolios. Fourth quarter revenue of $39.0 million was an increase of $1.2 million, or 3.3%, over third quarter revenue, and an increase of $4.7 million, or 13.8%, over the prior year fourth quarter. Revenue from medium-term consumer loans for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased $19.0 million, or 19.9%, compared to the same period in 2016. Fourth quarter revenue of $22.2 million was an increase of $2.1 million, or 10.5%, over third quarter revenue, and an increase of $1.2 million, or 6.0%, over the prior year fourth quarter. The decrease in revenue from credit service fees, when comparing the current year to the prior year, occurred in the first half of the current year as the Predecessor began growing the CSO program. However, credit service fees had grown such that the third and fourth quarters of 2017 were nearly flat compared to the same periods in the prior year. Revenue from check cashing fees for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased $2.4 million, or 5.0%, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to the sale and divesture of retail locations in the prior year offset by growth in certain markets. Revenue from other income for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased $3.9 million, or 18.6%, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in collections-related fees. 67 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Predecessor Years Ended December 31, 2016 2017 Increase (Decrease) 2016 2017 (Percent) (Percent of Revenue) Salaries $ 70,024 $ 70,539 $ 515 0.7 % 17.4 % 19.4 % Provision for Loan Losses 115,962 136,201 20,239 17.5 % 28.8 % 37.4 % Occupancy 27,590 27,197 (393 ) (1.4 )% 6.9 % 7.5 % Depreciation & Amortization 10,116 9,461 (655 ) (6.5 )% 2.5 % 2.6 % Lease Termination Costs 1,733 1,857 124 7.2 % 0.4 % 0.5 % Advertising & Marketing 6,831 7,262 431 6.3 % 1.7 % 2.0 % Bank Charges(a) 9,416 7,371 (2,045 ) (21.7 )% 2.3 % 2.0 % Store Supplies 1,972 1,655 (317 ) (16.1 )% 0.5 % 0.5 % Collection Expenses 2,464 1,587 (877 ) (35.6 )% 0.6 % 0.4 % Telecommunications 8,226 7,569 (657 ) (8.0 )% 2.0 % 2.1 % Security 2,304 2,120 (184 ) (8.0 )% 0.7 % 0.6 % License & Other Taxes 1,635 1,744 109 6.7 % 0.5 % 0.5 % Loss on Asset Disposal 2,033 4,164 2,131 104.8 % 0.5 % 1.1 % Verification Processes 2,760 4,005 1,245 45.1 % 0.7 % 1.1 % Other Operating Expenses 20,787 21,523 736 3.5 % 5.2 % 5.9 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Operating Expenses $ 283,853 $ 304,255 $ 20,402 7.2 % 70.6 % 83.6 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total operating expenses increased $20.4 million, or 7.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a shift in emphasis to portfolio expansion resulting in a higher provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses increased $20.2 million, or 17.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is related to higher provisioning as a percentage of revenue as the Predecessor focused on expanding its portfolios via new customer acquisition. The Predecessor has tightened its underwriting and verification procedures in order to avoid higher provision for loan losses. Bank charges decreased by $2.0 million, or 21.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, primarily due to a decrease in transactional volume. Loss on asset disposal increased by $2.1 million, or 104.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, reflecting an increase in the number of underperforming retail location closures as compared to the prior year. Verification processes expense increased by $1.2 million, or 45.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, reflecting an increased focus on loan portfolio expansion and on underwriting. 68 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Expenses Predecessor Years Ended December 31, 2016 2017 Increase (Decrease) 2016 2017 (Percent) (Percent of Revenue) Corporate Expenses $ 85,673 $ 81,560 $ (4,113 ) (4.8 )% 21.3 % 22.4 % Depreciation & Amortization 4,987 4,929 (58 ) (1.2 )% 1.2 % 1.4 % Sponsor Advisory Fee 761 615 (146 ) (19.2 )% 0.2 % 0.2 % Interest expense, net 44,470 48,245 3,775 8.5 % 11.1 % 13.3 % Lease termination  1,226 1,226 100.0 % 0.0 % 0.3 % Loss on Sale of Subsidiaries 4,106  (4,106 ) 100.0 % 1.0 %  Gain on Debt Extinguishment (65,117 )  65,117 (100.0 )% (16.2 )%  Goodwill Impairment 28,949 113,753 84,804 292.9 % 7.2 % 31.2 % Income tax expense (benefit) 16,192 (9,621 ) (25,813 ) 159.4 % 4.0 % (2.6 )% ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Corporate and Other Expenses $ 120,021 $ 240,707 $ 120,686 100.6 % 29.8 % 66.1 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The decrease in corporate expenses from $85.7 million to $81.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year period, or a decrease of 4.8%, is primarily the result of our cost containment initiatives and the closure of the Utah facility. The $1.2 million increase in lease termination costs for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year period, is the result of the closure of the Predecessor's Utah facility. The $4.1 million loss on sale of subsidiaries in 2016 reflects the sale of the unrestricted subsidiary, Florida II, and the QC transaction both in that year, which was not repeated in 2017. The $65.1 million gain on debt extinguishment is the result of the Predecessor repurchasing $103.9 million of its outstanding senior secured notes during the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2017, the Predecessor shifted its resources to portfolio expansion and there were no repurchases of debt. Goodwill impairment increased by $84.8 million, or 292.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, after the Predecessor performed an impairment analysis of the retail unit and wrote off the remaining value of goodwill based on an assessment of the fair value as of December 31, 2017. Income tax expense (benefit) decreased by $25.8 million, or 159.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year due to the earnings and the valuation allowance taken against our deferred tax assets in the prior year as compared to the benefit in the current period due to the change in federal tax rate. 69 Table of Contents Business Segment Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 As of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 Retail Financial Services % of Revenue Internet Financial Services % of Revenue Unallocated (Income) Expenses Consolidated % of Revenue Total Assets $ 181,390 $ 31,016 $ 212,406 Other Intangible Assets 375 549 924 Total Revenues $ 291,655 100.0 % $ 72,412 100.0 % $ 364,067 100.0 % Provision for Loan Losses 83,499 28.6 % 52,702 72.8 % 136,201 37.4 % Other Operating Expenses 159,148 54.6 % 8,906 12.3 % 168,054 46.2 % Operating Gross Profit 49,008 16.8 % 10,804 14.9 % 59,812 16.4 % Interest Expense, net 33,403 11.5 % 14,842 20.5 % 48,245 13.3 % Depreciation and Amortization 4,477 1.5 % 452 0.6 % 4,929 1.5 % Lease Termination   1,226 1.7 % 1,226 0.3 % Goodwill Impairment 113,753 39.0 %   113,753 31.2 % Other Corporate Expenses(a)     82,175 82,175 22.6 % Loss from Continuing Operations, before tax (102,625 ) (35.2 )% (5,716 ) (7.9 )% (82,175 ) (190,516 ) (52.3 )% (b) Represents expenses that are not allocated between reportable segments.

Retail 70 Table of Contents financial services fourth quarter revenue of $79.5 million was an increase of $1.8 million, or 2.3%, over third quarter revenue, and an increase of $3.6 million, or 4.8%, over the prior year fourth quarter. Internet Financial Services For the year ended December 31, 2017, total revenues contributed by our Internet financial services segment was $72.4 million, a decrease of $18.6 million, or 20.4%, over the prior period. Internet financial services revenue of $20.4 million for the fourth quarter was an increase of $1.6 million, or 8.5%, over the fourth quarter of the prior year. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically funded our liquidity needs through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and subsidiary notes. We believe that it is probable that cash flow from operations and available cash, together with availability of existing and future credit facilities, will be adequate to meet our obligations as they become due within the next twelve months. Beyond that twelve month period, funding capital expenditures, working capital and debt requirements will depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to many economic, commercial, regulatory, financial and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, these factors may require us to pursue restructuring of our indebtedness and/or alternative sources of capital such as asset-specific financing, incurrence of additional indebtedness, or asset sales. Full-Year Cash Flow Analysis The table below summarizes our cash flows for each of the years specified below: Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) Predecessor 2016 Predecessor 2017 Predecessor 2018 Successor 2018 Total 2018 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 121,776 $ 85,961 $ 75,566 $ 14,854 $ 90,420 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities (93,399 ) (145,825 ) (90,412 ) (6,093 ) (96,505 ) Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities (21,430 ) 21,728 (8,426 ) 682 (7,744 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash $ 6,947 $ (38,136 ) $ (23,272 ) $ 9,443 $ (13,829 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $90.4 million, $86.0 million and $121.8 million, respectively. Net income, net of the non-cash impact of goodwill impairment and the provision for loan losses was $50.6 million, $69.1 million, and $143.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively Cash Flows from Investing Activities: The $49.3 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, is primarily due to a $45.8 million decrease in loan originations primarily due to the implementation of stricter underwriting criteria. The $52.4 million increase in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, is primarily due to a $53.8 million increase in loan originations primarily due to a focus on new customer acquisition. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. The $29.5 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018, is primarily due to a $10.0 million decrease in 71 Table of Contents proceeds from subsidiary note, and a $19.2 million decrease in net proceeds on lines of credit, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The $43.2 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, is primarily due to the $38.8 million used to repurchase Senior secured notes during 2016. Capital Expenditures For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, we spent $9.1 million, $8.9 million, and $6.0 million, respectively, on capital expenditures. Capital expenditures during 2016 and 2017 were primarily to develop an analytical data warehouse to advance reporting and analytical capabilities to improve our risk management and operational decision making. Capital expenditures during 2018 were primarily for maintenance on certain retail locations. Seasonality Our business is seasonal based on the liquidity and cash flow needs of our customers. Customers cash tax refund checks primarily in the first calendar quarter of each year which is traditionally our strongest check cashing quarter. We typically see our loan portfolio decline in the first quarter as a result of the consumer liquidity created through income tax refunds. Following the first quarter, we typically see our loan portfolio expand through the remainder of the year with the third and fourth quarters showing the strongest loan demand due to the holiday season. Impact of Inflation Our results of operations are not materially impacted by fluctuations in inflation. Balance Sheet Variations Cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, money orders payable and revolving advances vary because of seasonal and day-to-day requirements resulting primarily from maintaining cash for cashing checks and making loans, and the receipt and remittance of cash from the sale of prepaid debit cards, wire transfers, money orders and the processing of bill payments. Loan Portfolio As of December 31, 2018, we are licensed to offer loans in 32 states. We have established a loan loss allowance in respect of our loans receivable at a level that our management believes to be adequate to absorb known or probable losses from loans made by us and accruals for losses in respect of loans made by third parties that we guarantee. Our policy for determining the loan loss allowance is based on historical experience, as well as our management's review and analysis of the payment and collection of the loans within prior periods. All loans and services, regardless of type, are made in accordance with state regulations, and, therefore, the terms of the loans and services may vary from state to state. Loan fees and interest are earned on loans. Products which allow for an upfront fee are recognized over the loan term. Other products' interest is earned over the term of the loan. As of December 31, 2017 and 2018, our total finance receivables net of unearned advance fees were approximately $110.7 million and $87.8 million, respectively. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In certain markets, we arrange for consumers to obtain consumer loan products from one of several independent third-party lenders whereby we act as a facilitator. For consumer loan products originated by third-party lenders under the programs, each lender is responsible for providing the 72 Table of Contents criteria by which the consumer's application is underwritten and, if approved, determining the amount of the consumer loan. The Company in turn is responsible for assessing whether or not the Company will guarantee such loans. When a consumer executes an agreement with the Company under these programs, the Company agrees, for a fee payable to the Company by the consumer, to provide certain services to the consumer, one of which is to guarantee the consumer's obligation to repay the loan received by the consumer from the third-party lender if the consumer fails to do so. The guarantee represents an obligation to purchase specific loans that default. As of December 31. 2018, and December 31, 2017, the outstanding amount of active consumer loans guaranteed by the Company was $34.1 million and $37.0 million, respectively. The outstanding amount of active consumer loans for Ohio consist of $30.5 million and $31.3 million in short-term and $0.3 million and $1.2 million in medium-term loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The outstanding amount of active consumer loans for Texas consist of $3.3 million and $4.5 million in short-term loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The accrual for third-party loan losses, which represents the estimated fair value of the liability for estimated losses on consumer loans guaranteed by the Company and the Predecessor were $4.5 million and $4.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. QUANTATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of December 31, 2018, we have no material market risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading or other purposes, as defined by GAAP. Interest rate risk The cash and cash equivalents reflected on our balance sheet represent largely uninvested cash in our branches and cash-in-transit. The amount of interest income we earn on these funds will decline with a decline in interest rates. However, due to the short-term nature of short-term investment grade securities and money market accounts, an immediate decline in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of December 31, 2018, we had $390.8 million of gross indebtedness, none of which is subject to variable interest rates. However, we may enter into variable rate indebtedness in the future. For more information about our outstanding indebtedness, see Note 6 to the accompanying audited financial statements.

We were formed in 2018 and continued, without interruption, the operations of our Predecessor. As a result of the Restructuring, we succeeded to the business and operations of our Predecessor. We provide our customers a variety of financial products and services, including short-term and medium-term consumer loans, check cashing, prepaid debit cards, and other services that address the specific needs of our customers. Through our customer focused business model, we provide our customers immediate access to financial services through our retail locations and our website. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 471 retail locations across 12 states and were licensed to deliver similar financial services over the internet in 29 states. Our retail business model provides a broad array of financial products and services whether through a retail location or over the internet, whichever distribution channel satisfies the target customer's needs. We want to achieve a superior level of customer satisfaction, resulting in increased market penetration and value creation. An important part of our retail model is investing in and creating a premier brand presence, supported by a well-trained and motivated workforce with the aim of enhancing the customer's experience, generating increased traffic and introducing our customers to our diversified set of products. Our Customers We serve a large and growing demographic group of customers by providing services to help them manage their day-to-day financial needs. Our customers are primarily working-class, middle-income individuals. Our customers generally are underserved or unserved by the traditional banking system and choose alternative solutions to gain convenient and immediate access to cash, consumer loans, prepaid debit cards, money transfers, bill payments, insurance, and money orders. We believe that our customers use our financial services because they are quick, convenient and, in many instances, more affordable than available alternatives. Additionally, we provide them with a safe, welcoming environment to use our services. 74 Table of Contents Locations and Operations The following map illustrates the geography of our licensed operations as of December 31, 2018. We typically locate our stores in highly visible and accessible locations, such as shopping centers and free standing buildings in high-traffic shopping areas. Other nearby retailers are typically grocery stores, restaurants, drug stores and discount stores. While we have owned stores in the past, all of our stores are currently leased. We currently operate stores under the following brands:  CheckSmart;  California Check Cashing Stores;  Cash 1 (pursuant to a license agreement);  Cash & Go;  First Virginia;  Community Choice Financial; and  Easy Money.

Products and Services We offer several convenient, fee-based services to meet the needs of our customers, including short-term and medium-term consumer loans, check cashing, prepaid debit cards, money transfers, bill payments, money orders, international and domestic prepaid phone cards, tax preparation, auto insurance, motor vehicle registration services and other ancillary retail financial services. Our business is seasonal based on the liquidity and cash flow needs of our customers. Consumer Loans. We offer a variety of consumer loan products and services which we believe our customers find to be convenient, transparent and lower-cost alternatives to other, more expensive options, such as incurring returned item fees, credit card late fees, overdraft or overdraft protection fees, utility late payments, disconnect and reconnect fees and other charges imposed by other financing sources when they do not have sufficient funds to cover unexpected expenses or other needs. Our customers often have limited access to more traditional sources of consumer credit, such as credit cards. The specific consumer loan products we offer vary by location, but generally include the following types of consumer loans:  Short-Term Consumer Loans. Short-term consumer loans can be unsecured or secured with a maturity up to ninety days. Unsecured short-term products are consumer loans that typically range in size from $100 to $1,000, the amount of the loan offered is typically dictated by state law and differs from state to state. We use proprietary underwriting criteria to determine the appropriate loan offer for an individual customer, which loan amount will never be less than the minimum or exceed the maximum allowed by state law. A short-term loan customer receives cash proceeds, typically in exchange for a post-dated personal check or a pre-authorized debit from his or her bank account. We offer this product over the internet and in 355 of our 471 stores. We, as the lender, agree to defer deposit of the check or initiation of the debit from the customer's bank account until the mutually agreed upon due date, which typically falls near the customer's next payday. Principal amounts of our short-term consumer loans averaged approximately $364 during 2018. Fees charged vary from state to state, generally ranging from $8 to $18 per $100 borrowed. Secured short-term products are asset-based loans whereby the customer obtains cash and grants a security interest in collateral, such as a check or a motor 76 Table of Contents vehicle title, which may be perfected as a lien on the collateral. Secured loans with a maturity of 90 days or less represented 12.8% of short-term consumer loans at December 31, 2018.  Medium-Term Consumer Loans. In meeting our customers' financial needs, we also offer unsecured and secured medium-term consumer loans. Principal amounts of unsecured medium-term products typically range from $100 to $5,000. The principal amount offered to the customer is determined by state law, which differs from state to state, and the amount for which the individual customer qualified based on that customer's financial circumstances. These loans have maturities between three months and 36 months. These consumer loans vary in their structure in order to conform to the specific regulatory requirements of the various jurisdictions in which they are offered. The consumer loans may have an installment repayment plan or provide for a line of credit with periodic monthly payments. We offer these consumer loans over the internet and in 315 of our 471 stores. Secured medium-term products typically range from $750 to $5,000 and are asset-based consumer loans whereby the customer obtains cash and grants a security interest in collateral, such as a motor vehicle title, which may be perfected as a lien on collateral. Secured consumer loans with a maturity greater than 90 days represented 13.7% of medium-term consumer loans at December 31, 2018. Our consumer loan products are authorized by statute or rule in the various states in which we offer them and are subject to extensive regulation. The scope of that regulation, including the terms on which consumer loans may be made, varies by jurisdiction. The states in which we offer consumer loan products generally regulate the maximum allowable fees and other charges to consumers and the maximum amount of the consumer loan, maturity and renewal or extension terms of these consumer loans. Some of the states in which we operate impose limits on the number of consumer loans a customer may have outstanding or on the amount of time that must pass between consumer loans. To comply with the laws and regulations of the states in which consumer loan products are offered, the terms of our consumer loan products must vary from state to state. As of December 31, 2018, our gross receivables for short-term and medium-term consumer loans were $89.8 million. We analyze the loan loss provision and our loan loss allowance in order to determine whether our estimates of such allowance are adequate for each of our consumer loan products. Our analysis is based on our understanding of our past loan loss experience, current economic conditions, volume and growth of our consumer loan portfolios, timing of maturity, as well as collections experience. Consumer loan products, including short-term and medium-term consumer loans, accounted for 59.3% and 57.8% of the Predecessor's and the Company's revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Credit Service Fees. The Company offers a fee-based credit service program ("CSO Program") to assist consumers in obtaining credit in certain markets through limited agency agreements with unaffiliated third-party lenders. The agreements govern the terms by which the Company refers customers to that lender, on a non-exclusive basis, for a possible extension of credit, processes loan applications and commits to reimburse the lender for any loans or related fees that were not collected from such customers. Credit service fees averaged $245.63 per CSO loan for the year ended December 31, 2018. Credit service fees accounted for 21.1% and 21.9%, respectively, of the Predecessor's and the Company's revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Check Cashing. We offer check cashing services in 469 of our 471 stores. Prior to cashing a check, our customer service representatives verify the customer's identification and enter the payee's tax identification number and the payer's bank account information in our internal, proprietary databases, which match these fields to prior transactions in order to mitigate our risk of loss. Subject to 77 Table of Contents appropriate approvals, we accept all forms of checks, including payroll, government, tax refund, insurance, money order, cashiers' and personal checks. Our check cashing fees averaged $15.47 per check for the year ended December 31, 2018, but vary depending upon the amount and type of check cashed, applicable state regulations and local market conditions. Check cashing accounted for 12.6% and 13.6%, respectively, of the Predecessor's and the Company's revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Prepaid Debit Card Services. We offer access to reloadable prepaid debit cards that provide our customers with a convenient and secure method of accessing their funds in a manner that meets their individual needs. The cards are provided by Insight Card Services LLC, or Insight, and our stores serve as distribution points where customers can purchase cards as well as load funds onto and withdraw funds from their cards. Customers can elect to receive check cashing proceeds on their cards without having to worry about security risks associated with carrying cash. The cards can be used where Visa® is accepted. These cards offer our customers the ability to direct deposit all or a portion of their payroll checks onto their cards, the benefit of an optional overdraft program, the ability to receive real-time wireless alerts for transactions and account balances, and the availability of in-store and online bill payment services. Prepaid debit card service fees averaged $11.09 per transaction for the year ended December 31, 2018. Prepaid debit card services accounted for 2.3% and 2.6%, respectively, of the Predecessor's and the Company's revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Other Products and Services. Introducing new products into our markets has historically created profitable revenue expansion. Other products and services offered through our stores include money transfer, bill payment, money orders, insurance, and, international and domestic prepaid phone cards. Additionally, in certain states we provide customers with access to tax preparation services. These other products and services provide revenues and help drive additional traffic to our stores, resulting in increased volume across all of our product offerings. Revenue from other products and services accounted for 4.7% and 4.1%, respectively, of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Advertising and Marketing Our marketing efforts are designed to promote our product and service offerings, create customer loyalty, introduce new customers to our brands and create cross-selling opportunities. In most of our markets, we utilize mass-media advertising including flyers, direct mail, outdoor advertising, internet advertising, including search engine optimization, and leads acquired from third party lead generation sources, yellow pages and radio and television advertising. We also utilize point-of-purchase materials in our retail locations and in-store marketing programs and promotions. Local marketing initiatives include sponsorship and participation in local events and charity functions to enhance brand awareness. Employees & Training As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,806 employees. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced any organized work stoppage, strike, or labor dispute. All employees are subject to a formal training program that varies based on department and role, and may include:  management training programs that cover employee hiring, discipline, retention, sexual harassment, workplace environment, ADA compliance, compensation, equal employment opportunity compliance and leadership; 78 Table of Contents  periodic regional training sessions that cover topics such as customer service, safety and security, better delivery of services and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and procedures, and store management strategies;  the on-going use of a web-based training tool to augment our on-the-job training, and effectively deliver and document our mandatory annual consumer compliance and anti-money laundering training and testing;  new hire training, which consists of online and on-the-job training for a period of time commensurate with the complexity of the position: and  opportunities to participate in other training events such as webinars, as appropriate for a given position. Our employees undergo a criminal background check, a process whereby we confirm that the social security number provided by the prospective employee matches the name of the employee, prior employment verification, and an interview process before employment. We maintain a compensation and career path program to provide employees with competitive pay rates and opportunities for advancement. We offer a complete and competitive benefits package to attract and retain employees. Technology & Information Systems We utilize centralized management information systems to support our customer service strategy and manage transaction risk, collections, internal controls, record keeping, compliance, and daily reporting functions. In retail store locations, our management system incorporates commercial, off-the-shelf point-of-sale (POS) systems customized to our specific requirements. Our POS systems are complemented by proprietary systems to enhance reporting and operational capabilities. Our retail POS systems are licensed in all stores and record and monitor the details of every transaction, including the service type, amount, fees, employee, date/time, and actions taken, which allows us to provide our services in a standardized and efficient manner in compliance with applicable regulations. Transaction data is recorded in our accounting system daily. We operate a wide area data communications network for our stores that has reduced customer waiting times, increased reliability and has allowed the implementation of new service enhancements. Each store runs Windows operating systems with a four to ten PC network that is connected to our corporate headquarters using a SD-WAN solution and industry leading security tools to protect our systems and customer data. Our corporate data center consists of devices supporting our management information system, configured for redundancy and high availability. Our primary data processing operations run in a cloud host environment with both locally diverse and geographically diverse locations. Data is replicated between the sites. This maximizes the availability of centralized systems, optimizes up-time for store operations, and eliminates our corporate office as a single point of failure in case of disaster. We maintain and test a comprehensive disaster recovery plan for all critical information systems. Our online lending operations are handled through proprietary and commercial software that gives the customer a consistent experience online. The software records lending transactions, handles customer reporting, and facilitates the analysis and management of our loan portfolio. The primary processing systems for our internet lending operations are in a cloud host environment with both locally diverse and geographically diverse locations. We have developed and continue to invest in an analytical data warehouse and advanced reporting and analytical capabilities continue to improve our risk management and operational decision making. 79 Table of Contents Collections Collection efforts are performed by our collections center, enabling maximum efficiency and ensuring the application of standardized procedures and controls. Collection practices comply with, as applicable, the stricter of federal or state regulations or industry best practices set forth by the trade associations of which we are members. Depending upon the product, initial collection efforts are coordinated between the internal collection division and the retail location originating the loans. As the receivable ages, collection responsibility shifts solely to the collections department. The collections department attempts to resolve the account by communicating with consumers via letters, email, texting and telephone calls. If recovery efforts prove unsuccessful, the obligation may be sent to a third-party collections agency, sold, or, with respect to secured loans, we may attempt repossession on the applicable collateral securing such loans. All recovery vendors undergo extensive initial and ongoing diligence and oversight. Security Employee safety is critical to us. Most of our retail store employees work behind bullet-resistant acrylic and reinforced partitions, and have security measures that include a time-delay equipped safe, an alarm system monitored by a third party, and personal panic buttons for each of our tellers. Many of our stores also have multi-camera DVR systems with remote access capability, teller area entry control, perimeter opening entry detection, and tracking of all employee movement in and out of secured areas. Training on security measures is an important part of our training program. Our business requires our stores to maintain a significant supply of cash. We are therefore subject to the risk of cash shortages resulting from employee and non-employee theft, as well as employee errors. Although we have implemented various programs to reduce these risks and provide security for our facilities and employees, these risks cannot be eliminated. From 2016 through 2018, the Predecessor's and the Company's annual uncollected cash shortages from employee errors and from theft were, in the aggregate, less than 0.28% of revenue. Our POS system allows management to detect cash shortages on a daily basis. In addition to other procedures, district managers and our internal monitoring staff conduct audits of each store's cash position and inventories on an unannounced and random basis. Professional armored carriers provide the daily transportation of currency for all of our stores. In addition, most stores electronically scan their check inventory to facilitate verification and record keeping. Competition The industry in which we operate is highly fragmented and very competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors in financial services are location or internet presence, customer service, fees and the transparency of fees, convenience, range of services offered, speed of service and confidentiality. With respect to our lending business, we compete with mono-line lending businesses, and multi-line alternative financial service providers, pawn shops, rent-to-own businesses, banks, credit unions, offshore lenders, lenders utilizing a Native American sovereign nation lending model, one-state model lenders, and state licensed lenders. With respect to our check cashing business, we compete with other check cashers and multi-line alternative financial service providers, grocery stores, convenience stores, banks, credit unions, and any other retailer that cashes checks, sells money orders, provides money transfer services or offers other similar financial services, including some big-box retailers. Some retailers cash checks without charging a fee under limited circumstances. Regulation and Compliance The products and services offered by the Company's indirect subsidiaries are subject to extensive state, federal and local regulation. The regulation of the consumer financial services industry is 80 Table of Contents intended primarily to protect consumers, detect illicit activity involving the use of cash, as well as provide operational guidelines to standardize business practices. State regulations commonly address allowable fees and charges related to consumer loan products, maximum loan duration and amounts, the number of simultaneous or consecutive loans, required waiting periods between loans, loan extensions and refinancings, required repayment plans for borrowers claiming inability to repay loans, security for loans and payment mechanisms, licensing, disclosures, reporting and documentation requirements, and in, certain jurisdictions, database reporting and loan utilization information. We are subject to federal and state regulations that require disclosure of the principal terms of each transaction to every customer, prohibit misleading advertising, protect against discriminatory practices, and prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices. Statutory and regulatory legal requirements are constantly changing as new laws and regulations are introduced and adopted, and existing laws and regulations are repealed, amended, modified and reinterpreted. We regularly work with authorities, both directly and through our active memberships in industry trade associations, to support our industry and to promote the development of laws and regulations that are equitable to businesses and consumers alike. We maintain legal and compliance departments to monitor new laws and regulations introduced at the federal, state, and local level and existing regulations as they are repealed, amended, and modified. We place a strong emphasis from the top down on the importance of compliance. This includes regular training programs for the Company's board of managers, compliance committee members, as well as all employees. We manage our compliance risk through three tiers of compliance oversight designed to address the risks of non-compliance and of consumer harm. The first tier is a board-level compliance committee which is chaired by the Company's chairman. This committee regularly receives reports from the second tier of compliance oversight, that being the board compliance committees of the Company's three principal operating subsidiaries. These subsidiary-level compliance committees are chaired by an independent member of the Company's board who is neither a member of management nor affiliated with any of the Company's equity holders. The subsidiary compliance committees are responsible for, among other things, overseeing compliance activities conducted within that subsidiary's operations, overseeing the execution of corrective action plans designed to remedy identified deficiencies, and approval of compliance-related policies and programs. The subsidiary compliance committees receive regular reports from the management compliance committees, which comprise the third tier of compliance oversight. The management compliance committees include high-level management employees who bring together knowledge from their respective areas of expertise and are responsible for reviewing various compliance reports, assessing compliance risks, implementing corrective action plans designed to continuously improve business processes, and review and referral of compliance-related policies and programs to the subsidiary-level compliance committees. In addition to the three levels of compliance risk oversight, we also have a compliance department that is responsible for the development, execution, and governance of our enterprise-wide compliance management system which includes elements of governance and compliance oversight; compliance control testing; and corrective action. The compliance department provides dedicated subject matter expertise and program development in risk areas such as consumer protection, privacy, data security, and anti-money laundering; and provides dedicated resources to support specific business and operational areas in designing compliance risk mitigation strategies. Within the compliance department, we also maintain an internal compliance monitoring function which evaluates adherence to compliance standards by the subsidiaries that conduct retail and internet operations and is inclusive of applicable federal and state laws and regulations as well as internal policies and procedures. The internal compliance monitoring process includes conducting periodic unannounced examinations of our subsidiaries' retail locations, reviewing customer files, reports, and compliance with specific federal and state legal and regulatory requirements. The internal compliance monitoring function also monitors customer-facing phone calls, emails and chat communications, to detect and assist management in addressing compliance risks inherent in those types of communications. 81 Table of Contents As part of the internal compliance monitoring program, results are reported to management to identify potential compliance issues and the need for further training. In addition, internal compliance monitoring results are also reported to the management-level compliance committee. The results of internal compliance monitoring and state examinations are reviewed and determinations are made whether to make changes to software systems, operations, or marketing. Detected deficiencies requiring an operational change are provided to the appropriate person to be implemented as soon as is practicable to ensure improved future compliance performance. We have allocated appropriate resources to proactively address regulation and compliance as we have grown and added new or modified products and services. U.S. Federal Regulations The U.S. federal government and its respective agencies possess significant regulatory authority over consumer financial services. The body of laws to which we are subject has a significant impact on our operations. Dodd-Frank: In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act. Title X of this legislation created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the name of which was subsequently changed to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection or CFPB. The CFPB became operational in July 2011. Title X grants the CFPB broad rule-making, supervisory and enforcement powers with regard to consumer financial services. Title X of Dodd-Frank also contains so-called "UDAAP" provisions declaring unlawful "unfair," "deceptive," and "abusive" acts and practices in connection with the delivery of consumer financial services and giving the CFPB the power to enforce UDAAP prohibitions and to adopt UDAAP rules defining unlawful acts and practices. Additionally, the FTC Act prohibits "unfair" and "deceptive" acts and practices and gives the FTC enforcement authority to prevent and redress violations of this prohibition. CFPB Rule: Relying on its authority to adopt UDAAP rules, the CFPB adopted new rules applicable to payday, title and certain high-cost installment loans, or the CFPB Rules. The CFPB Rules were published in the Federal Register on November 17, 2017, and mandated that lenders offering covered products comply with the CBFP Rules effective November 19, 2019 ("Compliance Date"). On October 26, 2018, the CFPB released a "Public Statement Regarding Payday Rule Reconsideration and Delay of Compliance Date," which stated: The Bureau expects to issue proposed rules in January 2019 that will reconsider the Bureau's rule regarding Payday, Vehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans and address the rule's compliance date. The Bureau will make final decisions regarding the scope of the proposal closer to the issuance of the proposed rules. However, the Bureau is currently planning to propose revisiting only the ability-to-repay provisions and not the payments provisions, in significant part because the ability-to-repay provisions have much greater consequences for both consumers and industry than the payment provisions. The proposals will be published as quickly as practicable consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable law. Notwithstanding the above-quoted public statement from the CFPB, in its current form, the CFPB Rule establishes ability-to-repay, or ATR, requirements for "covered short-term loans" and "covered longer-term balloon-payment loans," as well as payment limitations on these loans and "covered longer-term loans." Covered short-term loans are consumer loans with a term of 45 days or less. Covered longer-term balloon payment loans include consumer loans with a term of more than 45 days where (i) the loan is payable in a single payment, (ii) any payment is more than twice any other payment, or (iii) the loan is a multiple advance loan that may not fully amortize by a specified date and the final payment could be more than twice the amount of other minimum payments. Covered longer-term loans are consumer loans with a term of more than 45 days where (i) the total cost of credit exceeds an annual rate of 36%, and (ii) the lender obtains a form of "leveraged payment 82 Table of Contents mechanism" giving the lender a right to initiate transfers from the consumer's account. Post-dated checks, authorizations to initiate automated clearing house or ACH payments and authorizations to initiate prepaid or debit card payments, all of which we currently rely on in our business, are all leveraged payment mechanisms subject to the limitations in the CFPB Rule. The CFPB Rule excludes from coverage, among other loans: (1) purchase-money credit secured by the vehicle or other goods financed (but not unsecured purchase-money credit or credit that finances services as opposed to goods); (2) real property or dwelling-secured credit if the lien is recorded or perfected; (3) credit cards; (4) student loans; (5) non-recourse pawn loans; and (6) overdraft services and overdraft lines of credit. These exclusions do not apply to our loans. Under the provisions of the CFPB Rule applicable to covered short-term loans and covered longer-term balloon-payment loans, to make a conforming loan a lender will need to choose between the following two options.  A "full payment test," under which the lender must make a reasonable determination of the consumer's ability to repay the loan in full and cover major financial obligations and living expenses over the term of the loan and the succeeding 30 days. Under this test, the lender must take account of the consumer's basic living expenses and obtain and generally verify evidence of the consumer's income and major financial obligations. However, in circumstances where a lender determines that a reliable income record is not reasonably available, such as when a consumer receives and spends income in cash, the lender may reasonably rely on the consumer's statements alone as evidence of income. Further, unless a housing debt obligation appears on a national consumer report, the lender may reasonably rely on the consumer's written statement regarding his or her housing expense. As part of the ATR determination, the CFPB Rule permits lenders and consumers in certain circumstances to rely on income from third parties, such as spouses, to which the consumer has a reasonable expectation of access, and to consider whether another person is regularly contributing to the payment of major financial obligations or basic living expenses. A 30-day cooling off period applies after a sequence of three covered short-term or longer-term balloon payment loans.  A "principal-payoff option," under which the lender may make up to three sequential loans, or so-called Section 1041.6 Loans, without engaging in an ATR analysis. The first Section 1041.6 Loan in any sequence of Section 1041.6 Loans without a 30-day cooling off period between loans is limited to $500, the second is limited to a principal amount that is at least one-third smaller than the principal amount of the first, and the third is limited to a principal amount that is at least two-thirds smaller than the principal amount of the first. A lender may not use this option if (i) the consumer had in the past 30 days an outstanding covered short-term loan or an outstanding longer-term balloon payment loan that is not a Section 1041.6 Loan, or (ii) the new Section 1041.6 Loan would result in the consumer having more than six covered short-term loans (including Section 1041.6 Loans) during a consecutive 12-month period or being in debt for more than 90 days on such loans during a consecutive 12-month period. For Section 1041.6 Loans, the lender cannot take vehicle security or structure the loan as open-end credit. Covered longer-term loans that are not balloon loans will not be subject to the foregoing requirements. However, these loans will be subject to the CFPB Rule's "penalty fee prevention" provisions, which will apply to all covered loans. Under these provisions, if two consecutive attempts to collect money from a particular account of the borrower, made through any channel (e.g., paper check, ACH, prepaid card) are unsuccessful due to insufficient funds, the lender cannot make any further attempts to collect from such account unless and until the lender has provided a new notice to the borrower and the borrower has provided a new and specific authorization for additional payment transfers. The CFPB Rule contains specific requirements and conditions for the authorization. While the CFPB has explained that these provisions are designed to limit bank penalty fees to which 83 Table of Contents consumers may be subject, and while banks do not charge penalty fees on card authorization requests, the CFPB Rule nevertheless treats card authorization requests as payment attempts subject to these limitations. A lender generally must give the consumer at least three business days' advance notice before attempting to collect payment by accessing a consumer's checking, savings, or prepaid account. The notice must include information such as the date of the payment request, payment channel and payment amount (broken down by principal, interest, fees, and other charges), as well as additional information for "unusual attempts," such as when the payment is for a different amount than the regular payment, initiated on a date other than the date of a regularly scheduled payment or initiated in a different channel that the immediately preceding payment attempt. The CFPB Rule also requires the CFPB's registration of consumer reporting agencies as "registered information systems" to which lenders must furnish information about covered short-term and longer-term balloon loans and from which lenders must obtain consumer reports for use in extending such credit. If there is no registered information system or if no registered information system has been registered for at least 180 days, lenders will be unable to make Section 1041.6 Loans. In addition to the public statement quoted above, it is also possible that certain elements of the CFPB Rule will be subject to legal challenge by trade groups or other private parties. Thus, it is impossible to predict whether, when, and to what extent the CFPB Rule will go into effect or whether and how it might be modified. On February 6, 2019, the CFPB proposed to rescind certain provisions of the CFPB Rule, specifically to repeal the ATR requirement, which the Bureau now refers to as the "mandatory underwriting provisions," and to delay the compliance date for the mandatory underwriting provisions until November 19, 2020. CFPB Supervision and Examination: The CFPB has supervisory powers over many providers of consumer financial products and services, including explicit authority to examine (and require registration) of payday lenders. The CFPB released its Supervision and Examination Manual, which includes a section on Short-Term, Small-Dollar Lending Procedures, and began field examinations of industry participants, including examinations of some of our subsidiaries, in 2012. CFPB Enforcement: In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act's grant of rule-making authority, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of federal consumer financial laws (including Dodd-Frank's UDAAP provisions and the CFPB's own rules). In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief) and monetary penalties ranging from $5,000 per day for ordinary violations of federal consumer financial laws to $25,000 per day for reckless violations and $1 million per day for knowing violations. Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations promulgated thereunder (such as the CFPB Rule), the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the CFPB (and possibly also for the civil penalties available to the CFPB). Potentially, if the CFPB, the FTC or one or more state officials believe we have violated the foregoing laws, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that would have a material adverse effect on us. Other Consumer Lending Laws. Our consumer lending is subject to the federal Truth in Lending Act, or TILA, and its underlying regulations, known as Regulation Z, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. These laws require us to provide certain disclosures to prospective borrowers and protect against unfair credit practices. The principal disclosures required under TILA are intended to promote the informed use of consumer credit. Under TILA, when acting as a lender, we are required to disclose certain material terms related to a credit transaction, including, but not limited to, the 84 Table of Contents annual percentage rate, finance charge, amount financed, total of payments, the number and amount of payments and payment due dates to repay the indebtedness. The federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits us from discriminating against any credit applicant on the basis of any protected category, such as race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or age, and requires us to notify credit applicants of any action taken on the individual's credit application. Consumer Reports and Information. The use of consumer reports and other personal data used in credit underwriting is governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, and similar state laws governing the use of consumer credit information. The FCRA establishes requirements that apply to the use of "consumer reports" and similar data, including certain notifications to consumers where their loan application has been denied because of information contained in their consumer report. The FCRA requires us to promptly update any credit information reported to a credit reporting agency about a consumer and to allow a process by which consumers may inquire about credit information furnished by us to a consumer reporting agency. Information-Sharing Laws. We are also subject to the federal Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which limits the sharing of information for marketing purposes and requires us to adopt written procedures for detecting, preventing and responding appropriately to mitigate identity theft and to adopt various policies and procedures and provide training and materials that address the importance of protecting non-public personal information and aid us in detecting and responding to suspicious activity, including suspicious activity that may suggest a possible identity theft red flag, as appropriate. Telephonic Communication and Marketing Laws. Our telephonic communications, advertising and marketing activities are subject to several federal laws and regulations including the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices and false or misleading advertisements in all aspects of our business. As a financial services company, any advertisements related to our products must also comply with the advertising requirements set forth in TILA and must not violate the unfair, deceptive or abusive standards set forth in certain sections of the Dodd-Frank Act. Also, any of our telephone marketing activities must comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or the TCPA, the Telephone Sales Rule, or the TSR, and the Federal Communications Commission's declaratory ruling issued on July 10, 2015, or the July Declaratory Ruling. The TCPA prohibits the use of automatic telephone dialing systems for communications with wireless phone numbers without express consent of the consumer, and the TSR established the Do Not Call Registry. Based on a recent decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, issued on March 16, 2018, or the ACA Ruling, much of the July Declaratory Ruling has been vacated. Although it is possible that decisions of other appellate courts could further change the standards of conduct applicable to the use of automated telephone dialing systems, at present obtaining appropriate consent for autodialed calls and properly managing revocations of consent comply with the standard of conduct announced in the ACA Ruling. Prior to the ACA Ruling, plaintiff's lawyers were aggressively using the July Declaratory Ruling as the basis to recover damages under the TCPA of either $500 or $1,500 per call. It is too early to know the effect of the ACA Ruling on this type of litigation. Our advertising and marketing activities are also subject to the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, which establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to the source of content. Protection of Military Members and Dependents. Federal law also limits the annual percentage rate on certain loans made to active duty members of the U.S. military, reservists and members of the National Guard and their immediate families. This 36% military annual percentage rate cap applies to a variety of loan products, including short-term loans. Therefore, due to these rate restrictions, we are unable to offer certain short-term consumer loans to active duty military personnel, active reservists 85 Table of Contents and members of the National Guard and their immediate dependents. Federal law also limits the annual percentage rate on existing loans when the consumer becomes an active-duty member of the military during the life of a loan, or the spouse or dependent of an active duty member of the military during the life of the loan. Pursuant to federal law, the interest rate must be reduced to 6% per year on amounts outstanding during the time in which the service member is on active duty. Funds Transfer and Signature Authentication Laws. Our lending is also subject to the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act and various other laws, rules and guidelines relating to the procedures and disclosures required in debiting or crediting a debtor's bank account relating to a loan (i.e., ACH funds transfer). These rules and regulations protect consumers engaging in electronic fund transfers and contain restrictions, require disclosures and provide consumers certain rights relating to electronic fund transfers, including requiring a written authorization, signed or similarly authenticated, in connection with certain credit transactions payable through recurring payments. In addition, our internet lending is subject to additional federal requirements with respect to electronic signatures under the Electronic Signatures In Global And National Commerce Act and similar state laws. These laws mandate that certain disclosures be made and certain steps be followed in order to obtain and authenticate e-signatures. Debt Collection Practices. While the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, or FDCPA, expressly excludes application of its provisions to creditors, we follow the underlying principles of consumer protections and fairness outlined in the FDCPA as a guide in conducting our collection activities. Privacy and Security of Non-Public Customer Information. We are also subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security. Under these laws, including the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we must disclose to consumers our privacy policy and practices, including those policies relating to the sharing of consumers' nonpublic personal information with third parties. This disclosure must be made to consumers when the customer relationship is established and, in some cases, at least annually thereafter. These regulations also require us to ensure that our systems are designed to protect the confidentiality of consumers' nonpublic personal information. These regulations also dictate certain actions that we must take to notify consumers if their personal information is disclosed in an unauthorized manner. Anti-Money Laundering and Economic Sanctions. We are also subject to certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, or BSA, under which we must maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program covering certain of our business activities. Under regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the Treasury Department, adopted under BSA, we must report transactions involving currency in an amount greater than $10,000, and we must retain records for five years for purchases of monetary instruments for cash in amounts from $3,000 to $10,000. In general, every financial institution, including us, must report each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency or other payment or transfer, whether by, through or to the financial institution, that involves currency in an amount greater than $10,000. In addition, multiple currency transactions must be treated as single transactions if the financial institution has knowledge that the transactions are by, or on behalf of, any person and result in either cash in or cash out totaling more than $10,000 during any one business day. We rely on our point-of-sale system and employee-training programs to facilitate our compliance with these requirements. The BSA also requires certain of our subsidiaries to register as a money services business with the Treasury Department. This registration is intended to enable governmental authorities to better enforce laws prohibiting money laundering and other illegal activities. Many of our subsidiaries are registered as a money services business with the Treasury Department and must re-register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department, or FinCEN, every other year. We must also maintain a list of names and addresses of, and other information about, our locations and must make 86 Table of Contents that list available to any requesting law enforcement agency (through FinCEN). That location list must be updated at least annually. Federal anti-money-laundering laws make it a criminal offense to own or operate a money transmitting business without the appropriate state licenses, which we maintain where necessary. In addition, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and its implementing federal regulations require us, as a "financial institution," to establish and maintain an anti-money-laundering program. Such a program must include: (1) internal policies, procedures and controls designed to identify and report money laundering; (2) a designated compliance officer; (3) an ongoing employee-training program; and (4) an independent audit function to test the program. In addition, federal regulations require us to report suspicious transactions involving at least $2,000 to FinCEN. The regulations generally describe three classes of reportable suspicious transactionsone or more related transactions that the money services business knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect (1) involve funds derived from illegal activity or are intended to hide or disguise such funds, (2) are designed to evade the requirements of the BSA, or (3) appear to serve no business or lawful purpose. We rely on our point-of-sale system and employee-training programs to facilitate our compliance with these requirements. The Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") publishes a list of individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted countries. It also lists individuals, groups, and entities, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers, designated under programs that are not country-specific. Collectively, such individuals and companies are called "Specially Designated Nationals." Their assets are blocked and we are generally prohibited from dealing with them. U.S. State Regulation Our business is regulated under a variety of state enabling statutes, including payday loan, deferred presentment, check cashing, money transmission, small loan, credit access, and credit services organization state laws, among others. The scope of state regulation, including the fees and terms of our products and services, varies from state to state. Most states with laws that specifically regulate our products and services establish allowable fees and/or interest and other charges to consumers and establish minimum net worth or bonding requirements applicable to the entity to which the lending license is issued. In addition, many states regulate the maximum amount of, minimum and maximum maturity of, and impose limits on the renewal or extension of consumer loans. The terms of our products and services vary from state-to-state in order to comply with the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. While the federal FDCPA does not typically apply to our collection activities, comparable, and in some cases more rigorous, state laws apply to our collection activities. In some states, check cashing companies or money transmission agents are required to meet minimum bonding or capital requirements and are subject to record-keeping requirements and/or fee limits. We offer check cashing services in each of the states in which we operate that have licensing or fee regulations regarding check cashing, with the exception of certain Virginia locations. We are licensed in each of the states or jurisdictions in which a license is currently required for us to operate as a check cashing company and/or money transmitter. To the extent these states have adopted ceilings on check cashing fees, those ceilings are in excess of or equal to the fees we charge. The California Financing Law caps rates on loans under $2,500 but imposes no limit on loans with a principal balance of $2,500 or higher. The California Department of Business Oversight is currently evaluating whethercontrary to both our practice and general industry practicethe interest rate cap applies to loans in an original principal amount of $2,500 or more that are partially prepaid shortly after origination to reduce the principal balance to $2,500 or less. In addition, due to a recent decision 87 Table of Contents by the California Supreme Court in De La Torre v. Cash Call, Inc ., the California Department of Business Oversight or private plaintiffs may argue that notwithstanding the absence of an express statutory maximum on interest rates for loans with principal amounts in excess of $2,500, that loans with triple digit interest rates are unconscionable and therefore unenforceable. In Texas and Ohio, we operate under a Credit Service Organization, "or CSO", model. In Texas, this model is expressly authorized under Section 393 of the Texas Finance Code. As a CSO, we serve as arranger for consumers to obtain credit from independent, non-bank consumer lending companies and we guaranty the lender against loss. As required by Texas law, we are registered as a CSO and also licensed as a "Credit Access Business" or CAB. Texas law subjects us to audit by the State's Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner and requires us to provide expanded disclosures to customers regarding credit service products. The subsidiary operating as a CSO in Ohio is currently registered under the Ohio Credit Services Organization Act with the Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Financial Institutions. As a CSO, that subsidiary currently provides credit services to customers in accordance with the Credit Services Organization Act. Unlike Texas law, however, the Ohio Credit Services Organization Act does not expressly authorize the loan program we offer. Operating as a registered CSO allows us to charge a fee for arranging loans to our customers from unaffiliated third-party lenders, for assisting customers in preparing and completing the information and documents that the unaffiliated third-party lenders require the customers to submit in order to obtain loans and for providing guarantees of customer obligations to the unaffiliated third-party lenders. We determine whether we are prepared to guarantee the loans, using our own underwriting guidelines, and the lender applies its own underwriting guidelines in determining whether to make the loan. We obtain assurances from lenders that they comply with applicable federal and Ohio laws when setting loan terms. Although our subsidiary has operated as a CSO in Ohio for several years, Ohio House Bill 123, or HB 123, was signed by Ohio's Governor on July 30, 2018. HB 123 prohibits credit services organizations, such as the Company's CSO subsidiary currently operating in Ohio, from brokering an extension of credit if that credit is in a principal amount of less than five thousand dollars, with a term less than 180-days, and that has an annual percentage rate greater than 28%. HB 123 became effective on October 30, 2018, but applies only to loans or extensions of credit made on or after April 28, 2019. The Company is evaluating product alternatives that could be offered to Ohio consumers. In addition to federal laws imposing requirements on us relative to privacy and security of non-public customer information, our subsidiaries are subject to state laws imposing additional requirements. For example, in 2018 California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA. This data privacy law is generally applicable to entities serving or employing California residents and requires compliance by January 2020. The CCPA is regarded as the most comprehensive consumer privacy law in the nation. The CCPA grants California residents new rights regarding their personal information and imposes various data protection duties on certain entities, including the Company's subsidiaries, conducting business in California. Also in 2018, Ohio adopted the Ohio Data Protection Act, which provides certain safe harbors if an entity adopts cybersecurity measures designed to: (1) protect the security and confidentiality of personal information; (2) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the personal information; and (3) protect against unauthorized access to and acquisition of information that is likely to result in a material risk of identity theft or other fraud. While the Company believes that its systems qualify as safe harbors under the Ohio Data Protection Act, it is currently evaluating the impact of the CCPA on its data collection and retention processes. In the event of serious or systemic violations of state law, we would be subject to a variety of regulatory sanctions and private lawsuits. These could include license suspension or revocation; orders or injunctive relief, including judicial or administrative orders providing for restitution or other affirmative relief; and statutory penalties and damages. Depending upon the nature and scope of any 88 Table of Contents violation, statutory penalties and damages could include fines for each violation and/or payments to borrowers equal to a multiple of the fees we charge and in some cases the principal amount loaned as well. In our lending operations, we do not utilize the so-called "choice of law" model of lending, where a lender attempts to make loans in one state under a contract clause calling for the application of another state's substantive laws. Rather, in making loans to consumers we attempt to comply in full with the substantive laws of the state in which the loan was originated. Certain of our subsidiaries rely heavily on the use of lead generators or providers as a source of first-time borrowers. Although these subsidiaries conduct regular compliance reviews of these lead generators or providers in order to ensure that each utilizes appropriate privacy and other disclosures to prospective borrowers as to how and where the prospective borrower's personal, non-public information may be disclosed, several states and the CFPB have expressed concerns with lead generators and their compliance with applicable laws and regulations and the flow of non-public, private consumer information between lead generators and lead buyers. In addition, several states in which we operate substantially impair the ability to use lead generators or, in the case of California, have indicated an intention to regulate this conduct in the future. In the last ten years, several states in which we operate, including Illinois, Colorado, South Dakota, Kentucky, Ohio and Virginia, have enacted laws (or in the case of Arizona, allowed the deferred presentment law to expire) that negatively impact our short-term consumer loan business by imposing new limitations or requirements or effectively prohibiting the loan products we offer. We intend to continue, together with others in the consumer loan industry, to inform and educate legislators and regulators and to oppose legislative or regulatory action that would prohibit or severely restrict our offering of consumer loans. Given the pressure exerted on state legislative bodies by the Pew Charitable Trust, the Center for Responsible Lending, and various media outlets, it is likely that increased regulatory pressure and legislative action will continue to occur to the detriment of all small-dollar, high cost lenders, including us. Local Regulation In addition to state and federal laws and regulations, our industry is subject to various local rules, regulations and ordinances. These local rules, regulations and ordinances change and vary widely from city-to-city. Local jurisdictions' efforts to restrict short-term lending have been steadily increasing. Typically, these local ordinances apply to storefront operations; however, local jurisdictions could attempt to enforce certain business conduct and registration requirements on internet lending to residents of that jurisdiction, even though no such attempt has been made previously. Actions taken in the future by local governing bodies to impose other restrictions on consumer lenders such as us could impact our business.

Lockhart, Heller and Schutt. Mr. Schutt serves as Chairman.

Our board of managers has determined that each member of our Audit Committee is "independent" within the meaning of Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our board of managers has also determined that each member of our Audit Committee is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC regulations. Our Audit Committee is responsible for the review and approval of all related-party transactions required to be disclosed to the public under SEC rules. This procedure is contained in the written charter of our Audit Committee. In addition, we maintain a written Code of Ethics that requires our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer or controller, to 92 Table of Contents disclose to the Company's Legal Department any material relationship or transaction that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a personal conflict of interest. Those relationships and transactions are then reported to the Audit Committee, which then reviews and, if appropriate, approves those transactions on a case-by-case basis. In making any such approvals, the Audit Committee considers a number of factors, including whether the terms of the transaction are market standard or whether such terms are no less favorable to the Company than could be obtained from an unrelated party.

Manager Compensation During the period between the closing of the Restructuring and December 31, 2018, William E. Saunders, Jr , Eugene Lockhart, Michael Heller, Jennifer Adams Baldock, and Eugene Schutt served as our managers. In 2018, we had four managers not employed by us, and we refer to these four managers as "non-employee managers."

Our Compensation Committee is working to establish a compensation program for our non-employee managers and has engaged Meridian Compensation Consultants to assist in establishing the elements of 93 Table of Contents our compensation program. In consultation with Meridian, the Committee determined that each manager will receive an annual cash retainer of $110,000, the chairpersons of the audit committee, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee will receive an additional $25,000, $20,000 and $15,000, respectively. Each manager serving on a committee will receive an additional $10,000 for each committee on which the manager serves. Board Observation Right In connection with the restructuring and pursuant to our limited liability company agreement, we have given SMH Capital Advisors, LLC ("SMH") the ability to nominate one non-voting observer to our board of Managers. This right shall continue until such time that either the PIK Notes are redeemed or SMH and its affiliates no longer hold an aggregate principal amount of at least $15 million of PIK Notes. Subject to certain exceptions, SMH's designee has the a right to attend all meetings of the board of Managers and the right to receive, at the same time, all information pertaining to any such meetings provided to the managers. SMH has nominated Dwayne Moyers as its designated observer to serve until the earlier of the designation of his successor or the termination of the observation right. The designated observer receives no compensation from us for serving in such capacity. Approval Rights Pursuant to our limited liability company agreement, Qualified Noteholders or Former Qualified Noteholders (each as defined under "Description of Equity Securities") have approval rights over certain actions by the Company, including:  the issuance, purchase, exchange, redemption, repurchase of or determination whether to exercise repurchase rights in respect of any units of the Company or equity securities of any of our subsidiaries;  the adoption of any management incentive plan;  the entering into an agreement to effect a public offering of our securities;  the incurrence of debt by us or any of our subsidiaries other than trade payables or other debt incurred in the ordinary course of business or other debt permitted to be incurred by each of the senior notes and our revolving credit facility;  the refinancing of our senior notes or our revolving credit facility;  the giving by us or our subsidiaries of any guaranties or indemnities in connection with debt or other obligations;  any amendment to our limited liability company agreement or certificate of formation;  the entry into certain change of control transactions and acquisitions by the Company;  any redemption, repurchase or other form of satisfaction of the PIK Notes; and  a change in the principal place of business of the Company to a place outside of the United States.

Saunders, Jr.Chief Executive Officer;  Michael J. DurbinExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, and Treasurer; and  Kyle F. HansonPresident and Chief Operating Officer. All compensation paid to our named executive officers in 2018 was paid by CCFI, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of the Company that was previously a subsidiary of our Predecessor. Elements of Compensation Our Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing and administering our policies governing the compensation for our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee is composed entirely of non-employee managers. For the period between the closing of the Restructuring and December 31, 2018, each of our named executive officers was paid a pro rata portion of the base salary approved by our Predecessor's compensation committee. In addition, our Compensation Committee approved a one-time cash bonus for each named executive officer taking into consideration each named executive officer's performance during 2018 and the events surrounding the Restructuring, and to incentivize the named executive officers to remain with the Company. During the period between the closing of the Restructuring and December 31, 2018, our named executive officers continued to receive the same health and welfare benefits and retirement savings benefits as they had received from the Predecessor. We did not grant any equity awards to our named executive officers during 2018. The Compensation Committee believes that named executive officer compensation packages should incorporate an appropriate balance of fixed versus variable compensationas well as cash-based compensation versus equity-based compensationand reward performance that is measured against established goals that correspond to our short-term and long-term business plan and objectives. Our Compensation Committee engaged Meridian Compensation Consultants ("Meridian") to assist in establishing the elements of our 2019 compensation program and intends to continue to work with Meridian to establish compensation plans for future years. Our executive officers will receive cash compensation for 2019, but will not receive equity awards. The Compensation Committee will evaluate future equity awards in light of the performance of each individual executive officer and our Company's performance overall. We do not expect to enter into employment agreements with our named executive officers. We generally expect to offer the same retirement savings opportunities and health and welfare benefits to our named executive officers that our Predecessor offered. The Compensation Committee intends to design our compensation program to achieve the following objectives:  Motivate and reward executives whose knowledge, skills and performance are critical to our success;  Align the interests of our executives and equity holders by motivating executives to increase equity holder value and rewarding executives for attention to creating long-term equity holder value increases, but doing so in a manner that does not encourage executives to take unreasonable risks that could threaten our viability;  Provide a competitive compensation package that emphasizes pay for performance, and in which total compensation is primarily determined by Company and individual results and long-term increases in equity holder value; 95 Table of Contents  Ensure fairness among the named executive officers by recognizing the relative contributions each executive makes to our success;  Attract and retain talented and experienced executives in the highly competitive and dynamic financial services industry;  Foster a shared commitment among executives by coordinating their Company and individual goals; and  Compensate our executives to manage our business to meet our long-range objectives.

All of the securities registered hereby were issued in connection with the Restructuring. We are registering these securities pursuant to a registration rights agreement with respect to the securities by and among us and each of the selling security holders named below. With respect to the PIK Notes, we have assumed the maximum aggregate principal amount of PIK Notes will be issued as in-kind interest payments on the currently outstanding PIK Notes. The selling security holders may from time to time offer and sell pursuant to this prospectus any or all of the securities owned by them but make no representation that any of the securities will be offered for sale. The table below sets forth the name of each selling security holder, the aggregate principal amount of PIK Notes, the number of Class A Common Units and the number of Class B Common Units that each selling security holder may offer pursuant to this prospectus, from time to time, as of the date of this prospectus. Except as noted below in the footnotes to the table, neither the selling security holders nor their members had any position, office or other material relationship with us or any of our affiliates since our inception. The information regarding the selling security holders is based on information available to us as of , 2019. As of , 2019, the selling security holders are the only beneficial owners of the PIK Notes, the Class A Common Units and the Class B Common Units; therefore percentage ownership calculations are based on $471,334,941 aggregate principal amount of PIK Notes, 850,000 Class A Common Units and 150,000 Class B Common Units. Because the selling security holders may offer all, some or none of the securities pursuant to this prospectus, and because there currently are no agreements, arrangements or understandings with respect to the sale of any of these securities, no definitive estimate can be given as to the amount or number of securities that will be held by the selling security holders after completion of this offering. The following table has been prepared assuming that the selling stockholders sell all of the securities beneficially owned by them that have been registered for resale by us and do not acquire any additional PIK Notes this offering. We cannot advise you as to whether the selling stockholders will in fact sell any or all of their securities. In addition, the selling stockholders may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, at any time and from time to time, the securities in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act after the date for which the information set forth in the table below is provided. Information concerning the selling security holders may change from time to time, and any changed information may be set forth in prospectus supplements or post-effective amendments, as may be appropriate.

The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement allows for borrowings of up to $40.0 million and has a maturity date of June 15, 2023. The capacity for borrowings under the facility was reduced from $42.0 million to $40.0 million in connection with the $2.0 million repayment on January 15, 2019.

The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of CCF OpCo and is eliminated upon consolidation.

Furthermore, the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement requires compliance with covenants that relate to financial performance, including minimum EBITDA, asset coverage and minimum liquidity tests. The administrative agent under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement is required to take direction from a representative of the holders of the Secured Notes. The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement also contains a cross-default to the Secured Notes and the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of April 25, 2017 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time) with Ivy Funding Nine, LLC, as lender and CCFI Funding II, LLC, a non-guarantor subsidiary of CCF OpCo (the "Ivy Credit Agreement").

CCF Issuer was also required to pledge its interests in the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement. The Amended and Restated SPV Indenture also contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or make other distributions or repurchase our capital stock or the capital stock of our subsidiaries, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, create liens or merge with or into other companies. 104 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2018, there was $42.0 million in outstanding Secured Notes.

As of December 31, 2018, there was $70.0 million outstanding under the Ivy Credit Agreement. 105 Table of Contents DESCRIPTION OF PIK NOTES General In connection with the restructuring, CCF Holdings LLC (the "Issuer") issued the 10.750% Senior PIK Notes (the "Notes") pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of December 12, 2018 (the "Indenture") among itself and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company LLC (the "Trustee"). Certain terms used in this "Description of the PIK Notes" have the meanings set forth in the section "Certain Definitions". As used in this section, "we", "us" and "our" mean the Issuer and its Subsidiaries and the "Issuer" refers only to CCF Holdings LLC. and not to any of its Subsidiaries. The following summary of certain provisions of the Indenture and the Notes does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of those agreements and instruments, including the definitions of certain terms used therein and those terms made a part thereof by the TIA. We urge you to read those agreements and instruments because they, not this description, will define your rights as Holders of the Notes. You may request copies of those documents at our address set forth under the heading "Where You Can Find Additional Information". Brief Description of Notes The Notes are:  general senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer;  pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer;  effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including all amounts outstanding under our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement and our Secured Notes) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and  structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other claims and liabilities, including preferred stock, of Subsidiaries of the Issuer. Ranking The Notes rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any of our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and our Secured Notes) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries, including our subsidiaries' obligations, whether as borrower or guarantor, under the Ivy Credit Agreement, our revolving credit facility, the Secured Notes and trade payables. As of December 31, 2018, our total consolidated principal amount of indebtedness outstanding was $390.8 million, of which an aggregate of $276.9 million was senior indebtedness and an aggregate of $113.8 million was secured indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries had $167.3 million of indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables, but excluding intercompany obligations and liabilities of a type not required to be reflected on a balance sheet of such subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP) to which the PIK Notes are structurally subordinated. As of December 31, 2018, our revolving credit facility was fully drawn. Although the Indenture contains limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Issuer may incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such additional Indebtedness could be substantial. See "Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock" 106 Table of Contents Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes The Issuer maintains one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial paying agent for the Notes is the Trustee. The Issuer also maintains a registrar. The initial registrar is the Trustee. The registrar maintains a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time and makes payments on and facilitates transfer of Notes on behalf of the Issuer. The Issuer may change the paying agents or the registrars without prior notice to the Holders. Either the Issuer or any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent or registrar. Transfer and Exchange A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer, or other tender offer. Also, the Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed. Principal, Maturity and Interest The Issuer issued $276,940,398 aggregate principal amount of Notes on December 12, 2018 (the "Initial Notes"). The Notes mature on December 15, 2023. Interest on the Notes accrues at the rate of 10.750% per annum and is payable by increasing the principal amount of a Note or by issuing additional Notes in a principal amount equal to such interest ("PIK Interest"). PIK Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 to the Holders of Notes of record on the immediately preceding June 1 and December 1. Interest on the Notes accrues from the most recent date to which interest has been paid. Interest on the Notes is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. We refer to payments of PIK Interest as "PIK Note Payments." PIK Note Payments shall be effected (i) with respect to Notes in certificated form, by issuing Notes in certificated form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of PIK Interest to be paid on the principal amount of Notes held by each Holder on the relevant record date (rounded down to the nearest $1.00) or (ii) with respect to Global Notes, by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Global Note by an amount equal to the amount of PIK Interest to be paid on the principal amount of Global Notes on the relevant record date (rounded down to the nearest $1.00), and the Trustee will, at the written order of the Issuer signed by an Officer, authenticate and deliver such Notes on the Interest Payment Date in certificated form for original issuance to the Holders of record on the relevant record date or cause such increase in principal amount with respect to Global Notes. Following an increase in the principal amount of the outstanding Global Notes as a result of a PIK Note Payment, the Notes will bear interest on such increased principal amount from and after the date of such PIK Note Payment. Any Notes issued in certificated form will be dated as of the applicable Interest Payment Date and will bear interest from and after such date. The Initial Notes and any Notes issued subsequently as PIK Interest under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to "Notes" for all purposes of the Indenture and this "Description of the PIK Notes" include any Notes that are issued as PIK Interest. Additional interest may be payable with respect to the Notes in certain circumstances pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. See "The Exchange OfferLiquidated Damages". 107 Table of Contents Optional Redemption On or, to the extent provided below, prior to and within 90 days after, the occurrence of the Bondholder NewCo Option Event, the Issuer may redeem all (but not all than less than all) of the outstanding Notes, at any time by delivery of Class A Common Units, subject to the following provisions: (1) For so long as there is a Qualified Noteholder, the Issuer may not elect to optionally settle the Notes in Class A Common Units unless such election shall have been approved by at least a majority of the members of the Board of the Issuer then in office, which majority, prior to the fourth anniversary of the Issue Date, shall have included the Qualified Noteholder Directors (or, if only one such person shall then be a member of the Board, such Member); provided, however, that prior to the fourth anniversary of the Issue Date in the event that the Total Enterprise Value of the Issuer has not been determined by the Board of the Issuer to be greater than $300 million (as evidenced by an Officer's Certificate, to which a resolution of the Board of the Issuer setting forth such determination is annexed, delivered to the Trustee), in addition to the foregoing requirements, the Change of Control Transaction, shall be approved by a Super-Majority Board Approval (as evidenced by an Officer's Certificate, to which a resolution of the Board of the Issuer confirming such approval is annexed, delivered to the Trustee); (2) Notice of any redemption to be made upon the occurrence of a Bondholder NewCo Option Event may be given in advance of any such Bondholder NewCo Option Event, but subject to the occurrence of any relevant Change of Control Transaction or the Maturity Date, as the case may be, and any other condition specified in the notice of redemption; (3) Upon the Issuer's exercise of the redemption pursuant to this optional redemption provision, on and after the redemption date, any right of the Holders of the Notes to receive payments in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes shall automatically be terminated, the indebtedness and other obligations of the Issuer to Holders of Notes automatically shall be extinguished without any further action by any Person, and each Holder of Notes shall only have the right to receive the redemption price in Class A Common Units and/or, if applicable, the consideration payable in the relevant Change of Control Transaction in respect of Class A Common Units; (4) The number of Class A Common Units issuable to the Holders in payment of the redemption price in respect of any Bondholder NewCo Option Event shall be equal to, for each $1.00 principal amount of Notes so redeemed (including any PIK Interest that has been capitalized), the Settlement Rate; (5) The Issuer shall pay any and all documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes imposed by the United States of America or any state thereof that may be payable in respect of the issuance and delivery of Class A Common Units upon any redemption made in respect of any Bondholder NewCo Option Event unless the taxes are due because the Holder requests such Units to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name or delivered to a person other than the Holder, in which case the Holder shall pay such taxes; and (6) No fractional units of Class A Common Units shall be delivered by the Issuer to the Holders in payment of the redemption price pursuant in respect of any Bondholder NewCo Option Event, and all such fractional amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Unit. At any time or from time to time, the Issuer may redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon notice as provided under the Indenture, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding the date of 108 Table of Contents redemption, subject to the rights of Holders on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall not be required to deliver Class A Common Units in connection with a redemption to the extent that it delivers the consideration payable in the relevant Change of Control Transaction in respect of Class A Common Units in lieu thereof. Mandatory Redemption upon a Class A Public Offering In the event that the Issuer completes a public offering of Class A Common Units registered with the SEC (a "Class A Public Offering") in which (i) the gross cash proceeds of Class A Common Units sold by the Company equal or exceed $200 million and (ii) the product of the gross cash price per such Class A Common Unit in the Class A Public Offering and the number of Mandatory Redemption Date Class A Common Units Outstanding equals or exceeds the Mandatory Redemption Target Value, the Notes shall be automatically redeemed on the Mandatory Redemption Date for Class A Common Units at the Settlement Rate. Notice of any mandatory redemption in respect of a Class A Public Offering may be given in advance of the consummation of any such Class A Public Offering and subject to the occurrence thereof. On and after a Mandatory Redemption Date, any right of the Holders of the Notes to receive payments in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes shall automatically be terminated, the indebtedness and other obligations of the Issuer to Holders of Notes automatically shall be extinguished without any further action by any Person, and each Holder of Notes shall only have the right to receive the redemption price in Class A Common Units. The number of Class A Common Units issuable to the Holders in payment of the redemption price in respect of a Class A Public Offering shall be equal to, for each $1.00 principal amount of Notes so redeemed (including any PIK Interest that has been capitalized), the Settlement Rate. The Issuer shall pay any and all documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes imposed by the United States of America or any state thereof that may be payable in respect of the issuance and delivery of Class A Common Units upon any redemption made in respect of a Class A Public Offering unless the taxes are due because the Holder requests such Units to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name or delivered to a person other than the Holder, in which case the Holder shall pay such taxes. No fractional units of Class A Common Units shall be delivered by the Issuer to the Holders in payment of the redemption price in respect of a Class A Public Offering, and all such fractional amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Unit. Notice of any mandatory redemption in respect of a Class A Public Offering may be given in advance of the consummation of any such Class A Public Offering and subject to the occurrence thereof. In the event of a mandatory redemption in respect of a Class A Public Offering, the Issuer shall promptly, and in any event within 15 days after the closing date of the relevant Class A Public Offering (the "Notice Deadline"), provide a notice of mandatory redemption to the Holders, which such notice shall state: (1) the redemption date (the "Mandatory Redemption Date"), which shall be no later than 15 days after the Notice Deadline; (2) the redemption price, which shall be the Settlement Rate; (3) the name and address of the Paying Agent, if other than the Trustee; 109 Table of Contents (4) that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price; (5) that on and after the Mandatory Redemption Date, any right of the Holders of the Notes to receive payments in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes shall automatically be terminated, the indebtedness and other obligations of the Issuer to Holders of Notes automatically shall be extinguished without any further action by any Person, and each Holder of Notes shall only have the right to receive the redemption price in Class A Common Units; (6) that, unless the Issuer defaults in making such redemption payment, interest on Notes called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the Mandatory Redemption Date; (7) the paragraph or subparagraph of the Notes and/or Section of this Indenture pursuant to which the Notes called for redemption are being redeemed; and (8) that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Notes. Except as set forth above, the Issuer shall not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control The Notes provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless, prior to the time the Issuer is required to make a Change of Control Offer (as defined below), the Issuer has previously mailed or concurrently mails a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under "Selection and Notice" the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the " Change of Control Offer ") at a price in cash (the " Change of Control Payment ") equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant captioned "Repurchase at the Option of HoldersChange of Control" and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) a description of the transaction or transactions constituting a Change of Control; (3) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 20 Business Days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"); (4) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (5) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of such Notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice 110 Table of Contents at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (7) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the expiration time of the Change of Control Offer, a telegram, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of the Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased; (8) that if less than all of such Holder's Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be issued new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered; provided that the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to $1.00 or an integral multiple of $1.00 in excess thereof; (9) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control; and (10) such other instructions, as determined by us, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a Holder must follow. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered, and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer's Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement and the Secured Notes provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, the Secured Notes and/or such other agreement, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, the Secured Notes and/or such other agreement. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, the Secured Notes and/or such other agreement, such default could result in amounts outstanding under our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement and/or such other agreement being declared due and payable. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See "Risk FactorsRisks Relating to our Capital 111 Table of Contents StructureA change in control of the Company could require us to repay certain of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to do so". The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under "Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock" and "Certain CovenantsLiens". Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of "Change of Control" includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all", there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of "all or substantially all" of the assets of the Issuer. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of Change of Control, may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. Certain Covenants Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture. Limitation on Restricted Payments The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly: (I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the Issuer's or any of its Subsidiaries' Equity Interests, including any dividend or distribution payable in connection with any merger, consolidation or amalgamation, other than: (a) dividends, payments or distributions by the Issuer payable solely in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer; or 112 Table of Contents (b) dividends, payments or distributions by a Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any dividend, payment or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by a Subsidiary other than a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Issuer, the Issuer or a Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, the Issuer could incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness under the provisions of the first paragraph of the covenant described under "Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock;" and (3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Issuer after the Issue Date (including Restricted Payments made pursuant to clause (1), (4) or (7) of Section 5.08(b), but excluding all other Restricted Payments made pursuant to the second paragraph of this covenant, is less than the sum of (without duplication): (a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting period) beginning on the first day of the fiscal quarter commencing after the Issue Date to the end of the Issuer's most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment, or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit; plus (b) 100% of the aggregate cash proceeds and the fair market value of marketable securities or other property received by the Issuer since immediately after the Issue Date (other than cash 113 Table of Contents proceeds to the extent such cash proceeds have been used to make Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (2) of the next succeeding paragraph) from the issue or sale of: (i) (A) Equity Interests of the Issuer, excluding cash proceeds and the marketable securities or other property received from the sale of: (x) Equity Interests to any future, current or former employee, director or consultant of the Issuer, any Parent Entity or any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries after the Issue Date to the extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted Payments made in accordance with clause (4) of the next succeeding paragraph;

or (ii) debt securities of the Issuer that have been subsequently converted into or exchanged for Equity Interests of the Issuer; provided, however, that this clause (b) shall not include the proceeds from (X) Equity Interests or convertible debt securities of the Issuer sold to a Subsidiary or (Y) Disqualified Stock or debt securities that have been converted into Disqualified Stock; plus (c) 100% of the aggregate amount of cash and the fair market value of marketable securities or other property contributed to the capital of the Issuer after the Issue Date (other than cash proceeds, marketable securities or other property to the extent such cash proceeds, marketable securities or other property (i) have been used to make Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (1) of the next succeeding paragraph or (ii) are contributed by a Subsidiary); plus (d) 100% of the aggregate amount received in cash and the fair market value of marketable securities or other property received by means of the sale or other disposition (other than to the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries) of Restricted Investments made by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries and repurchases and redemptions of such Restricted Investments from the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries and repayments of loans or advances, and releases of guarantees, that constitute Restricted Investments made by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, after the Issue Date. The foregoing provisions will not prohibit: (1) the payment of any dividend or distribution or the consummation of any irrevocable redemption within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof or the giving of such irrevocable notice, as applicable, if at the date of declaration or the giving of such notice such payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture; (2) the redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition of any Equity Interests, or Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale (other than to the Issuer or a Subsidiary) of, Equity Interests of the Issuer or contributions to the equity capital of the Issuer (in each case, other than any Disqualified Stock or, except in the case of a redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition of Subordinated Indebtedness or Preferred Stock); (3) the redemption, defeasance, repurchase or other acquisition or retirement of (i) Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer made in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of a sale made within 45 days of, new Indebtedness of the Issuer, as the case may be, or (ii) Disqualified Stock of 114 Table of Contents the Issuer made in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of a sale made within 45 days of, Disqualified Stock of the Issuer, that, so long as: (a) the principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of such new Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of such new Disqualified Stock does not exceed the principal amount of (or accreted value, if applicable), plus any accrued and unpaid interest on, the Subordinated Indebtedness, or the liquidation preference of, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends on, the Disqualified Stock, being so defeased, redeemed, repurchased, exchanged, acquired or retired for value; (b) in the case of Subordinated Indebtedness, such new Indebtedness is subordinated to the Indebtedness under the Notes at least to the same extent as such Subordinated Indebtedness so purchased, defeased, exchanged, redeemed, repurchased, acquired or retired for value; (c) such new Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock has a final scheduled maturity date equal to or later than the final scheduled maturity date of the Subordinated Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock being so purchased, defeased, redeemed, repurchased, exchanged, acquired or retired; and (d) such new Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock has a Weighted Average Life to Maturity equal to or greater than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Subordinated Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock being so purchased, defeased, redeemed, repurchased, exchanged, acquired or retired; (4) a Restricted Payment to pay for the repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or any Parent Entity held by any future, present or former employee, director or consultant of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any Parent Entity pursuant to any management equity plan or stock option plan or any other management or employee benefit plan or agreement, or any stock subscription or shareholder agreement; provided, however, that the aggregate Restricted Payments made under this clause (4) do not exceed in any calendar year $7.5 million (with unused amounts in any calendar year being carried over to succeeding calendar years subject to a maximum (without giving effect to the following proviso) of $15.0 million in any calendar year); provided further that such amount in any calendar year may be increased by an amount not to exceed: (a) the cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock) of the Issuer and, to the extent contributed to the Issuer, the cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests of any Parent Entity, in each case to any future, present or former employees, directors or consultants of the Issuer, any of its Subsidiaries or any Parent Entity that occurs after the Issue Date; provided that the amount of such cash proceeds utilized for any such repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value will not increase the amount available for Restricted Payments under clause (3) of the immediately preceding paragraph; plus (b) the cash proceeds of key man life insurance policies received by the Issuer or its Subsidiaries after the Issue Date; less the amount of any Restricted Payments previously made with the cash proceeds described in clause (a) or (b) of this clause (4);

provided that all such dividends are included in the calculation of "Fixed Charges"; 115 Table of Contents (6) payments made by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiary in respect of withholding or similar taxes payable upon exercise of Equity Interests by any future, present or former employee, director or consultant and repurchases of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon exercise of stock options or warrants if such Equity Interests represent a portion of the exercise price of such options or warrants;

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a payment or other action meets the criteria of more than one of the exceptions described in clauses (1) through (8) above, or is permitted to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant (including by virtue of qualifying as a Permitted Investment), the Issuer will be permitted to classify such payment or other action on the date of its occurrence in any manner that complies with this covenant. Payments or other actions permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such payment or other action but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such payment or other action (including pursuant to any section of the definition of "Permitted Investment"). Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, "incur" and collectively, an "incurrence") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer shall not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock and shall not permit any Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock;

(2) the incurrence by the Issuer of Indebtedness represented by the Notes to be issued on the date of this Indenture (and all Notes payable as PIK Interest issued in respect thereof); (3) Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries in existence on the Issue Date (other than Indebtedness described in clause (1) of this paragraph; (4) Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries constituting reimbursement obligations with respect to bankers' acceptances, bank guarantees, letters of credit, warehouse receipts or similar facilities entered into in the ordinary course of business, including letters of credit in respect of workers' compensation claims, performance or surety bonds, health, disability or other employee benefits or property, casualty or liability insurance or self-insurance or other Indebtedness with respect to reimbursement type obligations regarding workers' compensation claims, performance or surety bonds, health, disability or other employee benefits or property, casualty or liability insurance or self-insurance, in each case (other than in the case of performance or surety bonds incurred to satisfy a regulatory requirement) incurred in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such obligations are reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing or incurrence; (5) Indebtedness (including Capitalized Lease Obligations), Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock incurred by the Issuer or any of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer to finance the purchase, lease, construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal), equipment or other asset (including receivables) that is used or useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock incurred or issued to refund, refinance, replace, renew, extend or defease any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred or issued as permitted under this clause (5) or for working capital or any general corporate purposes; provided that the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock incurred or issued pursuant to this clause (5), when aggregated with the outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock incurred or issued to refund, refinance, replace, renew, extend or defease Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock initially incurred or issued in reliance on this clause (5), does not exceed the greater of $10,000,000 and 2.0% of Total Assets; (6) Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries providing for indemnification, adjustment of purchase price, earnout or similar obligations, in each case, incurred or assumed in connection with the disposition of any business, assets or a Subsidiary, other than guarantees of Indebtedness incurred by any Person acquiring all or any portion of such business, assets or a Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition; provided, however, that the maximum assumable liability in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds including non-cash proceeds (the fair market value of such 117 Table of Contents non-cash proceeds being measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value) actually received by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition; (7) Indebtedness of the Issuer to any of its Subsidiaries; provided that any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event that results in any such Subsidiary ceasing to be a Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of any such Indebtedness shall be deemed, in each case, to be an incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (to the extent not otherwise permitted by this clause); (8) Indebtedness of a Subsidiary owing to the Issuer or another Subsidiary; provided that any subsequent transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event that results in any such Subsidiary ceasing to be a Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of any such Indebtedness shall be deemed, in each case, to be an incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (to the extent not otherwise permitted by this clause); (9) shares of Preferred Stock of a Subsidiary issued to the Issuer or another Subsidiary; provided that any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event that results in any such Subsidiary ceasing to be a Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of any such shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed in each case to be an issuance of such shares of Preferred Stock not permitted by this clause (to the extent not otherwise permitted by this clause);

provided that after giving pro forma effect to such acquisition, amalgamation, merger or consolidation, either: (a) the Issuer would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of this covenant; or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer is greater than such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such acquisition, amalgamation, merger or consolidation; (14) cash management obligations and other Indebtedness in respect of netting services, automatic clearing house arrangements, employees' credit or purchase cards, endorsements of instruments for deposit, overdraft protections and similar arrangements, in each case incurred in the ordinary course of business: (15) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries supported by a letter of credit issued pursuant to Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (1) of this Section 5.07(b), in a principal amount not in excess of the stated amount of such letter of credit and only so long as such letter of credit remains outstanding;

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant: (1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted 119 Table of Contents Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in clauses (1) through (20) of Section 5.07(b) or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to Section 5.07(a), the Issuer, in its sole discretion, shall classify, and may later reclassify, such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this Section 5.07; provided that (x) all Indebtedness outstanding in respect of the SPV II Notes and the Secured Notes shall be treated as incurred under clause (1) of Section 5.07(b) and (y) the Issuer shall not be permitted to reclassify, refund, refinance, replace, renew or defease all or any portion of any Indebtedness incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant; and (2) at the time of incurrence, the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs above. Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (i) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of accrued interest, fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture does not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or junior to secured Indebtedness and (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral. Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets The Issuer shall not consolidate, merge or amalgamate with or into or wind up into (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless: (1) The Issuer is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation or merger or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a Person organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof (such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the "Successor"); 120 Table of Contents (2) the Successor expressly assumes all the obligations of the Issuer under this Indenture and the Notes pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; (3) immediately after such transaction, no Default exists; and (4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer complies with this Indenture and an Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel to the effect that any such supplemental indenture is permitted or authorized by the Indenture. Notwithstanding clause (3) above, (1) any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries may consolidate or amalgamate with or merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or any of its Subsidiary; and (2) the Issuer may consolidate, amalgamate or merge with an Affiliate of the Issuer solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer in another state in the United States, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries is not increased thereby. Transactions with Affiliates The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee (each of the foregoing, a "transaction") with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (each of the foregoing, an "Affiliate Transaction") involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $5.0 million unless: (1) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or the relevant Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm's-length basis; and (2) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $15.0 million, a resolution adopted by the majority of the Board of the Issuer approving such Affiliate Transaction and set forth in an Officer's Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (1) above. The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following: (1) transactions between or among the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any entity that becomes a Subsidiary as a result of such transaction, so long as such transaction is otherwise consummated in compliance with this Indenture; (2) Restricted Payments permitted by the provisions of the Indenture described above under the covenant "Limitation on Restricted Payments" and Permitted Investments permitted by clause (11) or (12) of the definition of "Permitted Investments";

(5) any agreement or arrangement (including the LLC Agreement, this Indenture, the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Secured Notes) as in effect as of the Issue Date, and payments and other actions contemplated thereby, as the same may be amended after the Issue Date, so long as any such amendments, when taken as a whole, are not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders; (6) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries of its obligations under the terms of, any stockholders agreement or the equivalent thereof (including any registration rights agreement or purchase agreement related thereto) to which it is a party as of the Issue Date and any amendment thereto or any similar agreement that it may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that any such amendment and any similar agreement shall not contain terms that, when taken as a whole, are disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders; (7) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services that are Affiliates, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Indenture and that are fair to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the Board of the Issuer or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party; (8) the issuance or transfer of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer to any Parent Entity or to any Qualified Noteholder or to any director, officer, employee or consultant (or their respective estates, investment funds, investment vehicles, spouses or former spouses) of the Issuer, any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries or any Parent Entity and the granting and performing of reasonable and customary registration rights with respect to such Equity Interests; (9) payments or loans (or cancellation of loans) to employees, directors or consultants of the Issuer, any of the Subsidiaries or any Parent Entity and employment agreements, stock option plans and other similar arrangements with such employees, directors or consultants that, in each case, that are approved by the Board of the Issuer in good faith;

(12) transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Issuer solely because the Issuer owns any Equity Interest in, or controls, such Person; provided that, no Affiliate of the Issuer, other than the Issuer or a Subsidiary, shall have a beneficial interest or otherwise participate in such Person other than through such Affiliate's ownership of the Issuer; (13) transactions that are approved in accordance with the Section 6.9 of the LLC Agreement or any successor provision thereto; (14) payments by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries pursuant to tax sharing agreements among the Issuer (and any Parent Entity) and its Subsidiaries;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest, if any, on or with respect to the Notes; (3) failure by the Issuer after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clause (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both: (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated final maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, is, in the aggregate, $25.0 million; (5) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Subsidiaries that together (determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal 123 Table of Contents quarter) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $25.0 million or more (net of amounts covered by insurance policies issued by reputable insurance companies), which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree that is not promptly stayed; (6) the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Subsidiaries that together (determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required by Section 5.04) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law: (a) commences proceedings to be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent; (b) consents to the institution of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under applicable Bankruptcy Law; (c) consents to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of it or for all or substantially all of its property; (d) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or (e) generally is not paying its debts as they become due; (7) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that: (a) is for relief against the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Subsidiaries that together (determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) in a proceeding in which the Issuer or any such Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any such group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, is to be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent; (b) appoints a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Subsidiaries that together (determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), or for all or substantially all of the property of the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Subsidiaries that together (determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required by Section 5.04) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary); (c) orders the liquidation of the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Subsidiaries that together (determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary); and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days. If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) or (7) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is 124 Table of Contents actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must mail to each Holder of Notes notice of the Default within 90 days after it is known to the Trustee. The Indenture provides that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it in good faith determines that withholding notice is in their interest. If the Notes are accelerated or otherwise become due prior to the stated maturity, in each case, as a result of an Event of Default, the amount of principal of, accrued and unpaid interest and premium on the Notes that becomes due and payable shall equal 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes on the date of such acceleration, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration and its consequences with respect to the Notes. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense in relation to such exercise. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have made a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Notes have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense in relation to such Holder's pursuit of such remedy; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Indenture provides that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within five Business Days, upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default. No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders To the extent permitted by law, no director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or stockholder of the Issuer or any of their parent companies or entities shall have any liability for any 125 Table of Contents obligations of the Issuer under the Notes or this Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting Notes waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance The obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Security Documents will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released upon payment in full of all of the Notes. The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the Notes ("Legal Defeasance") and cure all then existing Events of Default except for: (1) the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the Indenture; (2) the Issuer's obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust; (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer's obligations in connection therewith; and (4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture. In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are described in the Indenture ("Covenant Defeasance") and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Issuer) described under "Events of Default and Remedies" will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes: (1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on the Notes on the stated maturity date or, if the Notes have been or will be called for redemption in accordance with this Indenture, on the relevant redemption date and the Issuer must specify whether such Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date; (2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, (a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (b) since the issuance of the Notes, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same 126 Table of Contents manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred; (3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to such tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred; (4) no Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness, and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit; (5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which the Issuer is a party or by which the Issuer is bound (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to the discharge of such agreement or instrument and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith); (6) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer or others; and (7) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. After an amendment under the Indenture becomes effective, we are required to mail to Holders of the Notes a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Holders of the Notes (or any defect in such notice), however, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment. Neither the Issuer nor any Affiliate of the Issuer may, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any Holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes, unless such consideration is offered to all Holders and is paid to all Holders that so consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or amendment; provided that, in connection with any consideration to be paid to Holders in an exchange offer in respect of Notes that are not registered under the Securities Act, such consideration need not be paid to Holders who, upon request, do not confirm they are "qualified institutional 129 Table of Contents buyers" within the meaning of Rule 144A of the Securities Act or, in the case of non-U.S. Holders who, upon request, do not confirm they are non-U.S. persons within the meaning of Regulation S of the Securities Act.

Concerning the Trustee The Indenture contains certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Trustee. The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that at all times that an Event of Default is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder of the Notes, unless such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense with respect to such exercise.

We have also audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Community Choice Financial, Inc. and its Subsidiaries (the Predecessor Company) as of December 31, 2017, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the period January 1, 2018 through December 12, 2018 and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the Predecessor financial statements). In our opinion, the Successor financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Successor Company as of December 31, 2018 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period December 13, 2018 (inception) through December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the Predecessor financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Predecessor Company as of December 31, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period January 1, 2018 through December 12, 2018 and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Predecessor Company's and Successor Company's (collectively, the Company's) management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ RSM US LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 2006.

Ownership, Nature of Business, and Significant Accounting Policies Nature of business: CCF Holdings, LLC (the "Company" or "CCF") is a provider of alternative financial services to unbanked and under-banked consumers. The Company was formed in 2018 and began operations upon the closing of the Restructuring (as described below). As a result of the Restructuring, the Company succeeded to the business and operations of Community Choice Financial Inc., which we refer to as our Predecessor. The Company owned and operated 471 retail locations in 12 states and was licensed to deliver similar financial services over the internet in 29 states as of December 31, 2018. Through its network of retail locations and over the internet, the Company provides customers a variety of financial products and services, including secured and unsecured, short-term and medium-term consumer loans, check cashing, prepaid debit cards, and other services that address the specific needs of its individual customers. As an "emerging growth company," the Company is permitted to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has chosen to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. The 2018 Restructuring On December 12, 2018, the Predecessor entered into an agreement (the "Restructuring Agreement"), with (a) CCF OpCo LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("CCF OpCo"), (b) the Company, (c) CCF Intermediate Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("CCF Intermediate"), (d) certain of Predecessor's direct and indirect subsidiaries, (e) certain noteholders under (i) the Indenture, dated as of April 29, 2011 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the "2019 Indenture"), by and among the Predecessor, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. and Computershare Trust Company of Canada, together as indenture trustee (the "Indenture Trustee"), and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as collateral agent (in such capacity, the "Collateral Agent") governing Predecessor's 10.75% senior secured notes due May 1, 2019 (the "2019 Notes"), (ii) the Indenture, dated as of July 6, 2012 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the "2020 Indenture", and together with the 2019 Indenture, the "Existing Indentures"), by and among Predecessor, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, the Indenture Trustee and the Collateral Agent, governing Predecessor's 12.75% senior secured notes due May 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"), and (iii) the Indenture, dated as of September 6, 2018 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the "SPV Indenture"), by and among Community Choice Financial Issuer, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("CCF Issuer"), the guarantor party thereto, and Computershare Trust Company, N.A, as indenture trustee (in such capacity, the "SPV Trustee") and collateral agent (in such capacity, the "SPV Collateral Agent") governing CCF Issuer's 9.00% senior secured notes due September 6, 2020 (the "Secured Notes"), (f) certain investment funds associated with Diamond Castle Holdings and Golden Gate Capital (each, a "Sponsor," and collectively, the "Sponsors") and (g) CCF Issuer as revolving lender (the "Revolving Lender") under the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 6, 2018 (as amended, modified, supplemented, or otherwise restated from time to time, the "Revolving Credit Agreement"), by and among CCF OpCo, CCF Intermediate, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, GLAS Trust Company LLC as administrative agent, and the Revolving Lender. F-9 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1. Ownership, Nature of Business, and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Substantially concurrent with the execution and delivery of, and pursuant to, the Restructuring Agreement, on December 12, 2018 (the "Closing Date") the Predecessor consummated a number of transactions contemplated thereby (the "Restructuring"), which satisfied Predecessor's obligation to execute a Deleveraging Transaction (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) as required under the Victory Park Revolver and the SPV Indenture. The Deleveraging Transaction was effected by way of an out-of-court strict foreclosure transaction, pursuant to which the Collateral Agent under the Existing Indentures, acting at the direction of certain beneficial holders holding more than 50% of the 2019 Notes and the beneficial holders of 100% of the 2020 Notes, exercised remedies whereby all right, title and interest in and to all of the assets of the Company that constitute collateral with respect to the Existing Indentures, including the issued and outstanding equity interests in certain of the Company's direct subsidiaries, were transferred to CCF OpCo. CCF OpCo is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the strict foreclosure, all obligations represented by the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes were extinguished, and holders of the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes received a pro rata share of $276.9 million of the newly-issued 10.750% Senior PIK Notes due 2023 (the "PIK Notes") and 850,000 Class A common units of limited liability company interest ("Class A Units") issued by the Company. Additionally, the holders of Secured Notes received their pro rata share of 150,000 Class B common units of limited liability company interest ("Class B Units") issued by the Company, and Predecessor's existing equity holders, including the Sponsors, are entitled to receive a pro rata share of up to 52,631.6 of the Company's Class C common units of limited liability company interest ("Class C Common Units"). Furthermore, we may in the future issue Class M common units of limited liability company interest ("Class M Common Units" and together with Class A Common Units, Class B Common Units and Class C Common Units, the "Common Units") pursuant to an equity incentive plan. In connection with the Restructuring, the SPV Indenture was amended and restated to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the Secured Notes from September 6, 2020 to June 15, 2023. The Class A Common Units and Class B Common Units (which Class B Common Units represented 15.0% of the aggregate number of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Units on December 12, 2018, subject to adjustment for any future issuances of common units (i) in consideration for the redemption of the PIK Notes ("Redemption Units"), or (ii) in connection with the issuance of any additional debt securities ("Additional Financing Units"), such that they continue to represent 15.0% of the issued and outstanding Common Units (including such Redemption Units and Additional Financing Units, but subject to dilution from any new management equity plan)) will entitle the holders thereof to voting rights (in each case, subject to the limitations in the governing documents of the Company). Following the Class C Distribution Trigger Time, Class C Common Units will be entitled to up to 5.0% of distributions from the Company. The Class C Common Units shall be subject to dilution from any new management equity plan and other common units and other equity interests of the Company that may be issued after the effective date of the Deleveraging Transaction. In addition, in connection with the Restructuring, CCFI Funding II LLC, a non-guarantor subsidiary of CCF OpCo, entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of April 25, 2017 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the "Ivy Credit Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, our borrowings under the Ivy Credit Agreement were increased from $63,500 to $70,000 F-10 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1. Ownership, Nature of Business, and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) A summary of the Company's significant accounting policies follows: Basis of presentation: Upon the effective date of the Restructuring, the Company applied business combination accounting which resulted in the creation of a new entity for financial reporting purposes. As a result of the application of business combination accounting, as well as the effects of the implementation of the Restructuring, the Consolidated Financial Statements on or after December 12, 2018 being not comparable with the Consolidated Financial Statements prior to that date. Refer to Note 14. Business Combinations for a discussion of the Restructuring and the related impact of business combination accounting on the consolidated financial statements. The Company's financial condition as of December 31, 2018 reflects the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. Due to the timing of the Restructuring, the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflect the results of operations of the Predecessor for the period prior to December 12, 2018, and the Company's consolidated results for the period from December 12, 2018 through December 31, 2018. The Company's financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 reflects the financial condition and results of operations of the Predecessor. References to "Successor" or "Successor Company" relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to December 12, 2018. References to "Predecessor" or "Predecessor Company" refer to the financial position and results of operations of Community Choice Financial Inc. on and before December 12, 2018. Business combinations: The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and any assumed liabilities are recorded at their acquisition date estimated fair value. The excess of purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed represents the goodwill amount resulting from the Restructuring. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Basis of consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CCF. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of goodwill, the value of stock based compensation and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Business Segments: FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 280 requires that a public enterprise report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain specific revenue and expense items, segment assets, information about the way operating segments were determined and other items. The Company reports operating segments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 280. Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that F-11 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1. Ownership, Nature of Business, and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company operates in two segments: Retail financial services and Internet financial services. Equity method investments: Entities and investments over which the Company exercises significant influence over the activities of the entity but which do not meet the requirements for consolidation are accounted for using the equity method of accounting pursuant to ASC 323, whereby the Company records its share of the underlying income or loss of these entities. Intercompany profit arising from transactions with affiliates is eliminated to the extent of its beneficial interest. Equity in losses of equity method investments is not recognized after the carrying value of an investment, including advances and loans, has been reduced to zero, unless guarantees or other funding obligations exist. On September 30, 2017, the Predecessor entered into a joint venture with a third party to offer insurance products through select retail locations in a certain market. The third party manages the joint venture. Revenue recognition: Transactions include loans, credit service fees, check cashing, bill payment, money transfer, money order sales, and other miscellaneous products and services. The recognized revenue from these transactions is classified in the following categories: Finance receivables feesAdvance fees and direct costs incurred for the origination of secured and unsecured short-term and medium-term consumer loans are deferred and amortized over the loan period using the interest method. Revenue on loans determined to be troubled debt restructurings are recognized at the impaired loans' original interest rates until the impaired loans are charged off or paid by the customer. Revenues from short-term and medium-term consumer loans are recognized and the performance obligation is satisfied over the term of the loan. Credit service feesCredit service organization ("CSO") fees are recognized over the arranged credit service period. ASC 606 requires product sales to be allocated based on performance obligation. CSO performance obligations include the guarantee and the arrangement of the loan. The guarantee portion of the fees are recognized over the period of the loan as the guarantee represents the primary performance obligation. The arrangement of the loan represents a small portion of the CSO fee, and the net impact resulting from the adoption of ASC 606 for this portion of the loan would not be material. Credit service fees are recognized and the performance obligation is satisfied over the term of the related loan. Check cashing feesThe full amount of the check cashing fee is recognized as revenue at the time of the transaction. The revenue is recognized and the performance obligation is satisfied at the time the service is provided. Card fees and OtherThe Company acts in an agency capacity regarding bill payment services, money transfers, card products, and money orders offered and sold at its retail locations. The Company records the net amount retained as revenue because the supplier is the primary obligor in the arrangement, the amount earned by the Company is fixed, and the supplier is determined to have the ultimate credit risk. The revenue is recognized and the performance obligation is satisfied at the time the service is provided. F-12 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1. Ownership, Nature of Business, and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Disaggregation of revenuesRevenues for finance receivable and credit service fees are recognized over the term of the loan and were $15,394 and $260,776 for the Successor and Predecessor periods of 2018, respectively. Revenues for check cashing and card fees, and other are recognized at the time of service and were $3,586 and $$66,482 for the Successor and Predecessor periods of 2018, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. At times, the Company may maintain deposits with banks in amounts in excess of federal depository insurance limits, but believes any such amounts do not represent significant credit risk. Restricted cash: Restricted cash represents cash used to meet state licensing requirements or compensating balances, and is restricted as to withdrawal or usage. Finance receivables: Finance receivables consist of short term and medium-term consumer loans. Short-term consumer loans can be unsecured or secured with a maturity up to ninety days. Unsecured short-term loan products typically range in principal from $100 to $1,000, with a maturity between fourteen and thirty days, and include a written agreement to defer the presentment of the customer's personal check or preauthorized debit for the aggregate amount of the advance plus fees. This form of lending is based on applicable laws and regulations which vary by state. State statutes vary from charging fees of 15% to 20%, to charging interest at 25% per annum plus origination fees. The customers repay the cash advance by making cash payments or allowing a check or preauthorized debit to be presented. Secured consumer loans with a maturity of ninety days or less are included in this category and represented 12.8% and 14.5% of short-term consumer loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In certain states, in compliance with law, we offer an extended payment plan for all borrowers. This extended payment plan is advertised to all customers where the program is offered, either via pamphlet or by being posted at the store at the time of the consumer loan. This payment plan is available to all customers in these states upon request and is not contingent on the borrower's repayment status or further underwriting standards. The term is extended to roughly four payments over eight weeks. If customers do not make these payments, then their held check is deposited. Gross loan receivables subject to these repayment plans represented $135 of the $89,808 total receivables at December 31, 2018 and $184 of the $113,368 total receivables at December 31, 2017. Medium-term consumer loans can be unsecured or secured with a maturity greater than ninety days and up to thirty-six months. Unsecured medium-term products typically range from $100 to $5,000, and are evidenced by a promissory note with a maturity between three and thirty-six months. These consumer loans vary in structure depending upon the applicable laws and regulations where they are offered. The medium-term consumer loans are payable in installments or provide for a line of credit with periodic payments. Secured consumer loans with a maturity greater than ninety days represented 13.7% and 12.6% of medium-term consumer loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Allowance for loan losses: Provisions for loan losses are charged to income in amounts sufficient to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses and an adequate accrual for losses related to guaranteed loans processed for third-party lenders under the CSO program. The factors used in assessing the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the accrual for losses related to F-13 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1. Ownership, Nature of Business, and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) guaranteed loans made by third-party lenders and the resulting provision for loan losses include an evaluation by product, by market based on historical loan loss experience, and delinquency of certain medium-term consumer loans. The Company evaluates various qualitative factors that may or may not affect the computed initial estimate of the allowance for loan losses, by using internal valuation inputs including historical loan loss experience, delinquency, overall portfolio quality, and current economic conditions. For short term unsecured consumer loans, the Company's policy is to charge off loans when they become past due. The Company's policy dictates that, where a customer has provided a check or ACH authorization for presentment upon the maturity of a loan, if the customer has not paid off the loan by the due date, the Company will deposit the customer's check or draft the customer's bank account for the amount due. If the check or draft is returned as unpaid, all accrued fees and outstanding principal are charged-off as uncollectible. For short term secured loans, the Company's policy requires that balances be charged off when accounts are either thirty or sixty days past due depending on the product. The Company accrues interest on past-due loans until charge off. As a result, the Company did not have any nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. The amount of the resulting charge-off includes unpaid principal, accrued interest and any uncollected fees, if applicable. For medium term secured and unsecured consumer loans that have a term of one year or less, the Company's policy requires that balances be charged off when accounts are sixty days past due. For medium term secured and unsecured consumer loans that have an initial maturity of greater than one year, the Company's policy requires that balances be charged off when accounts are ninety-one days past due. The Company accrues interest on past-due loans until charge off. The amount of the resulting charge-off includes unpaid principal, accrued interest and any uncollected fees, if applicable. In certain markets, the Company reduced interest rates and favorably changed payment terms for medium-term consumer loans to assist borrowers in avoiding default and to mitigate risk of loss. These reduced interest rates and changed payment terms were limited to loans that the Company believed the customer had the ability to pay in the foreseeable future. These loans were accounted for as troubled debt restructurings and represent the only loans considered impaired due to the nature of the Company's charge-off policy. Recoveries of amounts previously charged off are recorded to the allowance for loan losses or the accrual for third-party losses in the period in which they are received. Card related pre-funding and receivables: The Company acts as an agent for Insight, marketing prepaid debit cards. Property, leasehold improvements and equipment: Leasehold improvements and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided principally by straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term, whichever is shorter. In connection with the Restructuring on December 12, 2018, the estimated fair value of property, leasehold improvements and equipment was determined using a market approach and a cost replacement approach. F-14 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1. Ownership, Nature of Business, and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The useful lives of leasehold improvements and equipment by class are as follows: Years Furniture & fixtures 7 Leasehold improvements Life of Lease Equipment 3 - 7 Vehicles 5 Capital leases & maintenance Life of Lease Buildings 39 Deferred loan origination costs: Direct costs incurred for the origination of loans, which consist mainly of direct and employee-related costs, are deferred and amortized to loan fee income over the contractual lives of the loans using the interest method. Unamortized amounts are recognized as income at the time that loans are paid in full. Goodwill and other intangible assets: Goodwill, or cost in excess of fair value of net assets of the companies acquired, is recorded at its carrying value and is periodically evaluated for impairment. Goodwill in the Successor period represents amounts recognized in connection with the Restructuring on December 12, 2018. The Company tests the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets annually as of December 31 or when the events and circumstances warrant such a review. One of the methods for this review is performed using estimates of future cash flows. If the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible assets exceeds its fair value. Changes in estimates of cash flows and fair value, however, could affect the valuation. On July 1, 2016, the Predecessor entered into a swap transaction through which it divested interests in Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, and Utah, as described in Note 14. The Predecessor provided a version of a new projection model which was based on the potential effects of proposed CFPB rules as the Predecessor understood the impact at that time. The methodology for determining the fair value was a combination of quoted market prices, prices of comparable businesses, discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques. These items are considered level 3 inputs for determining fair value. The test concluded that the Retail financial services reporting unit had an impairment of $28,949 as of July 1, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Predecessor conducted its annual test for impairment of goodwill for the Retail financial services reporting unit and concluded that there was no impairment for the Retail services reporting unit. The methodology for determining the fair value was a combination of quoted market prices, prices of comparable businesses, discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Predecessor conducted its annual test for impairment of goodwill for the Retail financial services reporting unit and concluded that an impairment for the Retail services reporting unit of $113,753 should be taken. The methodology for determining the fair value was a combination of quoted market prices, prices of comparable businesses, discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques. Goodwill for the Retail financial services reporting unit was fully impaired as of December 31, 2017. F-15 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1. Ownership, Nature of Business, and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) In connection with the Restructuring on December 12, 2018, the Company recognized goodwill and other intangible assets of $14,451. The Company's other intangible assets consist of non-compete agreements, customer lists, trade names, and internally developed software. The amounts recorded for other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over three, five, or seven years. Intangible amortization expense for the Successor period ended December 31, 2018 was $23, and for the Predecessor period ended December 12, 2018, and for the Predecessor years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016 was $630, $496 and $664, respectively Deferred debt issuance costs: Deferred debt issuance costs are amortized using the interest method over the life of the related note payable agreement. Amortization is included as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Deferred revenue: The Company's deferred revenue is comprised of an upfront fee received under an agency agreement to offer wire transfer services at the Company's branches. The deferred revenue is recognized over the contract period on a straight-line basis. Deferred rent: The Company leases premises under agreements which provide for periodic increases over the lease term. Accordingly, timing differences between the amount paid for rent and the amount expensed under the straight line method, are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Lease Termination Payable: The Company records a liability in the consolidated balance sheets for the remaining lease obligations with the corresponding lease termination expense for closed retail locations disclosed in the operating expenses section, and closed corporate locations disclosed in the corporate and other expenses section, of the consolidated statements of operations, respectively. Self-Insurance Liability: The Company is self-insured for employee medical benefits subject to certain loss limitations. The incurred but not reported liability ("IBNR") represents an estimate of the cost of unreported claims based on historical claims reporting. The Company monitors the continued reasonableness of the assumptions and methods used to estimate the IBNR liability each reporting period. Advertising and marketing costs: Costs incurred for producing and communicating advertising, and marketing over the internet are charged to operations when incurred or the first time advertising takes place. Advertising and marketing expense for the Successor period ended December 31, 2018 was $95, and for the Predecessor period ended December 12, 2018 and for the Predecessor years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016 were $4,643, $7,262 and $6,831, respectively. Corporate level advertising and marketing expense for the Successor period ended December 31, 2018 was $11, and for the Predecessor period ended December 12, 2018, and for the Predecessor years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $116, $291, and $447, respectively. F-16 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1. Ownership, Nature of Business, and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Operating expenses: The direct costs incurred in operating the Company's store and call center operations have been classified as operating expenses. Operating expenses include salaries and benefits of employees, provision for loan losses, rent and other occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization of branch property and equipment, armored services and security costs, and other direct costs. District and regional managers' salaries are included in corporate expenses. Preopening costs: New store preopening costs are expensed as incurred. Impairment of long-lived assets: The Company evaluates all long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of these assets cannot be recovered by the undiscounted net cash flows they will generate. Income taxes: Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Income tax expense represents current tax obligations and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties on income taxes are charged to income tax expense. Governmental regulation: The Company is subject to various state and federal laws and regulations, which are subject to change and which may impose significant costs or limitations on the way the Company conducts or expands its business. Certain limitations include among other things imposed limits on fee rates and other charges, the number of loans to a customer, a cooling off period, the number of permitted rollovers and required licensing and qualification. In most instances, state law provides the statutory and regulatory framework for the products the Company offers in those states, in instances where the Company is making a loan to a consumer, certain federal laws also impact the business. The Company's consumer loans are subject to federal laws and regulations, including the Truth-in-Lending Act ("TILA"), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ("ECOA"), the Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA"), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA"), the Bank Secrecy Act, the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994, and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (the "PATRIOT Act"), Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank"), and the regulations promulgated for each. Among other things, these laws require disclosure of the principal terms of each transaction to every customer, prohibit misleading advertising, protect against discriminatory lending practices, proscribe unfair credit practices and prohibit creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, sex, age or marital status. The GLBA and its implementing regulations generally F-17 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1. Ownership, Nature of Business, and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) require the Company to protect the confidentiality of its customers' nonpublic personal information and to disclose to the Company's customers its privacy policy and practices. On October 5, 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") released its final Payday, Vehicle Title and Certain High-Cost Installment Loan Rules ("CFPB Rule"). The CFPB Rule was published in the Federal Register on November 17, 2017, prior to the resignation of the CFPB's Director. On February 6, 2019, however, the CFPB proposed to rescind certain provisions of the CFPB Rule, specifically to repeal the portion of the rule that included an ability-to-repay requirement, which the CFPB now refers to as the "mandatory underwriting provisions," and to delay the compliance date for the mandatory underwriting provisions until November 19, 2020. In addition to state regulatory examinations that assess the Company's compliance with state and federal laws and regulations, the CFPB and the Internal Revenue Service periodically examine and will continue to periodically examine the Company's compliance with the federal laws noted above and the regulations promulgated under those laws. Fair value of financial instruments: Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are grouped in three levels. The levels prioritize the inputs used to measure the fair value of the assets or liabilities. These levels are:  Level 1Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for assets and liabilities, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are less attractive.  Level 3Unobservable inputs for assets and liabilities reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions. The Company follows the provisions of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which applies to all assets and liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis. ASC 820-10 requires a disclosure that establishes a framework for measuring fair value within GAAP and expands the disclosure about fair value measurements. This standard enables a reader of consolidated financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The standard requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the three categories. In determining the appropriate levels, the Company performed a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities that are subject to ASC 820-10. At each reporting period, all assets and liabilities for which the fair value measurement is based on significant unobservable inputs are classified as Level 3. The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, finance receivables, short-term investments, and lines of credit. For all such instruments, other than notes payable at December 31, 2018, and senior secured notes at December 31, 2017, the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements approximate their fair values. Finance receivables are short term in nature and are originated at prevailing market rates and lines of credit bear interest at current market rates. The fair value of finance receivables at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 approximates carrying value and is measured using internal valuation inputs including historical loan loss experience, delinquency, overall portfolio quality, and current economic conditions. F-18 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1. Ownership, Nature of Business, and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The fair value of the PIK notes was determined at the date of issuance of December 12, 2018, and at December 31, 2018. As more fully described in Note 6, the fair value of the PIK notes was determined using an approach that considered both a Black Scholes option price methodology and the intrinsic value of the notes on an "as-if-converted" basis. The fair value of the 10.75% senior secured notes due 2019 (the "2019 notes") and the 12.75% senior secured notes due 2020 (the "2020 notes") were determined based on market yield on trades of the 2019 notes at the end of the year ended December 31, 2017.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that F-19 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1. Ownership, Nature of Business, and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective retrospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. This ASU was amended in August 2015 by ASU 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date", which defers the effective date by one year. In addition, between March 2016 and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) ("ASU 2016-08"), ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ("ASU 2016-10") and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients ("ASU 2016-12"). ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 clarify certain aspects of ASU 2014-09 and provide additional implementation guidance. For emerging growth companies, ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company elected to early adopt the standard and determined that the primary revenue source impacted by this standard are the credit service organization fees. Credit service organization ("CSO") fees are recognized over the arranged credit service period. ASC 606 requires product sales to be allocated based on performance obligation. CSO performance obligations include the guarantee and the arrangement of the loan. The guarantee portion of the fees are recognized over the period of the loan as the guarantee represents the primary performance obligation. The arrangement of the loan represents a small portion of the CSO fee, and the net impact resulting from the adoption of ASC 606 for this portion of the loan is not material. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Financial InstrumentsOverall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" , which requires that equity investments, except for those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation of the investee, be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. ASU 2016-01 also impacts the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for emerging growth companies for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company elected to early adopt the standard and the early adoption of ASU 2016-01 has not had a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)", which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize the following for all leases with terms longer than 12 months: (a) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (b) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Leases will be classified F-20 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1. Ownership, Nature of Business, and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similarly to existing guidance for operating leases today. In addition, ASU 2016-02 aligns lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Section ASummary and Amendments That Create Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Other Assets and Deferred CostsContracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40) ("ASU 2014-09"). ASU 2016-02 is effective for emerging growth companies for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company has elected to early adopt the standard for the year ending December 31, 2019. Entities must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. As a result of the adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019, the Company recorded $32,453 for both operating lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets. The operating lease liabilities will be based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments using discount rates as of the effective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "CompensationStock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" , which simplifies several aspects related to the accounting for share-based payment transactions. Per ASU 2016-09: (1) all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, rather than in additional paid-in capital under current guidance; (2) excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows, rather than as a separate cash inflow from financing activities and cash outflow from operating activities under current guidance; (3) cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity; and (4) an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest, which is consistent with current guidance, or account for forfeitures when they occur. For emerging growth companies, the guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company determined that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 does not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts. Entities will now use forward-looking information to better form their credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for emerging growth companies that are Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filers for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is still assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, "Restricted Cash" . GAAP currently does not include specific guidance to address how to classify and present changes in restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents that occur when there are transfers between cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents and when there are direct cash receipts into restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents or direct cash payments made from restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The amendments in this Update require that a statement of cash flows explain the change F-21 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1. Ownership, Nature of Business, and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this Update do not provide a definition of restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. For emerging growth companies, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2019. The Company elected to early adopt the standard and has revised the format of the statement of cash flows to reflect the requirements of this standard. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, "Business Combinations (Topic805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business". This guidance clarifies the definition of a business, which affects many areas of accounting, such as acquisitions, disposals, goodwill impairment and consolidation. For emerging growth companies, the guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2017-01 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, "IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment". This guidance eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Any impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill. This guidance also eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment, and if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. This guidance is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 for emerging growth companies. The Company has elected to not early adopt the provisions of ASU 2017-04. If early adoption had been selected, the goodwill impairment recorded and analysis performed at December 31, 2017 would have been materially different given the reporting unit had negative carrying value. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, "CompensationStock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting". This guidance specifies which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The guidance is effective for all entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company has determined that adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Subsequent events: The Company has evaluated its subsequent events (events occurring after December 31, 2018) through the issuance date of April 7, 2019.

Total gross finance receivables for which the Company has recorded an accrual for third-party lender losses totaled $34,144 and $36,967 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the corresponding guaranteed consumer loans are disclosed as an off-balance sheet arrangement. The total gross finance receivables for the Ohio CSO product consist of $30,490 and $31,341 in short-term and $303 and $1,166 in installment loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The total gross finance receivables for the Texas CSO product consist of $3,351 and $4,460 in short-term loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The provision for third-party lender losses of $24,258 and $32,666 for the Predecessor period ended December 12, 2018 and the Predecessor year ended December 31, 2017 is net of debt sales of $934 and $988, respectively. For the Ohio CSO Program, the Company was required to purchase $2,082, $46,368, and $43,584 of short-term and $17, $669, and $638 of installment loans during the Successor period ended December 31, 2018, Predecessor period ended December 12, 2018, and the Predecessor year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. As these loans were in default when purchased, they met the Company's policy and were fully charged-off at acquisition. The Company recognized recoveries of $1,216, $29,912, and $23,557 of short-term and $19, $270, and $305 of installment collections on these loans during the Successor period ended December 31, 2018, Predecessor period ended December 12, 2018, and the Predecessor year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. For the Texas CSO Program, the Company was required to purchase $485, $11,293, and $17,542 of short-term loans during the Successor period ended December 31, 2018, Predecessor period ended December 12, 2018, and the Predecessor year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. As these loans were in default when purchased, they met the Company's policy and were fully charged-off at acquisition. The Company recognized recoveries of $270, $4,123, and $6,888 of short-term collections on these loans during the Successor period ended December 31, 2018, Predecessor period ended December 12, 2018, and the Predecessor year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. The Company considers the near term repayment performance of finance receivables as its primary credit quality indicator. The Company performs credit checks through consumer reporting agencies on certain borrowers.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (Continued) In connection with the Restructuring, the Company recorded $11,288 in goodwill and $3,163 in intangible assets representing the fair values at the Restructuring date of December 12, 2018. See Note 14 for additional information regarding the Restructuring. The carrying amounts of goodwill by reportable segment at December 31, 2018 were as follows: Retail Financial Services Internet Financial Services Total Goodwill $ 11,288 $  $ 11,288 Accumulated impairment losses    ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 11,288 $  $ 11,288 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are summarized as follows: Predecessor Balance at December 31, 2015 $ 152,568 Other acquisitions and dispositions, net (10,329 ) Retail segment impairment (28,949 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2016 113,290 Other acquisitions, net 463 Retail segment impairment (113,753 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2017  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 12, 2018 $  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Successor Balance at December 13, 2018 $  Goodwill recognized in restructuring 11,288 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 11,288 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ For the Predecessor years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company conducted its annual test for impairment of goodwill for the Retail financial services reporting unit and concluded that an impairment for the Retail services reporting unit of $113,753, and $-0-, respectively, should be taken. The methodology for determining the fair value was a combination of quoted market prices, prices of comparable businesses, discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques. Goodwill for the Retail financial services reporting unit was fully impaired as of December 31, 2017. The Predecessor performs a goodwill impairment test for the Retail services reporting unit as required when a portion of a segment is sold. The Predecessor sold its interests in Buckeye Check Cashing of Florida II ("Florida II") in February 2016 as described in Note 14. The test resulted in no impairment of goodwill. On July 1, 2016, the Predecessor entered in to a swap transaction through which it divested interests in Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, and Utah, as described in Note 14. In June 2016, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published its notice of proposed rule-making on payday, vehicle title and F-29 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (Continued) certain high-cost installment loans which will restrict the Company's ability to lend to consumers. At this time, we are unable to predict what the final version of these rules will be or their impact on our business. The Predecessor provided a version of a new projection model which was based on the potential effects of these rules as the Predecessor understood the impact at this time. The methodology for determining the fair value was a combination of quoted market prices, prices of comparable businesses, discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques. These items are considered level 3 inputs for determining fair value. The test concluded that the Retail financial services reporting unit had an impairment of $28,949 as of July 1, 2016. The amount of book goodwill from the acquisition of California Check Cashing Services in 2011 exceeded the amount of tax goodwill by approximately $46,775.

Note 6. Pledged Assets and Debt Concurrent with the execution and delivery of, and pursuant to, the Restructuring Agreement, on December 12, 2018, our Predecessor consummated a number of transactions contemplated thereby, which satisfied Predecessor's obligation to execute a Deleveraging Transaction as required under the Victory Park Revolver and the SPV Indenture. F-30 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 6. Pledged Assets and Debt (Continued) The Deleveraging Transaction was effected by way of an out-of-court strict foreclosure transaction, pursuant to which the Collateral Agent under the Existing Indentures, acting at the direction of certain beneficial holders holding more than 50% of the 2019 Notes and the beneficial holders of 100% of the 2020 Notes, exercised remedies whereby all right, title and interest in and to all of the assets of the Predecessor that constitute collateral with respect to the Existing Indentures, including the issued and outstanding equity interests in certain of the Predecessor's direct subsidiaries, were transferred to CCF OpCo. CCF OpCo is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the strict foreclosure, all obligations represented by the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes were extinguished, and holders of the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes received a pro rata share of $276,940 of the newly-issued 10.750% PIK Notes due 2023. Senior PIK notes payable at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 consisted of the following: December 31, 2018 Successor December 31, 2017 Predecessor Principal Discount Fair Value Principal Principal Senior PIK notes, 10.750% interest payable in-kind, due December 2023 $ 276,940 $ 216,144 $ 60,796 $  $  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 276,940 216,144 60,796   Less current maturities      ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Long-term portion $ 276,940 $ 216,144 $ 60,796 $  $  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ As a result of the Restructuring and application of business combination accounting, all of the Company's debt obligations were initially recognized at fair value at December 13, 2018. The Company has elected to apply the fair value option to the PIK Notes, which results in the notes being carried at fair value in the 2018 Successor period and future years. The Company elected the fair value option for the PIK Notes because the notes were initially recognized at a significant discount, all subsequent interest will be paid-in kind rather than in cash, and management expects it to be likely that the notes will be converted to equity upon maturity. For these reasons, management believes reporting the PIK Notes at fair value provides better information to the users of the Company's financial statements. The fair value option was not elected for the Company's other debt obligations because they do not have the same characteristics as the PIK Notes. The fair value of the PIK Notes was determined using an approach that considered both a Black Scholes option price methodology and the intrinsic value of the notes on an "as-if-converted" basis. This approach was selected because the PIK Notes are expected to be converted to equity upon F-31 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 6. Pledged Assets and Debt (Continued) redemption and the face value of the PIK Notes is greater than the enterprise value of the Company. Significant assumptions used in the Black Scholes option price methodology include the following: December 12, 2018 December 31, 2018 Risk-free interest rate 2.77 % 2.51 % Dividend yield 0.00 % 0.00 % Expected volatility 38.70 % 38.90 % Expected term (years) 5.00 4.95 The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield on 5-year Treasury bonds, and the expected volatility was determined using the guideline public company method. The expected term is based on when management expects the PIK Notes to be redeemed for equity. The intrinsic value at each measurement date is based on the estimated enterprise value adjusted for net debt, and assumes a redemption of all outstanding PIK Notes at that time. An average of the allocated value from the Black Scholes option price methodology and the intrinsic value is used to estimate fair value at each measurement date. The fair value of the PIK Notes upon their issuance resulted in $209,509 in fair value discount. This amount is not reflected in either the Predecessor or Successor consolidated statement of operations. The change in the fair value of the PIK Notes during the Successor period or $6,635 has been recognized in other comprehensive income as the entire change in fair value is attributable to the instrument-specific credit risk of the PIK Notes. In the future, we expect to measure the fair value of the PIK Notes on a quarterly basis using a similar methodology, unless there is a quoted market price that can be used instead. Interest on the PIK Notes accrues at the rate of 10.750% per annum and is payable by increasing the principal amount of the PIK Notes. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears for the prior six month period on June 15 and December 15 to the Holders of PIK Notes of record on the immediately preceding June 1 and December 1. Interest on the PIK Notes is accrued and recorded as accrued interest until June 15 and December 15, at which time the accrual is released and the additional principal amount is recorded. Accrued interest for the PIK Notes at December 31, 2018 is $1,571 and is included as a current liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Pledged Assets and Debt (Continued) On September 6, 2018, the Predecessor completed a refinancing of its existing $47,000 revolving credit facility, with Victory Park Management, LLC ("VPC"), as administrative agent, and certain of VPC's affiliates as lenders (the "Existing Credit Facility"). The Predecessor recorded a loss related to the refinancing transaction composed of a prepayment penalty of $8,261 and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $2,571. The Predecessor entered into a $45,000 revolving credit agreement, dated as of September 6, 2018 (the "Revolving Credit Agreement"), with certain affiliates of VPC and Community Choice Financial Issuer, LLC, a wholly-owned, subsidiary of the Company ("CCF Issuer"). Proceeds from this facility were used, along with borrowings under the Amended Loan and Security Agreement described below, cash on hand and the issuance of New 2019 Notes described below to affiliates of VPC, for the termination and satisfaction in full of the Existing Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Agreement matures September 6, 2020, and bears interest at 9.00% per annum. Additionally, it has a make-whole provision and an unused commitment fee of 9.00% per annum, in each case, with respect to the $42,000 portion of the revolving credit facility held by CCF Issuer, which has been eliminated in consolidation. The Revolving Credit Agreement required a repayment to VPC of $3,000 on October 31, 2018 and required the Predecessor to execute a deleveraging transaction on or before November 30, 2018. The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains a cross-default to the existing Indentures, the New Secured Notes described below and the Amended Loan and Security Agreement described below. On December 12, 2018, in connection with the closing of the Restructuring, the Revolving Credit Agreement was simultaneously amended and restated. The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement allows for borrowings of up to $42,000 and has a maturity date of June 15, 2023. Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate of 9.00% per annum. All borrowings under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of CCF OpCo, CCF Intermediate Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, the sole member of CCF OpCo and our wholly owned subsidiary and certain of CCF OpCo's subsidiaries. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of CCF OpCo and is eliminated upon consolidation.

Pledged Assets and Debt (Continued) $42,000 of 9.00% senior secured notes due September 6, 2020 (the "New Secured Notes"). The New Secured Notes were issued as part of a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to certain significant holders of the Company's senior secured notes payable. The proceeds from the New Secured Notes were used to fund $42,000 in loans to the Company pursuant to the Revolving Credit Agreement described above. On December 12, 2018, in connection with the Restructuring, CCF Issuer issued an aggregate principal amount of $42,000 in Secured Notes to previous holders of Secured Notes. The Secured Notes bear interest at 9.00% per annum and mature on June 15, 2023. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated SPV Indenture, CCF Issuer and Community Choice Holdings each granted a pledge over all of their respective assets. CCF Issuer was also required to pledge its interests in the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement. The Amended and Restated SPV Indenture also contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or make other distributions or repurchase our capital stock or the capital stock of our subsidiaries, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, create liens or merge with or into other companies. The termination and issuance of Secured Notes, as part of the Restructuring, resulted in the elimination of the remaining deferred financing costs.

In connection with the amendment, the other non-guarantor and unrestricted subsidiary's, $7,300 note was satisfied in full. The September 6, 2018, amendment, among other things, increased the administrative fee to 1.2% per annum and increased the interest rate to 17.0% per annum on principal amounts over $60,000. The amendments allow for additional short term loans within the borrowing base and includes additional covenants addressing minimum cash and asset coverage tests, dividend limits, weekly operational reporting requirements, borrowing base reporting and a monthly consolidated EBITDA test. In addition, in connection with the Restructuring on December 12, 2018, CCFI Funding II LLC, a non-guarantor subsidiary of CCF OpCo, entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of April 25, 2017 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the "Ivy Credit Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, our borrowings under the Ivy Credit Agreement were increased from $63,500 to $70,000. The Restructuring, resulted in the elimination of the remaining deferred financing costs of the subsidiary notes. The Ivy Credit Agreement was amended on March 18, 2019 to extend the maturity date to April 30, 2020 and establish an interest rate of 16.75% on the entire credit facility. On July 19, 2014, a guarantor subsidiary of the Company entered in to a $1,425 term note with a non-related entity for the acquisition of a share of an airplane.

Note 11. Concentrations of Credit Risks The Company's portfolio of finance receivables is comprised of loan agreements with customers living in thirty-three states and consequently such customers' ability to honor their contracts may be affected by economic conditions in those states. Additionally, the Company is subject to regulation by federal and state governments that affect the products and services provided by the Company. To the extent that laws and regulations are passed that affect the Company's ability to offer loans or similar products in any of the states in which it operates, the Company's financial position could be adversely affected.

The Retail financial services segment includes Ohio, however, for the concentration of credit risks table, other retail segment states excludes Ohio as it offers a CSO product through a third-party lender. The other internet segment states are: Alabama, Alaska, California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The Company offers a CSO product in Ohio and Texas to assist consumers in obtaining credit with unaffiliated third-party lenders. Total gross finance receivables for which the Company has recorded an accrual for third-party lender losses totaled $34,144 and $36,967 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the corresponding guaranteed consumer loans are disclosed as an off-balance sheet arrangement. The total gross finance receivables for the Ohio CSO product consist of $30,490 and $31,341 in short-term and $303 and $1,166 in installment loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The total gross finance receivables for the Texas CSO product consist of $3,351 and $4,460 in short-term loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Note 12. Contingencies From time-to-time the Company is a defendant in various lawsuits and administrative proceedings wherein certain amounts are claimed or violations of law or regulations are asserted. In the opinion of the Company's management, these claims are without substantial merit and should not result in judgments which in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial statements. The State of Ohio assessed Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) for CCFI and certain subsidiaries. The assessment, which covered 2014 through 2016, totaled $274 including penalties and interest of $51. The F-40 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 12. Contingencies (Continued) Company believes there are substantive legal issues relating to certain amounts in the CAT assessment. As a result, the assessment was appealed and a hearing has been requested with the Taxpayer Appeals Division of the Ohio Department of Taxation. The hearing had not been scheduled as of the date of this Annual Report on Form S-1 and the outcome of the hearing cannot be reasonably estimated. If ultimately unsuccessful, the Company may be liable for the assessment, however, would also be eligible for refunds of up to $129 for FIT taxes for those years. Note 13. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has established a salary deferral plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan allows eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. Such deferrals accumulate on a tax deferred basis until the employee withdraws the funds. The Company has elected to match 100 percent of the employee contributions not exceeding 3 percent of compensation, plus 50 percent of the employee contributions exceeding 3 percent but not to exceed 5 percent of compensation. Total expense recorded for the Company's match was $120 for the Successor period ended December 31, 2018 and $1,401, $1,752, and $1,813 for the Predecessor period ended December 12, 2018, and the Predecessor years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Note 14. Business Combinations 2018 Restructuring On December 12, 2018, our Predecessor entered into the Restructuring Agreement. Substantially concurrent with the execution and delivery of, and pursuant to, the Restructuring Agreement, on December 12, 2018, Predecessor consummated a number of transactions contemplated thereby, which satisfied Predecessor's obligation to execute a Deleveraging Transaction as required under the Victory Park Revolver and the SPV Indenture. The Deleveraging Transaction was effected by way of an out-of-court strict foreclosure transaction, pursuant to which the Collateral Agent under the Existing Indentures were, acting at the direction of certain beneficial holders holding more than 50% of the 2019 Notes and the beneficial holders of 100% of the 2020 Notes, exercised remedies whereby all right, title and interest in and to all of the assets of the Predecessor that constitute collateral with respect to the Existing Indentures, including the issued and outstanding equity interests in certain of the Predecessor's direct subsidiaries, were transferred to CCF OpCo. CCF OpCo is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the CCF Holdings, LLC. Following the foreclosure on the assets of Predecessor, the Restructuring resulted in a change in control for the Company, and the impact of the Restructuring has been recognized in the Successor period of the company's financial statements. The strict foreclosure resulted in $6,941 in transaction costs, which were expensed in the Predecessor period ended December 12, 2018. For purposes of applying business combination accounting, the fair value of the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes extinguished of $68,301 is the consideration transferred for the equity interests in the acquired subsidiaries.

Florida II most recently operated forty-three stores in the South Florida market and was part of the Predecessor's Retail financial service operating segment. Florida II was an unrestricted subsidiary under the Predecessor's outstanding senior secured debt instruments. The consideration for the sale of Florida II included the following:  1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company held by Check Cashing USA Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of the Buyer, were assigned to the Predecessor and recorded as treasury stock of $50. In addition, stock repurchase rights associated with the shares were cancelled, resulting in the elimination of a stock repurchase obligation of $3,130.  The Predecessor was released from liability for two promissory notes totaling $10,112 that were incurred in connection with the Predecessor's original acquisition of Florida II (the "related party Florida seller notes"). F-42 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 14. Business Combinations (Continued) In connection with the sale, the Predecessor has also provided the Buyer with a short-term $6,000 line of credit, substantially all of which was drawn by the Buyer as part of, or concurrent with, the sale. As a result of uncertainties associated with repayment of the line of credit, the Predecessor also recognized a $3,000 loan loss reserve that has been included in the loss on sale of Florida II. The Predecessor recognized a pre-tax loss of $1,569 on the sale of Florida II, including the goodwill of $5,691 allocated to the Florida II transaction based on relative fair value. The difference between the pre-tax loss of $1,569 and tax loss of $24,062 on the sale of Florida II reflects the difference in GAAP and tax treatment of goodwill associated with an individual acquisition. On May 18, 2016, Buckeye Check Cashing of Florida, Inc. ("BCC Florida"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Predecessor, re-acquired five south Florida retail locations, previously owned by Florida II, from the subsequent purchaser of Florida II. BCC Florida agreed to accept the assets of the five retail locations in exchange for satisfying the Buyer's remaining obligation of the line of credit from the sale of Florida II, which had a balance of $4,821. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $296 which is included with corporate expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. On July 1, 2016, the Predecessor's indirect subsidiaries, Checksmart Financial Company, Cash Central of Mississippi, LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Alabama, LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Arizona, Inc., and Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc., entered into a swap transaction (the "Transaction") with QC Holdings, Inc., and QC Financial Services, Inc. (collectively "QC"). As part of the Transaction, Predecessor subsidiaries acquired QC Financial Services of California, Inc., which operates sixty retail locations, and thirty-eight retail locations in Ohio, Mississippi, Arizona and Alabama from QC. These new stores were accounted for as an acquisition. Also as part of the Transaction, the Predecessor transferred to QC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Illinois LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Kansas LLC, Buckeye Title Loans of Kansas LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Missouri LLC, Buckeye Title Loans of Missouri LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Utah, Inc., and Buckeye Title Loans of Utah LLC, and the thirty-three retail locations operated by these entities. Other than the transfer of the equity interests and assets, the transaction did not provide for the payment or receipt of any other consideration by the Predecessor subsidiaries or by QC, other than customary post-closing adjustments. In entering into the transaction, the Predecessor and QC each concluded that the fair value of the equity interests and other assets received by QC are substantially equal to the net value of the equity interests and other assets received by the Predecessor.

Note 15. Stock-Based Compensation On May 1, 2006, the Predecessor adopted the 2006 Management Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which the Predecessor's Board of Directors, or a duly-authorized committee thereof, may grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights to employees and consultants of the Predecessor or its subsidiaries. The Predecessor amended the plan to increase the number of shares and to convert the number of shares in the 2006 plan to the 2011 plan. Options that have been granted under the Plan have been granted at an exercise price equal to (or greater than) the stock's fair market value at the date of the grant, with terms of 10 years and vesting generally over four to five years or on the occurrence of a liquidity event. On April 19, 2011, CCFI adopted the "Plan" to be effective as of April 29, 2011. The maximum number of shares that may be subject to awards under the Plan is 2,941,746 as of December 12, 2018. The Company recognizes compensation costs in the financial statements for all share-based payments granted based on the grant date estimated fair value. The Plan allows for awards based on time, performance and market conditions. Compensation expense for awards based on time is expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period. Compensation expense for performance awards are recognized using the accelerated vesting method. Compensation expense for market conditions such as those conditioned on either a liquidity event condition or a specified performance condition have not been recognized and will be recognized upon consummation of the relevant market condition. At December 12, 2018, there were a total of 1,492,167 additional shares available for grant under the Plan. The fair value of an option award is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model. Because lattice-based option valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs, those ranges are disclosed. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the stock of comparable public companies. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of F-44 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 15. Stock-Based Compensation (Continued) options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. In May of 2016, the Predecessor cancelled 1,270,106 options and re-issued 1,243,299 options with a per share exercise price of $2.25 with 1,233,499 options vesting immediately and 9,800 options vesting on specific dates defined in the award agreements. In December of 2016, the Predecessor issued 20,000 options with a per share exercise price of $2.25 with 6,000 options vesting immediately and the remainder vesting on specific dates defined in the award agreement. In January and February of 2017, the Predecessor issued 80,833 options with a per share exercise price of $2.25 with 3,833 options vesting immediately and the remainder vesting on specific dates defined in the award agreements. In April of 2017, a retired Board member settled 8,484 restricted stock units as shares of common stock. In January 2018, the Predecessor issued 76,559 options with a per share exercise price of $1.00 with the options vesting on specific dates defined in the award agreements. The following weighted average assumptions were used by the Predecessor for awards granted during the total years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016: 2018 2017 2016 Risk-free interest rate 1.76 % 1.93 % 1.30 % Dividend yield 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % Expected volatility 150.00 % 55.00 % 65.00 % Expected term (years) 1.00 5.00 5.00 Weighted average fair value of options granted $  $ 2.25 $ 1.23 The Predecessor recorded stock-based compensation costs in the amount of $32, $51, and $1,293, respectively, for the Predecessor period ended December 12, 2018, and the Predecessor years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016. There was no stock based compensation expense recorded for the Successor period as a result of the Restructuring on December 12, 2018. As of December 12, 2018 and December 31, 2017, and 2016, unrecognized stock-based compensation costs to be recognized over future periods approximated $32, $66, and $42, respectively. At December 12, 2018, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense is $66 for certain awards that vest either over the requisite service period or a change in control.

Note 16. Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company files consolidated or separate state income tax returns as permitted by the individual states in which it operates. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 is below the statutory rate due to the continued valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 exceeds the statutory rate due to the impairment of goodwill in each respective year, the valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets, and the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate. The Company had no liability recorded for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2018 and 2017. F-46 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 16. Income Taxes (Continued) The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("the Act") was enacted on December 22, 2017. The income tax effects of changes in tax laws are recognized in the period when enacted. The Act provides for numerous significant tax law changes and modifications with varying effective dates, which includes reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In response to the enactment of the Act in late 2017, the SEC issued SAB 118 to address situations where the accounting is incomplete for certain income tax effects of the Act upon issuance of an entity's financial statements for the reporting period in which the Act was enacted. The measurement period allowed by SAB 118 has closed during the fourth quarter of 2018 in which the Company did not record any adjustments to the net benefit of $3.2 million recorded in 2017 for the re-measurement of its deferred tax balances. The prospects of supplemental legislation or regulatory processes to address uncertainties that arise due to the Act, or evolving technical interpretation of the tax law, may cause the Company's financial statements to be impacted in the future. The Company will continue to analyze the effects of the Act as subsequent guidance continues to emerge. Net deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following as of December 31, 2018: Deferred Tax Assets Deferred Tax Liabilities Noncurrent Noncurrent Allowance for credit losses $ 6,698 $  Goodwill 16,967  Accrued expenses 131  Depreciable assets  5,643 Deferred revenue 2,234  Deferred rent 171  Bond registration expenses 11  Net operating loss 30,834  Capital loss carryover 1,418  Valuation allowance (52,821 )  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 5,643 $ 5,643 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ F-47 Table of Contents CCF Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 16.

At December 31, 2017, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $71,896 and a net deferred tax liability of $-0-. A valuation allowance of $55,194 and $71,896 was recognized at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that was more likely than not expected to be realized. In evaluating whether a valuation allowance was needed for the deferred tax assets, the Company considered the ability to carry net operating losses back to prior periods, reversing taxable temporary differences, and estimates of future taxable income. There have been no credits or net operating losses that have expired. The projections were evaluated in light of past operating results and considered the risks associated with future taxable income related to macroeconomic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates, regulatory developments and cost containment. The Company will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in future periods and will adjust the allowance as necessary if it determines that it is not more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets are expected to be realized. As of December 31, 2018, and 2017, the Company and the Predecessor had approximately $112,151 and $90,501, respectively, of Federal NOLs available to offset future taxable income. Of the available carryover, $105,046 expires from 2036 through 2037; the remaining NOL of $7,105 can be carried forward indefinitely. In accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue code, the usage of the Predecessor's NOLs could be limited in the event of a change in ownership. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period when those temporary differences become deductible. If a change of ownership did occur there would be an annual limitation on the usage of the Company's losses which are available through 2037.

Transactions with Variable Interest Entities The Company has limited agency agreements with unaffiliated third-party lenders. The agreements govern the terms by which the Company refers customers to that lender, on a non-exclusive basis, for a possible extension of credit, processes loan applications and commits to reimburse the lender for any loans or related fees that were not collected from such customers. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the outstanding amount of active consumer loans with unaffiliated third-party lenders guaranteed by the Company and the Predecessor, which represented the Company's maximum exposure, was $34,144 and $36,967, respectively. The outstanding amount of consumer loans with unaffiliated third-party lenders consist of $33,841 and $35,801 in short-term and $303 and $1,166 in installment loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The accrual for third party lender losses related to these obligations totaled $4,513 and $4,818 as of December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. This obligation is recorded as a current liability on the Company and the Predecessor's consolidated balance sheet. The Company has determined that the lenders are VIEs but that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. Therefore, the Company has not consolidated either lender.

The Class C Common Units were issued to equity holders of the Predecessor. All of these issuances were made pursuant to the exemption from registration provided under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

Undertakings (a) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that: (1) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. (2) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this Offering Registration Statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this Offering Registration Statement as of the time it was declared effective. (3) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
