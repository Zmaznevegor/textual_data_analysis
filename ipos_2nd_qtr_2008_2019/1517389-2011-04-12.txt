PROSPECTUS LIBERTY VISION, INC. SHARES OF COMMON STOCK 1,000,000 Minimum - 10,000,000 Maximum Before this Offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. In the event that we sell at least the minimum number of shares in this Offering, of which there is no assurance, we intend to have our shares of common stock quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. There is no assurance that our shares will ever be quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. We are offering a minimum of 1,000,000 and a maximum of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock in a direct public offering, without any involvement of underwriters or broker-dealers. The offering price is $0.05 per share. In the event that 1,000,000 shares are not sold within 180 days of the effective date of our Prospectus, or within an additional 90 days if we choose so, all money received by us will be promptly, returned to you with interest and without deduction of any kind. The extension of an additional 90 days would result in an offering period of up to 270 days total. Funds will be held in a separate account. The foregoing account is not an escrow, trust, or similar account. It is merely a separate interest bearing savings account under our control where we have segregated your funds. Only our officers and Directors will have access to the account. You will not have the right to withdraw your funds during the offering. You will only receive your funds back if we do not raise the minimum amount of the offering within 180 days or, if extended, 270 days. As a result, if we are sued for any reason and a judgment is rendered against us, your subscription could be seized in a garnishment proceeding. If we file a voluntary bankruptcy petition or our creditors file an involuntary bankruptcy petition, our assets will be seized by the bankruptcy trustee, including your subscription, and used to pay our creditors. If that happens, you will lose your investment, even if we fail to raise the minimum amount in this offering. As a result, you may lose your entire investment notwithstanding the purported minimum offering provisions because the funds are not held in an escrow account and are potentially subject to creditor claims. Our common stock will be sold on our behalf by Oleg Gabidulin, Vadim Erofeev, Marina Sherbatenko and Ilia Burakov, our Directors. Our Directors will not receive any commissions or proceeds from the offering for selling shares on our behalf. If we raise only the minimum amount of proceeds from this offering we will have limited funds available to build and grow our business. There is no assurance that we will achieve any of additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing for to fund our planned business activities. We may also rely on loans from our Directors; however, there are no assurances that our Directors will provide us with any additional funds. Currently, we do not have any arrangements for additional financing. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. Investing in our common stock involves risks. See "Risk Factors" starting on page 8.

Our Company We were formed on September 29, 2009. Liberty Vision, Inc. is a provider of services that enable individuals and small businesses to establish, maintain and evolve an online presence. We offer a full range of web services, including custom web design, website usability consulting, website maintenance, web analytics implementation, web marketing services, social and viral marketing campaigns and search engine optimization consulting. We target the individual and small business markets by seeking to provide a one-stop shop for establishing and maintaining an online presence. Our services can be purchased independently or as bundled offerings targeted to meet the specific needs of our customers. Simplifying the Internet for Small Businesses. Our goal is to enable small businesses to outsource their web services needs to us. We guide the customer through the necessary steps to establish their online presence, generate traffic to their websites and increase direct consumer interaction. We provide consulting on a wide variety of issues, from selection of domain name registrars and hosting providers, to the most cost-efficient marketing strategies. We generate revenue from sales of web services made directly to small and medium business customers. We acquire customers through referrals and our primary website, www.LibertyVisionOnline.com , which outlines our service offerings and showcases our portfolio of work. 5 On January 27, 2011 we have incorporated a wholly owned (ownership interest  100%) subsidiary Liberty Vision Media, Inc. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. We have commenced our operations during the year ended February 28, 2010. As of February 28, 2011 we have generated $128.336 in revenues and have incurred $104,717 in operating costs since our inception on September 29, 2009. To date we have relied upon revenues from our operations and sale of our securities in unregistered private placement transactions to fund our operations. We are a development stage company with a limited operating history. Accordingly, for the foreseeable future, we will continue to be dependent on revenues from operations and additional financing in order to maintain our operations and continue with our corporate activities. This offering and any investment in our common stock involve a high degree of risk. If our future revenues will not be sufficient to cover our operating costs we may be obliged to cease business operations due to lack of funds. If we raise only the minimum amount of proceeds from this offering we will have limited funds available to build and grow our business. There is no assurance that we will achieve any of additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing for to fund our planned business activities. We may also rely on loans from our Directors; however, there are no assurances that our Directors will provide us with any additional funds. Currently, we do not have any arrangements for additional financing. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. We face many challenges to continue operations, including our limited operating history, competition, general economic conditions, etc. Please review the "Risk Factors" starting on page 8 of this offering. Our Directors collectively own 100% of the 3,980,000 outstanding shares of our common stock as of the date of this Offering. If the minimum amount of the shares will be sold, our Directors will own 79.92% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, they will have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. The interests of our directors may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders. Our principal executive offices are located at 2530 Meridian Parkway, Suite 200, Durham, NC and our telephone number is (919) 806-4593. Our primary website address is www.LibertyVisionOnline.com . The information on, or that can be accessed through this website is not part of this prospectus.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this prospectus before making an investment decision. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We face intense competition in our industry. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business will be seriously harmed. The market for our web development and marketing services is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. Our competitors vary in size and in the variety of services they offer. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and an established client base. These competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging web design technologies and changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sales of their services than we can. If we fail to compete successfully against our competitors, our revenue could decline and our business could be harmed. The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management. Following the completion of this offering, we will be required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements, including those required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Complying with these reporting and other regulatory requirements will be time-consuming and will result in increased costs to us and could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As a public company, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or SOX. These requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The SOX requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. These activities may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some 8 activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. We also expect that being a public company and these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers. Our business relies on our ability to attract new customers. If we are unable to attract new customers, our business will fail. Our future growth is dependent on our ability to attract new customers and our ability to sell additional services to our existing customers. We rely on online marketing and referrals from existing customers and other business associates to attract new customers. We also rely on selling additional services to our new or existing clients, such as search engine optimization and web marketing services, for additional revenue. If we are unable to attract new customers or sell additional services to our existing customers, our revenue will likely decline and our business will fail. Our operating results could be impaired if we become subject to burdensome government regulation and legal uncertainties. We are not currently subject to direct regulation by any domestic or foreign governmental agency, other than regulations applicable to businesses generally. However, due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet, relating to user privacy, content and copyrights. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the expansion of the Internet. A decline in the growth of the Internet could decrease demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed by any new legislation or regulation. The funds raised in this offering and held by us during pendency of the offering may be subject to creditor’s claims. We are offering 1,000,000 shares of common stock minimum, 10,000,000 shares of common stock maximum in a direct public offering, without any involvement of underwriters or broker/dealers. In the event that 1,000,000 shares are not sold within 180 days of the effective date of our Prospectus, or within an additional 90 days if we choose so, all money received by us will be promptly returned to you with interest and without deduction of any kind. We will return your funds to you in the form of a cashier’s check sent by Federal Express on the 181 st day or, if extended, on the 271 st day. If at least 1,000,000 shares are sold within 180 days of the effective date of our 9 Prospectus or, if extended, within the additional 90 days, all money received by us will be retained by us and there will be no refund. Funds will be held in a separate bank account. Sold securities are deemed securities which have been paid for with collected funds prior to expiration of 180 days or, if extended, 270 days. Collected funds are deemed funds that have been paid by the drawee bank. The foregoing account is not an escrow, trust or similar account. It is merely a separate interest bearing savings account under our control where we have segregated your funds. There is no escrow, trust or similar account in which your subscription will be deposited. Only our officers and directors will have access to the account. You will not have the right to withdraw your funds during the offering. You will only receive your funds back if we do not raise the minimum amount of the offering within 180 days or, if extended, 270 days. As a result, if we are sued for any reason and a judgment is rendered against us, your subscription could be seized in a garnishment proceeding. If we file a voluntary bankruptcy petition or our creditors file an involuntary bankruptcy petition, our assets will be seized by the bankruptcy trustee, including your subscription, and used to pay our creditors. If that happens, you will lose your investment, even if we fail to raise the minimum amount in this offering. As a result, you may lose your entire investment notwithstanding the purported minimum offering provisions because the funds are not held in an escrow account and are potentially subject to creditor claims. We lack an operating history. There is no assurance our future operations will result in profitable revenues. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably, our business will fail. We were incorporated on September 29, 2009, have realized $128,336 in revenues and incurred $104,717 in operating costs since inception. As of February 28, 2011, we had $23,619 in retained earnings. We have a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Based upon current plans, we expect to continue generating revenues. However our revenues may not be sufficient to cover our operating costs. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating significant revenues in the future. Failure to achieve a sustainable sales level will cause us to go out of business. We depend on key personnel. Our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key personnel, particularly, Oleg Gabidulin, our President and Director, Marina Sherbatenko, our Secretary and Treasurer, Vadim Erofeev, our Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer and Director, and Ilia Burakov, our Director. We have entered into consulting agreements with Oleg Gabidulin, our President, and Vadim Erofeev, our Chief Financial Officer, on September 30, 2010. Either party can terminate these contracts with a sixty (60) day advance written notice. We have not entered into consulting or employment agreements with Mrs. Sherbatenko and Mr. Burakov. If any of our directors and officers will choose to leave the company, we will face significant difficulties in attracting potential candidates for replacement of our key personnel due to our limited financial resources and operating history. In addition, the loss of any key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel could delay our plan of operations and harm our ability to provide services to our current customers and harm the market’s perception of us. Our officers, directors, consultants and advisors are not obligated to commit their time and attention exclusively to our business and therefore they may encounter conflicts of interest with respect to the allocation of time and business opportunities between our operations and those of other businesses. Our directors are not obligated to commit their time and attention exclusively to our business and, accordingly, they may encounter conflicts of interest in allocating their own time, or any business opportunities which they may encounter, between our operations and those of other businesses. 10 Currently, Oleg Gabidulin, our President, and Director, Vadim Erofeev our Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer and Director, Marina Sherbatenko our Secretary and Treasurer and Ilia Burakov, our Director each commit between 30% and 50% of their time to our business in their capacities as officers and directors. Nevertheless, if the execution of our business plan demands more time than is currently committed by any of our officers, directors, consultants or advisors, they will be under no obligation to commit such additional time, and their failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to carry on our business and successfully execute our business plan. Additionally, all of our officers and directors, in the course of their other business activities, may become aware of investment, business or information which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as to other entities to which they owe a fiduciary duty. They may also in the future become affiliated with entities that are engaged in business or other activities similar to those we intend to conduct. As a result, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity particular opportunities or information should be presented. If, as a result of such conflict, we are deprived of investment, business or information, the execution of our business plan and our ability to effectively compete in the marketplace may be adversely affected. Because our management has limited experience running a website development and online marketing company, our business has a higher risk of failure. Our Directors have limited experience running a business that provides website development and online marketing services. As a result, we may not be able to recognize and take advantage of opportunities without the aid of qualified marketing, sales, and business development consultants. Our Directors’ decisions and choices may not be well thought out and our operations, earnings, and ultimate financial success may suffer irreparable harm as a result. We do not intend to pay dividends and there will be less ways in which you can make a gain on any investment in Liberty Vision, Inc. We have never paid any cash dividends and currently do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. To the extent that we require additional funding currently not provided for in our financing plan, our funding sources may likely prohibit the payment of a dividend. Because we do not intend to declare dividends, any gain on an investment in Liberty Vision, Inc. will need to come through appreciation of the stock’s price. Because our Directors, who are also our sole promoters, will own 79.92% of our outstanding common stock, if the minimum amount of the offering will be sold, they could make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to other minority shareholders. Our Directors own 100% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the date of this Offering. If the minimum amount of the shares will be sold, our Directors will own 79.92% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, they will have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. They will also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of our directors may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders. There is no public (trading) market for our common stock and there is no assurance that the common stock will ever trade on a recognized exchange or dealers’ network; therefore, our investors may not be able to sell their shares. Our common stock is not listed on any exchange or quoted on any similar quotation service, and there is currently no public market for our common stock. We have not taken any steps to enable our common stock to be quoted 11 on the OTC Bulletin Board, and can provide no assurance that our common stock will ever be quoted on any quotation service or that any market for our common stock will ever develop. As a result, stockholders may be unable to liquidate their investments, or may encounter considerable delay in selling shares of our common stock. Neither we nor our selling stockholders have engaged an underwriter for this Offering, and we cannot assure you that any brokerage firm will act as a market maker of our securities. A trading market may not develop in the future, and if one does develop, it may not be sustained. If an active trading market does develop, the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile due to, among other things, the nature of our business and because we are a new public company with a limited operating history. Further, even if a public market develops, the volume of trading in our common stock will presumably be limited and likely be dominated by a few individual stockholders. The limited volume, if any, will make the price of our common stock subject to manipulation by one or more stockholders and will significantly limit the number of shares that one can purchase or sell in a short period of time. The market price of our common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, most of which are beyond our control: - variations in our quarterly operating results; - changes in general economic conditions; - loss of a major customer, partner or joint venture participant; and - the addition or loss of key managerial and collaborative personnel. The equity markets have, on occasion, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies' securities and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Any such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. As a result, stockholders may be unable to sell their shares, or may be forced to sell them at a loss. You could be diluted from our future issuance of capital stock and derivative securities. As of February 28, 2011, we had 3,980,000 shares of common stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. We are authorized to issue up to 75,000,000 shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock. To the extent of such authorization, our Board of Directors will have the ability, without seeking stockholder approval, to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock in the future for such consideration as the Board of Directors may consider sufficient. The issuance of additional common stock or preferred stock in the future may reduce your proportionate ownership and voting power. If our common stock is accepted for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board, the application of the “Penny Stock” rules could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and increase your transaction costs to sell those shares. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 3A51-1, which establishes the definition of a “Penny Stock,” for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has market price of less than $5.00 per share or within an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, Rule 15G-9 require: - that a broker or dealer approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks; and - the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: - obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and - make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. 12 The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: - sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and - that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the "penny stock” rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock. You may face significant restrictions on the resale of your shares due to state “blue sky” laws. Each state has its own securities laws, often called “blue sky” laws, which (1) limit sales of securities to a state’s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (2) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or it must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker-dealer must also be registered in that state. We do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. A determination regarding registration will be made by those broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as market makers for our common stock. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our securities. You should therefore consider the resale market for our common stock to be limited, as you may be unable to resell your shares without the significant expense of state registration or qualification.

USE OF PROCEEDS Our Offering is being made on a self underwritten basis - with a minimum of $50,000 in gross proceeds. The table below sets forth the use of proceeds if $50,000 (i.e. gross proceeds of the minimum offering) or $500,000 (i.e. gross proceeds of the maximum offering) of our common stock is sold. Our Offering is being conducted on a best-efforts minimum 1,000,000/ maximum 10,000,000 basis. The offering scenarios presented below are for illustrative purposes only and the actual amount of proceeds, if any, may differ. Minimum Offering Proceeds (Gross: $50,000) Maximum Offering Proceeds ( Gross: $500,000) Gross proceeds $ 50,000 $ 500,000 Offering expenses 9,308 9,308 Net proceeds $ 40,692 $ 490,692 The net proceeds will be used as follows: Minimum Offering Proceeds (Net: $40,692) Maximum Offering Proceeds ( Net: $490,692) Liabilities $ 7,481 $ 7,481 Website Optimization Package Development 2,500 2,500 Ad Serving and Management Solution Development 30,000 30,000 Web Developer (Full time), Graphic Designer (Part-time) - 120,000 Development of Web Publishing Suite of Services - 300,000 General and administrative 711 30,711 TOTAL $ 40,692 $ 490,692 Total offering expenses are approximately $9,308. Of the $9,308, the amounts to be paid from the proceeds for expenses of the offering are: $3,250 for accounting fees; $800 for filing fees; $4,200 for legal fees; $58 for registration fee; and $1,000 for transfer agent fees. We will use the rest of the funds (net of offering expenses) 14 for paying off our current liabilities, hiring new personnel and implementation of our business plan. In the future, in addition to equity financing, we may rely on loans from our Directors and officers to continue our operations; however, there are no assurances that our Directors will provide us with any additional funds. Currently, we do not have any arrangements for additional financing. If we are not able to obtain needed financing and generate sufficient revenue from operations, we may have to cease operations. DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The offering price of $0.05 of our common stock has been arbitrarily determined in order for us to raise up to a total of $500,000 in this Offering and bears no relationship to any objective criterion of value. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, historical earnings or net worth. In determining the offering price, management considered such factors as the prospects, if any, for similar companies, anticipated results of operations, present financial resources and the likelihood of acceptance of this offering. In addition we took into consideration the most recent shares for debt settlement with our directors and officers at a deemed price of $0.05 per share. No valuation or appraisal has been prepared for our business. We cannot assure you that a public market for our securities will develop or continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price higher than the offering price. DILUTION OF THE PRICE PER SHARE Dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this Offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. As of February 28, 2011, the net tangible book value of our shares of common stock was $90,319 or approximately $0.023 per share based upon 3,980,000 shares outstanding. If the maximum number of shares is sold: Upon completion of this Offering, in the event all of the shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 13,980,000 shares to be outstanding will be $581,011, or approximately $0.042 per share. The amount of dilution to the shareholders acquiring shares in this offering will be $0.008 per share. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing shareholder will be increased by $0.019 per share without any additional investment on their part. The shareholders acquiring shares in this Offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.05 per share to $0.042 per share. After completion of this Offering, if 10,000,000 shares are sold, the shareholders acquiring shares in this Offering will own approximately 71.53% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which the shareholders acquiring shares will have made cash investment of $500,000, or $0.05 per share. Our existing shareholders will own approximately 28.47% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which they have made contributions of cash of $2,700, or $0.001 per share and provided consulting services valued at $64,000. If the minimum number of shares is sold: Upon completion of this Offering, in the event 1,000,000 shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 4,980,000 shares to be outstanding will be $131,011 or approximately $ 0.026 per share. The amount of dilution 15 to the shareholders acquiring shares in this offering will be $ 0.024 per share. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be increased by $0.003 per share without any additional investment on their part. The shareholders acquiring shares in this offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.05 per share to $ 0.026 per share. After completion of this Offering, if 1,000,000 shares are sold, the shareholders acquiring shares in this Offering will own approximately 20.08% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which the shareholders acquiring shares have made cash investment of $50,000, or $0.05 per share. Our existing shareholders will own approximately 79.92% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which they have made contributions of cash, totaling $2,700, or $0.001 per share and provided consulting services valued at $64,000. The following table compares the differences of investment in our shares to the shareholders acquiring shares in this Offering with investment in our shares of our existing stockholders. Existing stockholders if all of the shares are sold: Price per share $ 0.001 Net tangible book value per share before offering $ 0.023 Net tangible book value per share after offering $ 0.042 Increase to present stockholders in net tangible book value per share after offering $ 0.019 Capital contributions (cash) $ 2,700 Number of shares outstanding before the offering 3,980,000 Number of shares after offering held by existing stockholders 3,980,000 Percentage of ownership after offering 28.47% Purchasers of shares in this Offering if all shares sold: Price per share $ 0.05 Dilution per share $ 0.008 Capital contributions $ 500,000 Number of shares after offering held by public investors 10,000,000 Percentage of ownership after offering 71.53% Existing stockholders if the minimum number of shares sold: Price per share $ 0.001 Net tangible book value per share before offering $ 0.023 Net tangible book value per share after offering $ 0.026 Increase to present stockholders in net tangible book value per share after offering $ 0.003 Capital contributions (cash) $ 2,700 Number of shares outstanding before the offering 3,980,000 Number of shares after offering held by existing stockholders 3,980,000 Percentage of ownership after offering 79.92% 16 Purchasers of shares in this Offering if the minimum number of shares sold: Price per share $ 0.05 Dilution per share $ 0.024 Capital contributions $ 50,000 Number of shares after offering held by public investors 1,000,000 Percentage of ownership after offering 20.08% PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION; TERMS OF THE OFFERING We are offering 1,000,000 shares of common stock minimum, 10,000,000 shares of common stock maximum in a direct public offering, without any involvement of underwriters or broker/dealers. The offering price is $0.05 per share. In the event that 1,000,000 shares are not sold within 180 days of the effective date of our Prospectus, or within an additional 90 days if we choose so, all money received by us will be promptly returned to you with interest and without deduction of any kind. We will return your funds to you in the form of a cashier’s check sent by Federal Express on the 181 st day or, if extended, on the 271 st day. If at least 1,000,000 shares are sold within 180 days of the effective date of our Prospectus or, if extended, within the additional 90 days, all money received by us will be retained by us and there will be no refund. Funds will be held in a separate bank account. Sold securities are deemed securities which have been paid for with collected funds prior to expiration of 180 days or, if extended, 270 days. Collected funds are deemed funds that have been paid by the drawee bank. The foregoing account is not an escrow, trust or similar account. It is merely a separate interest bearing savings account under our control where we have segregated your funds. There is no escrow, trust or similar account in which your subscription will be deposited. Only our officers and directors will have access to the account. You will not have the right to withdraw your funds during the offering. You will only receive your funds back if we do not raise the minimum amount of the offering within 180 days or, if extended, 270 days. As a result, if we are sued for any reason and a judgment is rendered against us, your subscription could be seized in a garnishment proceeding. If we file a voluntary bankruptcy petition or our creditors file an involuntary bankruptcy petition, our assets will be seized by the bankruptcy trustee, including your subscription, and used to pay our creditors. If that happens, you will lose your investment, even if we fail to raise the minimum amount in this offering. As a result, you may lose your entire investment notwithstanding the purported minimum offering provisions because the funds are not held in an escrow account and are potentially subject to creditor claims. There are no finders involved in our distribution. Officers, directors, affiliates or anyone involved in marketing our shares will not be allowed to purchase shares in the Offering. You will not have the right to withdraw your funds during the Offering. You will only have the right to have your funds returned if we do not raise the minimum amount of the Offering or if there is a material change in the terms of the Offering. The following are material changes that would entitle you to a refund of your money: - a change in the offering price; - a change in the minimum sales requirement; - a change in the amount of proceeds necessary to release the funds held in the separate bank account; - a change to allow sales to affiliates in order to meet the minimum sales requirement; and - an extension of the offering period beyond 270 days. We will sell the shares in this Offering through our Directors, Oleg Gabidulin, Vadim Erofeev, Marina Sherbatenko and Ilia Burakov. They will receive no commission from the sale of any shares. They will not register as a broker-dealer under Section 15 of the Exchange Act in reliance upon Rule 3a4-1. 17 Rule 3a4-1 sets forth those conditions under which a person associated with an issuer may participate in the offering of the issuer's securities and not be deemed to be a broker-dealer. The conditions are that: 1. The person is not statutorily disqualified, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Act, at the time of his participation; and, 2. The person is not compensated in connection with her participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities; 3. The person is not at the time of their participation, an associated person of a broker-dealer; and, 4. The person meets the conditions of Paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Rule 3a4-1 of the Securities Exchange Act 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), in that she (A) primarily performs, or is intended primarily to perform at the end of the offering, substantial duties for or on behalf of the issuer otherwise than in connection with transactions in securities; and (B) is not a broker or dealer, or an associated person of a broker or dealer, within the preceding 12 months; and (C) does not participate in selling and offering of securities for any issuer more than once every 12 months other than in reliance on Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(iii). Our Directors and officers are not statutorily disqualified, are not being compensated, and are not associated with a broker-dealer. They are and will continue to be our officers and Directors at the end of the Offering and have not been during the last 12 months and are currently not broker-dealers or associated with a broker-dealer. They have not during the last twelve months and will not in the next 12 months offer or sell securities for another corporation. Only after our Prospectus is declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), we intend to distribute this Prospectus to potential investors at meetings and to our friends, business associates and relatives who are interested in us and a possible investment in the Offering. We will not utilize the Internet to advertise our Offering. Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act Our shares are covered by Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 15g-1 through 15g-6 promulgated thereunder. They impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $160,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouses). Rule 15g-1 exempts a number of specific transactions from the scope of the penny stock rules. Rule 15g-2 declares unlawful broker-dealer transactions in penny stocks unless the broker-dealer has first provided to the customer a standardized disclosure document. Rule 15g-3 provides that it is unlawful for a broker-dealer to engage in a penny stock transaction unless the broker-dealer first discloses and subsequently confirms to the customer current quotation prices or similar market information concerning the penny stock in question. Rule 15g-4 prohibits broker-dealers from completing penny stock transactions for a customer unless the broker-dealer first discloses to the customer the amount of compensation or other remuneration received as a result of the penny stock transaction. 18 Rule 15g-5 requires that a broker-dealer executing a penny stock transaction, other than one exempt under Rule 15g-1, disclose to its customer, at the time of or prior to the transaction, information about the sales persons compensation. Rule 15g-6 requires broker-dealers selling penny stocks to provide their customers with monthly account statements. Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers to approved the transaction for the customer's account; obtain a written agreement from the customer setting forth the identity and quantity of the stock being purchased; obtain from the customer information regarding his investment experience; make a determination that the investment is suitable for the investor; deliver to the customer a written statement for the basis for the suitability determination; notify the customer of his rights and remedies in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions; and, the NASDs toll free telephone number and the central number of the North American Administrators Association, for information on the disciplinary history of broker-dealers and their associated persons. The application of the penny stock rules may affect your ability to resell your shares. Offering Period and Expiration Date This Offering will start on the date of this Prospectus and continue for a period of up to 180 days, and an additional 90 days, if so elected by our Board of Directors. The extension of an additional 90 days would result in an offering period of up to 270 days total. Procedures for Subscribing If you decide to subscribe for any shares in this Offering, you must: (i) execute and deliver a subscription agreement; and (ii) deliver a check, money order or certified funds to us for acceptance or rejection. All checks, money orders or certified funds for subscriptions must be made payable to Liberty Vision, Inc. Right to Reject Subscriptions We have the right to accept or reject subscriptions in whole or in part, for any reason or for no reason. All monies from rejected subscriptions will be returned immediately by us to the subscriber, without interest or deductions. Subscriptions for securities will be accepted or rejected within 48 hours after we receive them. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION We are a development stage corporation with limited operations and limited revenues from our business operations. To meet our needs for cash required for the implementation of our business plan we are attempting to raise money from this offering. If we raise the minimum amount through this offering, we will be able to achieve short term goals of our business plan and to continue operations and remain in business for the next 12 months. If we are unable to generate revenues for any reason, or if we are unable to make a reasonable profit, we may have to cease operations. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering. If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend implementation of our business plan until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely if revenue from operations will not be sufficient to cover our operating costs. 19 If we raise the maximum amount, we believe we can implement our short term and long-term business plan and achieve profitable operations, however, we cannot guarantee that proceeds from this offering will be sufficient for us to continue as going concern for the next five years. If we raise less than the maximum amount and we need more money, we will have to revert to obtaining additional money through a second public offering, a private placement of securities, or loans. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans. Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital There is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in the development stage of operations and cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns, such as increases in advertizing and marketing costs, increases in administration expenditures associated with daily operations, increases in accounting and audit fees, increases in legal fees related to filings and regulatory compliance. We anticipate relying on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund implementation of our business plan. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any of additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing for to fund our planned business activities. We may also rely on loans from our Directors; however, there are no assurances that our Directors will provide us with any additional funds. Currently, we do not have any arrangements for additional financing. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. Results of Operations From Inception on September 29, 2009 through February 28, 2011. Our results of operations, as reported in our consolidated financial statements, incorporate results of operations of our wholly owned Canadian subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. We were formed on September 29, 2009, and commenced our operations during the year ended February 28, 2010. Liberty Vision, Inc. is a provider of services that enable individuals and small businesses to establish, maintain and evolve an online presence. During the period from September 29, 2009 (inception), through February 28, 2011, we have generated $128,336 in revenues from sales and incurred $104,717 in operating costs since inception. We generate revenue from sales of our services such as website development, web marketing, social media marketing and search engine optimization consulting. Our cost of revenues consisted of salaries and wages, professional fees, office rent, officers’ compensation expense, and other general and administrative expenses. As of February 28, 2011, we incurred $104,717 in operating costs including $44,000 for consulting fees; $20,000 for management fees, $20,175 for salaries and wages, $6,493 for rent, $855 for organization costs and $13,194 for other general and administrative costs. 20 We have hired consultants in the areas of bookkeeping and accounting. We have retained an attorney in relation to this Registration Statement, and an auditor to audit our financial statements. As of the date of this prospectus we have two full-time employees. We plan to hire additional personnel, subject to financing and our cash flow from operations, within twelve months from the effective date of our registration statement. Since inception, we have sold 2,700,000 shares of common stock at $0.001 per share to our Directors for total proceeds of $2,700 and issued 1,280,000 restricted shares of common stock in the capital of the Company at a deemed price of $0.05 per share to settle the amounts owed to the Company’s President and Chief Financial Officer for consulting and management services. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of February 28, 2011, our total assets of $100,843 consisted of cash of $84,665, accounts receivable of $12,660 and computer equipment of $3,518 and our total liabilities were $10,524 for a total working capital of $86,801. During the period from September 29, 2009 (inception) through February 28, 2011, we have financed our operations through the issuance of 2,700,000 shares of common stock at $0.001 per share to our Directors for total proceeds of $2,700, issuance of 1,280,000 shares of common stock at a deemed price of $0.05 per share for consulting and management services and revenues of $128,336. As of February 28, 2011, we had cash of $84,665 and accounts receivable of $12,660. We believe that we need approximately an additional $50,000 (gross) to implement our short-term business plan and meet our working capital requirements over the next 12 months. Our intention is to obtain this money through this offering. We intend to use the proceeds from this offering to finance our ongoing operations and implementation of our short-term (12 months) business plan (see Plan of Operations, page 26). As of the date of this Registration Statement we do not have any other arrangements of sources of financing beside anticipated proceeds from this offering and proceeds from future sales. We anticipate future capital requirements for financing of our ongoing operations to be approximately $100,000 per year. In addition we will require approximately $330,000 over the five-year period for development and introduction of the new products. To date, our cash flow requirements have been primarily met by cash generated from revenues and equity financings. Management expects to keep operating costs to a minimum until cash is available through financing or operating activities. Management plans to continue to seek, in addition to equity financing, other sources of financing (e.g. bank loan, line of credit, shareholder loan) on favorable terms; however, there are no assurances that any such financing can be obtained on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to generate profits sufficient to cover our operating costs or unable to obtain additional funds for our working capital needs, we may need to cease or curtail operations. Furthermore, there is no assurance the net proceeds from any successful financing arrangement will be sufficient to cover cash requirements during the initial stages of the Company’s operations.

Web Design and Online Marketing Industry Web Design The internet has become the primary source for information for many people as well as a way to purchase goods and services, socialize and access the most up to date news. While most large corporations already use the internet to market and sell to customers around the world, many small and new businesses have not capitalized on the global reach and ease of communication a website provides. In todays world it is essential for companies who want to attract new consumers to have a website that is professional and informative. Many new businesses and small businesses that do not yet have an online presence are using web developers to help design and launch their websites. With a large number of web development companies, both large and small, and the demand for professionally designed websites, the web development industry is highly competitive. There are many reasons for a business to invest in developing a website. Some advantages of having a website include: · Businesses with a website are open to customers for business 24 hours a day and potential customers in different time zones do not have to conform to regular office hours in order to purchase products or find more information about a business. Online forms can be used to allow potential customers to request quotes or other information, without the cost of a long distance call. · A website is also much easier and cost effective to update than any printed material, which allows companies to provide consumers with more comprehensive and up to date information. · Another advantage of having an online presence is the ability to sell your products through an online store. This allows a potential customer to browse through a companys products and purchase them from the comfort of their homes. It also allows customers to purchase products that are not available in their local stores. · A website can also be used as an effective recruiting tool. Many businesses are posting job opportunities on their websites as well as descriptions about the companys benefits and culture. Online Marketing Online marketing is relatively inexpensive when compared to traditional advertising. Companies can reach a wide audience for a small fraction of a traditional advertising budget. Many consumers now use the internet as one of the primary sources to gather information about companies and purchase goods and services. Online marketing allows companies to target those consumers and bring them directly to their website with a fairly low marketing budget. 22 A big advantage of online marketing is the ability to measure statistics easily and relatively inexpensively. Nearly all aspects of an Internet marketing campaign can be tracked, measured, and tested. Companies who use online marketing can use a variety of methods to track the results of their campaigns through the use of such tracking devices as web analytics. Therefore, marketers can determine which messages or offerings are more appealing to the audience. The results of campaigns can be measured and tracked immediately because online marketing initiatives usually require users to click on an advertisement, visit a website, and perform a targeted action. Such measurement cannot be achieved through billboard advertising, where an individual may be interested but has to take additional steps, such as visiting a store or researching online to obtain more information or purchase the product or service being advertised. Due to the effectiveness of online advertising and the relatively low cost, many companies are now using online marketing alongside traditional marketing. For small businesses that do not have a large marketing budget, online marketing is sometimes the only way they can advertise their business to consumers. Online Marketing tools include: - Paid Search Advertising. Paid search advertising refers to search engine advertising such as Google AdWords (Yahoo and MSN have similar paid search programs available). With paid search advertising, companies only pay each time someone clicks from their ad on the search engine (e.g. Google) through to their website. The main benefit of this type of online advertising is an immediate increase in targeted website traffic and potential new clients. - Email Marketing. Email marketing is an integral part of an effective online marketing strategy. While being targeted, measurable and effective, and at half the cost of traditional direct marketing efforts, e-marketing campaigns and newsletters have provided a form of communication that many companies are now adding to their marketing initiatives. - Social Media Marketing. Social Media Marketing is a popular web marketing method. With high traffic sites like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter available to help businesses, smart business owners are investing in this highly profitable niche to not only drive traffic to their sites, but to get people talking about their company and its products. - Blogging. Blogging is another popular online marketing tool that allows companies to write about new developments in their business in an informal and relatable way as well as constantly add new content to their websites and increase their search engine optimization. Competition Competition in the web development and online advertising industry is intense and highly fragmented. Our competition is any company that provides one or more of our company’s core service offerings. Our competition includes Advertising Firms, Public Relations Companies, Web Design Companies, Graphic Design Companies, and Search Engine Optimization Firms. Our competitors range in size from small, local independent firms and individuals to very large conglomerates. Such fragmentation can mean that a small business owner can employ more than one web services provider to get a needed mix of web design and online marketing services for their desired budget. The web services industry is always evolving with thousands of new competitors entering the market every year. It is becoming very difficult for companies to distinguish themselves in the market and gain new customers. In addition to competitors, many businesses are deciding to design their own websites and execute online advertising campaigns themselves, reducing the number of potential customers. There are a large number of 23 companies that provide website templates that a business can purchase and change easily, without the need to hire a web development company. While basic coding knowledge is needed to effectively customize a template to fit an individual businesss needs, many new businesses are choosing to use an existing template versus paying for a new website design. Our Business Description of Business Liberty Vision is a full service web design and online marketing agency. We provide services such as web design and development and online marketing solutions that enable small businesses to build and maintain an effective online presence. To date, we have focused on providing one-off services such as development of a fully functioning website to small business clients. We plan to expand our service offerings to include subscription-based service packages. Our current services include: Website Development and Consulting Website Design Services We design websites to suit small business needs, whether its a fully interactive flash-driven site or a simple informational page. Our custom design service includes the development of a unique website look and layout that is created specifically for our client. Website Usability Consulting Through our website usability consulting services, we help our customers ensure that their website is as intuitive and easy to use as possible for their visitors. Areas we consult on include design and layout, information architecture, ease of navigation, functionality, accessibility, content and search engine optimization requirements. Website Maintenance Keeping a website up to date is crucial to ensure effective communication with the website visitors and clients of the business. It also improves the website's search engine optimization if the content is being updated on a regular basis. Web Analytics Implementation It is essential to know who is coming to a website, where they are coming from, what keywords they are using to find the site, and what they are interested in once they have arrived. Liberty Vision helps with implementation of Google Analytics, a web statistics package that provides all this information. Web Marketing Paid Search Advertising Paid search advertising refers to search engine advertising such as Google AdWords (Yahoo and MSN have similar paid search programs available). Search advertisements are targeted to match key search terms (called keywords) entered on search engines. We help our clients manage their search campaigns by: · Selecting targeted keywords and monitoring their effectiveness. · Creating relevant ad text that is likely to convert leads into new clients. · Structuring and optimizing campaigns for better performance and maximum results. 24 · Providing monthly client reporting to communicate the strategies we’ve implemented and recommendations for future improvement. · Developing and researching possible new avenues of online marketing to build the new client base. Online Marketing Review We provide feedback and recommendations on how to improve areas such as: website design and layout, information architecture, ease of navigation, functionality, accessibility, content and search engine optimization requirements. Landing Page Development There are times when an advertising campaign needs to send users to a specific 'landing page' on a website as opposed to the homepage or another general site page. We assist with landing page development which is a must have for any sort of paid search advertising. Blogging A blog is an efficient way to improve search engine optimization while encouraging repeat visitors and increasing visitor retention. We can implement a customized blog that blends seamlessly into the design of an existing website. Social & Viral Marketing Social and Viral Marketing Campaigns We help companies to create innovative, interactive online campaigns that build brand awareness. Social Media Consulting We provide consulting services on social media outlet management, such as corporate Facebook pages and Twitter account updates. Custom Facebook Page Design We help ensure that the company’s presence on Facebook reflects the look and feel of the company's brand and website. Twitter Maintaining and managing an active and effective Twitter account requires regular attention. Our twitter management services include: monitoring the account and Twitter in general, responding to specific comments from followers, responding to general comments related to our client’s business and adding new followers. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Consulting Keyword Strategy Proper keyword selection is the foundation of any good search engine effort. We run predictive queries to determine the level of search traffic and go after terms that have sufficient search volume. Potential for conversion is evaluated against the level of search traffic. Our goal is to get the site high quality traffic, not just quantity. We evaluate the competitiveness of the keywords to be targeted. The level of competitiveness of our client’s keywords helps us to evaluate which In-page and Off- page strategies that will be necessary to get results. 25 In-page Strategy We review the website to implement changes that are required for the site to rank well for the terms identified in the Keyword Strategy. We examine what impediments are preventing search engine spiders from crawling the site and how they can be rectified. Content Strategy / Authority Building: Quality content is one of the fundamental keys to attracting relevant quality links from other sites, and therefore in securing superior search engine rankings. Quality content is the only strategy condoned by Google, Yahoo, and Bing. With the advent of Universal Search, many types of content now exist, and provide opportunities to rank. Some opportunities are: a. textual content b. images/picture c. videos d. user ratings and reviews e. widgets and calculators f. user generated content g. press releases/news h. location on a map (Google Local) When done properly, content is not only distinctive, but can position the author as an authority in his/her space. Being viewed as an authority has many advantages, including the attraction of many more opportunities related to quality relevant links. Plan of Operations We expect to complete our offering within three to six months from the effective date of our registration statement. To date, we have focused on providing individualized services to clients on a contract basis. Our plan over the next twelve months is to expand our client base, to develop a suite of subscription-based services that will allow us to generate a steady stream of revenue and to incorporate online ad management services to our services offered. We plan to develop a suite of subscription-based services to offer to our existing clients and to new customers starting in the fourth quarter of 2011. The scope of services offered will depend on the amount raised through this offering. If we raise the minimum amount, we plan to develop and offer the following services: a) Website Optimization Monthly Package. In order to receive the most effective results from website optimization, SEO solutions should be implemented and refined on an ongoing basis. Regular optimization efforts are very important, as search engines are known for revising their algorithms. We plan to offer 3-4 different packages of monthly website optimization services, based on service hours provided. The allotment of hours may be used towards solutions such as keyword research, SEO copywriting, optimized website coding, naming strategy improvements, internal link building or inbound link building. We expect to spend approximately $2,500 to develop this service. 26 b) Ad Serving and Management. Our customers may want to serve online ads on their website, or may need to implement a Pay Per Click advertising campaign to advertise their goods and services. We plan to develop a range of services to address both publishers (websites that serve ads from ad networks) and advertisers needs. By purchasing a monthly subscription package, a Liberty Vision client will get custom designed ads, whether text-only or graphic banners, management, scheduling and prioritizing of their ads, and implementation with online ad serving solutions such as Google DoubleClick for Publishers or Google Adwords. We expect to spend approximately $30,000 to develop this range of services. If we do not sell the minimum amount of shares, we will be forced to indefinitely postpone the development and launch of these services. If we raise the maximum amount, we plan to develop and offer the Website Optimization Monthly Package and Ad Serving and Management services, as well as, hire a full-time web developer and a part-time graphic designer. We expect these hires to cost approximately $120,000 per year. All future hiring will be subject to financing and sufficient cash flow from operations. If we raise the minimum amount of proceeds from this offering we may not be able to hire additional employees. Additionally, we plan to develop a suite of services that will allow a customer to design, build and publish their own website using a simple interface that does not require any knowledge of HTML coding. We expect to spend approximately $300,000 on this project and launch it within 2 years of completion of the offering, if we raise the maximum amount. The project will consist of a standalone website that will feature monthly subscription-based websites that the user can create, edit and publish using a simple intuitive interface. Long-term Plan of Operations Our long-term, five-year plan is to expand our client base, introduce new services subject to financing and sufficient cash flow from operations, and continue marketing our services to potential clients. There is no assurance we will be successful in completing our short-term plan of operations or achieving profitable operations necessary to implement our long-term plan. Financing We intend to raise a minimum of $50,000 and up to a maximum of $500,000 of gross proceeds from this Offering. Management believes that if we raise the minimum amount we will have sufficient cash flow to implement our short-term business plan and to meet our capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. Management expects to keep operating costs to a minimum until cash is available through financing or operating activities. If we are unable to generate profits or unable to obtain additional funds for our working capital needs, we may need to cease or curtail operations.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company as of February 28, 2011 and 2010, and for the year ended February 28, 2011, and for the period from September 29, 2009 (inception) through February 28, 2010, and cumulative from inception. LVMI is included as of February 28, 2011 and for the period from September 29, 2009 (date of formation) through February 28, 2011 . All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Development stage company The Company is a development stage company as defined by section 915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification . Although the Company has recognized sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs, the Company is still devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business. All retained earnings accumulated since inception have been considered as part of the Company’s development stage activities. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reporting amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Significant estimates include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, software copyright and technology. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fiscal year end The Company elected February 28 as its fiscal year end date. Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company’s existing F-7 accounts receivable. The Company determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience, customer specific facts and economic conditions. Bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expenses, if any. At February 28, 2011, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts. Outstanding account balances are reviewed individually for collectability. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure to its customers. Property and equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated under the straight line method over each item's estimated useful life. At February 28, 2011 and 2010 the Company had an office equipment balance of $3,518 and $Nil. No depreciation expense was recorded for 2011 and 2010 since the equipment was purchased at the end of fiscal 2011. Fair value of financial instruments The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification are described below: Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data. The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, prepaid rent, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis, consequently, the Company did not have any fair value adjustments for assets and liabilities measured at fair value at February 28, 2011; no gains or losses are reported in the consolidated statement of operations that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date for the year ended February 28, 2011, for the period from September 29, 2009 (inception) through February 28, 2010, and cumulative since inception. Commitments and contingencies The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Revenue recognition The Company applies paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company derives its revenues from sales contracts with its F-8 customer with revenues being generated upon rendering of services. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement is demonstrated via invoice; service is considered provided when the service is delivered to the customers; and the sales price to the customer is fixed upon acceptance of the purchase order and there is no separate sales rebate, discount, or volume incentive. Foreign currency transactions The Company applies the guidelines as set out in Section 830-20-35 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Section 830-20-35”) for foreign currency transactions. Pursuant to Section 830-20-35 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, foreign currency transactions are transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollar, the Company’s reporting currency. Foreign currency transactions may produce receivables or payables that are fixed in terms of the amount of foreign currency that will be received or paid. A change in exchange rates between the reporting currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected amount of reporting currency cash flows upon settlement of the transaction. That increase or decrease in expected reporting currency cash flows is a foreign currency transaction gain or loss that generally shall be included in determining net income for the period in which the exchange rate changes. Likewise, a transaction gain or loss (measured from the transaction date or the most recent intervening balance sheet date, whichever is later) realized upon settlement of a foreign currency transaction generally shall be included in determining net income for the period in which the transaction is settled. The exceptions to this requirement for inclusion in net income of transaction gains and losses pertain to certain intercompany transactions and to transactions that are designated as, and effective as, economic hedges of net investments and foreign currency commitments. Pursuant to Section 830-20-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the following shall apply to all foreign currency transactions of an enterprise and its investees: (a) at the date the transaction is recognized, each asset, liability, revenue, expense, gain, or loss arising from the transaction shall be measured and recorded in the functional currency of the recording entity by use of the exchange rate in effect at that date as defined in section 830-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification; and (b) at each balance sheet date, recorded balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency or reporting currency of the recording entity shall be adjusted to reflect the current exchange rate. Income taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company adopted the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification . Paragraph 740-10-25-13 .addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under paragraph 740-10-25-13 , the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13 . Net income (loss) per common share Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. There were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding at the reporting date for the year ended February 28, 2011, for the period from September 29, 2009 (inception) through February 28, 2010, and cumulative since inception. F-9 Cash flows reporting The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (Indirect method) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification . Subsequent events The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued . Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR. Recently issued accounting pronouncements In January 2010, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-06 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements , which provides amendments to Subtopic 820-10 that requires new disclosures as follows: 1. Transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2. A reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers. 2. Activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. In the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements (that is, on a gross basis rather than as one net number). This Update provides amendments to Subtopic 820-10 that clarify existing disclosures as follows: 1. Level of disaggregation. A reporting entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities. A class is often a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in the statement of financial position. A reporting entity needs to use judgment in determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities. 2. Disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques. A reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. Those disclosures are required for fair value measurements that fall in either Level 2 or Level 3. This Update also includes conforming amendments to the guidance on employers' disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets (Subtopic 715-20). The conforming amendments to Subtopic 715-20 change the terminology from major categories of assets to classes of assets and provide a cross reference to the guidance in Subtopic 820-10 on how to determine appropriate classes to present fair value disclosures. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-13,  CompensationStock Compensation (Topic 718): Effect of Denominating the Exercise Price of a Share-Based Payment Award in the Currency of the Market in Which the Underlying Equity Security Trades (ASU 2010-13). This update provides amendments to Topic 718 to clarify that an employee share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entitys equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market, performance, or service condition. Therefore, an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity. The amendments in ASU 2010-13 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2010. F-10 In August 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-21, Accounting for Technical Amendments to Various SEC Rules and Schedules: Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Release No. 33-9026: Technical Amendments to Rules, Forms, Schedules and Codification of Financial Reporting Policies (ASU 2010-21) , was issued to conform the SECs reporting requirements to the terminology and provisions in ASC 805, Business Combinations , and in ASC 810-10, Consolidation . ASU No. 2010-21 was issued to reflect SEC Release No. 33-9026, Technical Amendments to Rules, Forms, Schedules and Codification of Financial Reporting Policies, which was effective April 23, 2009. The ASU also proposes additions or modifications to the XBRL taxonomy as a result of the amendments in the update. In August 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-22, Accounting for Various Topics: Technical Corrections to SEC Paragraphs (ASU 2010-22) , which amends various SEC paragraphs based on external comments received and the issuance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 112, which amends or rescinds portions of certain SAB topics. The topics affected include reporting of inventories in condensed financial statements for Form 10-Q, debt issue costs in conjunction with a business combination, sales of stock by subsidiary, gain recognition on sales of business, business combinations prior to an initial public offering, loss contingent and liability assumed in business combination, divestitures, and oil and gas exchange offers. In December 2010, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-28 IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350): When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts (ASU 2010-28). Under ASU 2010-28, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative, an entity must assess whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists. To make that determination, an entity should consider whether there are adverse qualitative factors that could impact the amount of goodwill, including those listed in ASC 350-20-35-30. As a result of the new guidance, an entity can no longer assert that a reporting unit is not required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test because the carrying amount of the reporting unit is zero or negative, despite the existence of qualitative factors that indicate goodwill is more likely than not impaired. ASU 2010-28 is effective for public entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010, with early adoption prohibited. In December 2010, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-29 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations (ASU 2010-29). ASU 2010-29 specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. The amendments in this Update also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures under Topic 805 to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. The amended guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to Directors or officers under Nevada law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
