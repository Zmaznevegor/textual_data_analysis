There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the offering to proceed, and we will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered shares. The offering is being conducted on a self-underwritten, best efforts basis, which means our President, Barbara Walaszek, will attempt to sell the shares. This Prospectus will permit our President to sell the shares directly to the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to her for any shares she may sell. In offering the securities on our behalf, she will rely on the safe harbor from broker-dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The shares will be offered at a fixed price of $0.03 per share for a period of two hundred and forty (240) days from the effective date of this prospectus.

THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. TRANCE GLOBAL ENTERTAINMENT GROUP CORP. We are a development stage company and our business is distribution of Inflatable Products. Trance Global Entertainment Group Corp. was incorporated in Nevada on March 31, 2011. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations (See Description of Business and Use of Proceeds). To implement our plan of operations we require a minimum of $48,000 for the next twelve months as described in our Plan of Operations. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. After twelve months period we may need additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at Kusocinskiego 3, Torun, 87-100, Poland. Our phone number is + 48505259170. From inception until the date of this filing, we have had very limited operating activities. Our financial statements from inception (March 31, 2011) through January 31, 2012, reports no revenues and a net loss of $4,511. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for Trance Global Entertainment Group Corp. which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, we have developed our business plan and executed Contract with F.P.H.U "ADMAR", where we engage "ADMAR as an independent contractor for the specific purpose of developing, manufacturing and supplying products for us. As of the date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our securities will ever develop. THE OFFERING The Issuer: TRANCE GLOBAL ENTERTAINMENT GROUP CORP. Securities Being Offered: 3,000,000 shares of common stock. Price Per Share: $0.03 Duration of the Offering: The shares will be offered for a period of two hundred and forty (240) days from the effective date of this prospectus. Our offering will terminate as of the earlier of that date, when all the shares have been sold or when the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interest of the Company to terminate the offering prior the completion of the sale of all 3,000,000 shares registered under the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is part. Gross Proceeds $90,000 Securities Issued and Outstanding: There are 3,500,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus, held by our sole officer and director, Barbara Walaszek Registration Costs We estimate our total offering registration costs to be approximately $8,000. Risk Factors See Risk Factors and the other information in this prospectus for a discussion of the factors you should consider before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. 5 SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION The tables and information below are derived from our audited financial statements for the period from March 31, 2011(Inception) to January 31, 2012. Financial Summary January 31, 2012 ($) (Audited) Cash and Deposits 3,573 Total Assets 3,573 Total Liabilities 4,584 Total Stockholders Deficit (1,011) Statement of Operations Accumulated From March 31, 2011 (Inception) to January 31, 2012 ($) (Audited) Total Expenses 4,511 Net Loss for the Period (4,511) Net Loss per Share - RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock, when and if we trade at a later date, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. RISKS ASSOCIATED TO OUR BUSINESS WE ARE SOLELY DEPENDENT UPON THE FUNDS TO BE RAISED IN THIS OFFERING TO START OUR BUSINESS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE REVENUES AND PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. Our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations in the distribution of inflatable products. We need the proceeds from this offering to commence activities that will allow us to begin seeking financing of our business plan. As of January 31, 2012, we had cash in the amount of $3,573 and liabilities of $4,584. As of this date, we have had limited operations and no income. The proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations. We may need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE COMMENCED LIMITED OPERATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We were incorporated on March 31, 2011 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We have commenced limited business operations. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new distribution companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. Prior to distribution of inflatable products, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail. 6 WE HAVE YET TO EARN REVENUE AND OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE FINANCING. OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT HAS EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. We have accrued net losses of $4,511 for the period from our inception on March 31, 2011 to January 31, 2012, and have no revenues as of this date. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations in the inflatable products distribution business. Further, the finances required to fully develop our plan cannot be predicted with any certainty and may exceed any estimates we set forth. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. Silberstein Ungar, PLLC our independent registered public accounting firm, has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise. If we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed, we will not be able to complete our business plan. As a result we may have to liquidate our business and you may lose your investment. You should consider our independent registered public accountants comments when determining if an investment in Trance Global Entertainment Group Corp. is suitable. We require minimum funding of approximately $48,000 to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year. If we are not able to raise this amount, or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from Barbara Walaszek, our officer and director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees, including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses. However, Ms. Walaszek has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. After one year we may need additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. If we are successful in raising the funds from this offering, we plan to commence activities to start our operations. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to start our operations. THE EFFECT OF THE RECENT ECONOMIC CRISIS MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. The recent global crisis has caused disruption and extreme volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy, and has impacted levels of consumer spending. These macroeconomic developments may affect our business, operating results or financial condition in a number of ways. For example, our potential customers may never start spending with us, may have difficulty paying us or may delay paying us for previously purchased services. A slow or uneven pace of economic recovery would negatively affect our ability to start our distribution business and obtain financing. BECAUSE WE WILL PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS FROM OVERSEAS, A DISRUPTION IN THE DELIVERY OF IMPORTED PRODUCTS MAY HAVE A GREATER EFFECT ON US THAN ON OUR COMPETITORS. We will import our product from Poland. Because we import our product and deliver it directly to our customers, we believe that disruptions in shipping deliveries may have a greater effect on us than on competitors who manufacture and/or warehouse products in the destination countries. Deliveries of our products may be disrupted through factors such as: (1) raw material shortages, work stoppages, strikes and political unrest; (2) problems with ocean shipping, including work stoppages and shipping container shortages; (3) increased inspections of import shipments or other factors causing delays in shipments; and (4) economic crises, international disputes and wars. Most of our competitors warehouse products they import from overseas, which allows them to continue delivering their products for the near term, despite overseas shipping disruptions. If our competitors are able to deliver products when we cannot, our reputation may be damaged and we may lose customers to our competitors. 7 IF WE DO NOT ATTRACT CUSTOMERS, WE WILL NOT MAKE A PROFIT, WHICH ULTIMATELY WILL RESULT IN A CESSATION OF OPERATIONS. We currently have no customers to buy inflatable products from us. We have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee we ever will have any customers. Even if we obtain customers, there is no guarantee that we will generate a profit. If we cannot generate a profit, we will have to suspend or cease operations. You are likely to lose your entire investment if we cannot sell our inflatable products at prices which generate a profit. WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE WITH OUR COMPETITORS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competition includes large, small and midsized companies, and many of them may distribute similar inflatable products in our markets at competitive prices. Highly competitive environment could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WILL OWN 53.85% OR MORE OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, IF MAXIMUM OFFERING SHARES ARE SOLD, THEY WILL MAKE AND CONTROL CORPORATE DECISIONS THAT MAY BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS. If maximum offering shares will be sold, Ms. Walaszek, our sole officer and director, will own 53.85 % of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, they will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of Ms. Walaszek may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders. BECAUSE OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT HAS OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS, SHE MAY NOT BE ABLE OR WILLING TO DEVOTE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIME TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, CAUSING OUR BUSINESS TO FAIL. Barbara Walaszek, our President, currently devotes approximately twelve hours per week providing management services to us. While she presently possesses adequate time to attend to our interest, it is possible that the demands on her from other obligations could increase, with the result that she would no longer be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business. The loss of Ms. Walaszek to our company could negatively impact our business development. IF BARBARA WALASZEK, OUR PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR, SHOULD RESIGN OR DIE, WE WILL NOT HAVE A CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER THAT COULD RESULT IN OUR OPERATIONS SUSPENDING. IF THAT SHOULD OCCUR, YOU COULD LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT. We extremely depend on the services of our president and director, Barbara Walaszek, for the future success of our business. The loss of the services of Ms. Walaszek could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If she should resign or die we will not have a chief executive officer. If that should occur, until we find another person to act as our chief executive officer, our operations could be suspended. In that event it is possible you could lose your entire investment. BECAUSE COMPANYS HEADQUARTER AND ASSETS ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, U.S. INVESTORS MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES IN ATTEMPTING TO EFFECT SERVICE OF PROCESS AND TO ENFORCE JUDGMENTS BASED UPON U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND ITS NON-U.S. RESIDENT SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR. While we are organized under the laws of State of Nevada, our sole officer and Director are non-U.S. resident and our headquarters and assets are located outside the United States. Consequently, it may be difficult for investors to affect service of process on them in the United States and to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in United States courts against them based on the civil liability provisions of the United States securities laws. Since all our assets will be located outside U.S. it may be difficult or impossible for U.S. investors to collect a judgment against us. 8 ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING WE ARRANGE THROUGH THE SALE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WILL RESULT IN DILUTION TO EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS. We must raise additional capital in order for our business plan to succeed. Our most likely source of additional capital will be through the sale of additional shares of common stock. Such stock issuances will cause stockholders' interests in our company to be diluted. Such dilution will negatively affect the value of an investor's shares. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING OUR PRESIDENT, MS. WALASZEK DOES NOT HAVE ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE CONDUCTING A BEST-EFFORT OFFERING, AND OUR BEST EFFORT OFFERING DOES NOT REQUIRE A MIMIMUM AMOUNT TO BE RAISED. AS A RESULT OF THIS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ENOUGH FUNDS TO COMMENCE AND SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. Ms. Walaszek does not have any experience conducting a best-effort offering. Consequently, we may not be able to raise any funds successfully. Also, the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised. If we are not able to raise sufficient funds, we may not be able to fund our operations as planned, and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to successfully conduct a best-effort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us. THE TRADING IN OUR SHARES WILL BE REGULATED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULE 15G-9 WHICH ESTABLISHED THE DEFINITION OF A PENNY STOCK. The shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $3,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES. This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to sell our shares through our President, who will receive no commissions. There is no guarantee that she will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless she is successful in selling all of the shares and we receive the proceeds from this offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan. DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING. We are not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB). The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities. The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements per se, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. Market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings between Trance Global Entertainment Group Corp. and anyone acting on our behalf, with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment. 9 WE WILL INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE. WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL. The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000. We will have to utilize funds from Barbara Walaszek, our officer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. After the effective date of this prospectus, we will be required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, or other information with the SEC as provided by the Securities Exchange Act. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. The costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next 12 months will be approximately $10,000. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. Also, if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAVE NO EXPERIENCE MANAGING A PUBLIC COMPANY WHICH IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. We have never operated as a public company. Barbara Walaszek, our sole officer and director, has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations, which are required for a public company. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to operate as a public company could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend, and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us as described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus. USE OF PROCEEDS Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per share is $0.03. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of one-third, two-third and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $90,000 as anticipated. Gross proceeds $30,000 $60,000 $90,000 Legal and professional fees $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 Establishing an office $ 3,000 $ 4,000 $ 5,000 Website development $ 3,500 $ 4,500 $ 6,000 Product development $ 18,000 $ 25,000 $ 32,000 Marketing and advertising $ 5,500 $ 15,000 $ 30,000 Hire salesperson $ - $ - $ 5,000 Miscellaneous expenses $ - $ 1,500 $ 2,000 The above figures represent only estimated costs. If necessary, Barbara Walaszek, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. Also, these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when/if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Ms. Walaszek will not be repaid from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Ms. Walaszek. Ms. Walaszek will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation. 10 DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities. DILUTION The price of the current offering is fixed at $0.03 per share. This price is significantly higher than the price paid by the Companys officer for common equity since the Companys inception on March 31, 2011. Barbara Walaszek, the Companys president and director, paid $.001 per share for the 3,500,000 shares of common stock she purchased from the Company. Dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders. The following tables compare the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing stockholders. As of January 31, 2012, the net tangible book value of our shares of common stock was $(1,011) or approximately $0 per share based upon 3,500,000 shares outstanding.

We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Barbara Walaszek, our Chairman and President, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. Ms. Walaszek, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period, we require a minimum of $48,000 of funding from this offering. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. After twelve months period we may need additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at Kusocinskiego 3, Torun, 87-100, Poland. Our phone number is + 48505259170. If we do not receive any proceeds from the offering the minimum amount of $48,000 we require to operate for the next 12 months may be loaned to us by Ms. Walaszek, who has informally agreed to advance us funds, however, she has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage. To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. We believe that we will be able to raise enough money through this offering to start our proposed operations but we cannot guarantee that once we start operations we will stay in business after doing so. If we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering. If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Even if we raise $90,000 from this offering, it will last one year, but we may need more funds for business operations in the next year, and we will have to revert to obtaining additional money. PLAN OF OPERATION Barbara Walaszek, our president will be devoting approximately 30% of her time to our operations. Once we begin operations, and are able to attract more and more customers to buy our product, Ms. Walaszek has agreed to commit more time as required. Because Ms. Walaszek will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to her. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a cessation of operations. We need to raise funds from this offering to satisfy our cash requirements during the next 12 months. Before we raise the said funds, if the need for cash arises, we may be able to borrow funds from our director although there is no such formal agreement in writing. We do not expect to purchase or sell plant or significant equipment. Further we do not expect significant changes in the number of employees. Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to profitably sell our product. Our 12 month plan of operations once we raise funds from this offering is as follows: Time Frame: 1 st Month Milestone: Office set up Minimum Cost: $3,000 We plan to set up our office and equip it with the basic office equipment. We will use the office to conduct our day to day business operations such as telephone calls, paperwork, general administrative duties, and hold sample brochures. Time Frame: 2-4 th Month Milestone: Website development Minimum Cost: $3,500 13 We plan to hire a web designer to design our website. Our website will have the following links: About us and our products, Contact information, Ordering option, Tech page of our products, and Links to videos displaying our products. Throughout the lifetime of operations we will be updating and improving our website. Time Frame: 5-10 th Month Milestone: Marketing and advertising Minimum Cost: 7,000 Trance Global plans to advertise through trade shows. Our intention is to develop and maintain a database of potential customers who may want to purchase inflatable products from us. We will follow up with these clients periodically, send them our new catalogues and offer them presentations and special discounts from time to time. We plan to print catalogues and flyers and mail them to potential customers. Our team intends to use marketing strategies, such as web advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers. We intend to spend at least $7,000 on marketing efforts during the first year. Marketing is an ongoing matter that will continue during the life of our operations. Time Frame: 3-6 th Month Milestone: Development and manufacturing of the product Minimum Cost: $18,000 During this period, ADMAR., our supplier will develop and manufacture products which we are going to distribute according to our specifications. Trance Global will take part in this stage as ADMAR will use our groundwork and recommendations in its development and manufacturing. Our cost of development of the products: Inflatable Game (average) - $2,500 Inflatable Advertising (average) - $1,700 Tent (average) - $1,300 Total: $5,500 Time Frame: 6-12 th Month Milestone: Establish relationship with Distributors and Operators We have identified some distributors of inflatable products intend to market directly to these distributors upon completion of Public Offering. During this time we will be contacting potential clients and making presentation of our product to them with view of executing distribution agreements with them. Time Frame: 8-12 th Month Milestone: Hire a Salesperson(s) Minimum Cost: $5000 If we sell all shares in this offering, we intend to hire one salesperson with experience and established network in the entertainment industry. The salespersons job would be to find new potential customers, and to execute agreements with them to buy our inflatable product. Estimated salary cost is approximately $5,000. Additional earnings to the salesperson will be paid in form of commission payments from the sales generated. Estimated Expenses for the Next Twelve Month Period The following provides an overview of our estimated expenses to fund our plan of operation over the next twelve months. Legal and Professional fees Establishing an office Website development and testing Marketing and advertising Product development Hire a Salesperson Other Expenses 10,000 3,000 3,500 7,000 18,000 5,000 1,500 Total 48,000 We should start to generate revenue after 6 th month of operations. During 1 st -6 th months we should have established our office, developed our website and prepared our inflatable product ready for sale. During months 6-12 we will be developing our marketing campaign and expanding our clientele base. There is now assurance that we will generate any revenue in the first 12 months after completion our offering. 14 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. Results of operations From Inception on March 31, 2011 to January 31, 2012 During the period we incorporated the company, prepared a business plan and executed Contract with F.P.H.U "ADMAR", where we engage "ADMAR as an independent contractor for the specific purpose of developing, manufacturing and supplying products for us. Our loss since inception is $4,511. We have not meaningfully commenced our proposed business operations and will not do so until we have completed this offering. Since inception, we have sold 3,500,000 shares of common stock to our sole officer and director for net proceeds of $ 3,500. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of January 31, 2012, the Company had $3,573 cash and our liabilities were $4,584, comprising $3,500 owed to our independent auditor and $1,084 owed to Barbara Walaszek, our president and director. The available capital reserves of the Company are not sufficient for the Company to remain operational. Since inception, we have sold 3,500,000 shares of common stocks to our sole officer and director, at a price of $0.001 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $3,500. We are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operation. We will have to utilize funds from Barbara Walaszek, our officer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. However, Ms. Walaszek has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. Our current cash on hand will be used to pay the fees and expenses of this offering. To proceed with our operations within 12 months, we need a minimum of $48,000.We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our 12 months financial requirement. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operation. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $10,000. We are highly dependent upon the success of the private offerings of equity or debt securities, as described herein. Therefore, the failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital from other resources such as taking loans, which would likely not even be possible for the Company. However, if such financing were available, because we are a development stage company with no operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds, the Company would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors would lose all of their investment. 15 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Company reports revenues and expenses using the accrual method of accounting for financial and tax reporting purposes. USE OF ESTIMATES Management uses estimates and assumption in preparing these financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND CAPITALIZATION The Company records depreciation and amortization when appropriate using both straight-line and declining balance methods over the estimated useful life of the assets (five to seven years). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions, major renewals and replacements that increase the propertys useful life are capitalized. Property sold or retired, together with the related accumulated depreciation is removed from the appropriated accounts and the resultant gain or loss is included in net income. INCOME TAXES We account for income taxes as required by the Income Tax Topic of the FASB ASC, which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires the Company to disclose, when reasonably attainable, the fair market values of its assets and liabilities which are deemed to be financial instruments. The Companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash. PER SHARE INFORMATION The Company computes per share information by dividing the net loss for the period presented by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during such period.

We intend to present at a major amusement industry trade show within 7-12 months since the completion of Public Offering. Average trade show cost is expected to approximate $3,500 for a booth and $1,000 to deliver goods.

Magazines: Your Guide Euro Slot Fun World Inter Games 17 Transport Product availability is also a key component of sales, especially when it comes to revenue-generating equipment. We have researched delivery methods, cost and estimated delivery times to all major markets. Based on the fact that first manufactured units will be produced in Poland, we anticipate 10-20 days delivery to any distributor in Europe and Middle East and 20-30 day to South/North America. Average cost of shipping of the 20 foot container in Europe is $2,000  3,000 US. Average cost of shipping of the 20 foot container to South/North America is $4,500  5,500 US.

Competition There are few barriers of entry in the inflatable products distribution business and level of competition is extremely high. There are many domestic and international distributors of inflatable products. We will be in direct competition with existing distributors of inflatable products and any new market entrants. Many large distributors have greater financial capabilities than us and will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers. Many of these companies may have a greater, more established customer base than us. We will likely lose business to such companies. Also, many of these companies will be able to afford to offer greater price for similar inflatable products than us which may also cause us to lose business. 18 Insurance We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation.

Burnaby, BC, Canada We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Trance Global Entertainment Group Corp. (the Company) as of January 31, 2012 and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the period from March 31, 2011 (Date of Inception) through January 31, 2012. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Trance Global Entertainment Group Corp. as of January 31, 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from March 31, 2011 (Date of Inception) through January 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has limited working capital, has not yet received revenue from sales of products or services, and has incurred losses from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans with regard to these matters are described in Note 2. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ Silberstein Ungar, PLLC Bingham Farms, Michigan April 9, 2012 F-1 25 TRANCE GLOBAL ENTERTAINMENT GROUP CORP.

F-5 29 RANCE GLOBAL ENTERTAINMENT GROUP CORP. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JANUARY 31, 2012 NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization and Description of Business Trance Global Entertainment Group Corp. (the Company or Trance Global) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 31, 2011. Development Stage Company The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles related to development stage companies. A development-stage company is one in which planned principal operations have not commenced or if its operations have commenced, there has been no significant revenues there from. Basis of Presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. Accounting Basis The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP accounting). The Company has adopted a January 31 fiscal year end. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had $3,753 of cash as of January 31, 2012. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accrued expenses and loans payable due to a related party. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements. Income Taxes Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured. F-6 30 TRANCE GLOBAL ENTERTAINMENT GROUP CORP. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JANUARY 31, 2012 NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. Basic Income (Loss) Per Share Basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Companys net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Companys net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no such common stock equivalents outstanding as of January 31, 2012. Comprehensive Income The Company has which established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. When applicable, the Company would disclose this information on its Statement of Stockholders Equity. Comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company has not had any significant transactions that are required to be reported in other comprehensive income. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Global does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flow. NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $4,511 as of January 31, 2012 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and or private placement of common stock. NOTE 3  ACCRUED EXPENSES Accrued expenses at January 31, 2012 consisted of amounts owed to the Companys outside independent auditors for services rendered for periods reported on in these financial statements. NOTE 4  LOANS PAYABLE  RELATED PARTY An officer and shareholder loaned $1,084 to the Company during the period ended January 31, 2012. The amount is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. F-7 31 TRANCE GLOBAL ENTERTAINMENT GROUP CORP. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JANUARY 31, 2012 NOTE 5  CAPITAL STOCK The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $ 0.001 per share. On January 27, 2012, the Company issued 3,500,000 shares of its common stock at $0.001 per share for cash proceeds of $3,500. There were 3,500,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2012. NOTE 6  COMMITMENTS The Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property. An officer has provided office services without charge. There is no obligation for the officer to continue this arrangement. Such costs are immaterial to the financial statements and accordingly are not reflected herein. The officers and directors are involved in other business activities and most likely will become involved in other business activities in the future. NOTE 7  INCOME TAXES As of January 31, 2012, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $4,511 that may be available to reduce future years taxable income in varying amounts through 2032. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards. The provision for Federal income tax consists of the following for the period from March 31, 2011 (Inception) to January 31, 2012: 2012 Federal income tax attributable to: Current Operations $ 1,533 Less: valuation allowance (1,533) Net provision for Federal income taxes $ 0 The cumulative tax effect at the expected rate of 34% of significant items comprising our net deferred tax amount is as follows as of January 31, 2012: 2012 Deferred tax asset attributable to: Net operating loss carryover $ 1,533 Less: valuation allowance (1,533) Net deferred tax asset $ 0 Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $4,511 for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years.

Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. (5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or our securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act) may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 35 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized in the City of Torun, Poland, on April 16, 2012.
