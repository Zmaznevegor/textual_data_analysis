Corporate Background and Business Overview Winecom Inc. is a development stage company. We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on July 1, 2008 and are engaged in the development of a social networking website for wine lovers, Winecom.ning.com. Our fiscal year end is December 31, and we have no subsidiaries. Our social networking website aims to provide people with a platform to share their wine experiences and expertise, manage their wine collections, and interact with a community of wine lovers from around the world. Our business offices are currently located at 2 Duchifat Street, Kibbutz Dovrat, D.N Emek Yezreel 19325, Israel. The address of agent for service in Nevada and registered corporate office is c/o EastBiz.com, Inc., 5348 Vegas Dr., Las Vegas, NV 89108 USA. Our telephone number is 011 (972) 57-946-2208. We have a website located at www.winecom.ning.comn, however, the information contained on our website does not form a part of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. From our inception on July 1, 2008 to October 2008, we have focused on organizational matters. Due to the continuing financial crisis in 2008 we suspended our operations in October 2008, resuming them in September 2009. Since September 2009 we have been developing our social networking website for wine lovers, www.winecom.ning.com. Our website is currently in the development stage. We expect our website to be ready for public launch within 6 months following completion of this Offering, provided that the Offering allows us to raise sufficient capital. If we are successful in completing and launching our website, we anticipate that we will generate nominal revenues within 4 to 6 months following the website launch. We have two executive officers, Mr. Mordechay David and Mr. Shamir Benita, who also serve as our directors. Both Mr. David and Mr. Benita reside in Israel. Mr. David, our President and director, is a wine professional with more than 22 years of experience as a winemaker working at the Binyamina Winery, the fourth largest winery in Israel. Mr. Shamir Benita, our Secretary, Treasurer, and director, has 5 years of general business management, marketing, and logistics experience working in the public education sector. We are a development stage company that has generated no revenues and has had limited operations to date. From July 1, 2008 (date of inception) to April 30, 2010, we have incurred accumulated net losses of $2,112. As of April 30, 2010, we had $20,706 in current assets and current liabilities of $2,818. We have sold and issued an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of our common stock since our inception through the private placement of our common stock exclusively to our officers and directors, Mr. Mordechay David and Mr. Shamir Benita, for total proceeds of approximately $20,000. Since our inception we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets, nor have we been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations. Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating and capital expenses, our independent auditors have included a going concern opinion in their report on our audited financial statements for the period ended April 30, 2010. The notes to our financial statements contain additional disclosure describing the circumstances leading to the issuance of a going concern opinion by our auditors. 6 Summary of the Offering Shares of common stock being offered by the Registrant: A minimum of 1,000,000 shares (the Minimum Offering) and up to a maximum of 1,500,000 shares (the Maximum Offering) of the Registrants common stock. Offering price: $0.04 per share of common stock. Number of shares outstanding before the Offering: As of June 1, 2010 we had 4,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, and no issued and outstanding convertible securities. Number of shares outstanding after the Offering, if all the shares are sold: 5,000,000 upon the sale of Minimum Offering or 5,500,000, if the Maximum Offering is sold. Market for the common stock: There is no public market for our common stock. After the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, we intend to seek a market maker to file an application on our behalf to have our common stock quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. We currently have no market maker who is willing to list quotations for our stock. There is no assurance that a trading market for our stock will develop be sustained if developed Use of Proceeds: If we are successful in selling the 1,000,000 shares contained in the Minimum Offering our gross proceeds will be $40,000. If we are also successful in selling the 500,000 additional shares contained in the Maximum Offering, our gross proceeds will total $60,000. We intend to use all the proceeds received from this Offering to execute our business plan. Risk Factors: See the Risk Factors beginning on page 9 and the other information in this prospectus for a discussion of the factors you should consider before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. Dividend Policy: We have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception, and we do not anticipate paying any such dividends for the foreseeable future. 7 Summary Financial Data The following summary financial information for the period from July 1, 2008 (date of inception) through April 30, 2010, includes statement of expenses and balance sheet data from our audited financial statements. The information contained in this table should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this prospectus. Our financial status creates substantial doubt whether we will continue as a going concern. Statement of Operations Period from Inception (July 1, 2008) to April 30, 2010 Revenues $ 0 Total expenses 2,112 Net loss 2,112 Balance Sheet Data April 30, 2010 Total assets $ 20,706 Total liabilities $ 2,818 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 20,706 8 RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information in this prospectus before deciding to invest in our Company. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for growth could be seriously harmed. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Relating to Our Business There is uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern, indicating the possibility that we may be required to curtail or discontinue our operations in the future. If we discontinue our operations, you may lose all of your investment. We have incurred net losses of $2,112 from our inception on June 1, 2008 to April 30, 2010 and have completed only the preliminary stages of our business plan. We anticipate incurring additional losses before realizing any revenues and will depend on additional financing in order to meet our continuing obligations and ultimately, to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business. If we are unable to obtain additional financing from outside sources and eventually produce enough revenues, we may be forced to sell our assets, or curtail or discontinue our operations. If this happens, you could lose all or part of your investment. As a company in the early stage of development with an unproven business strategy, our limited history of operations makes evaluation of our business and prospects difficult. We were incorporated on July 1, 2008. Our website, which we intend to be our sole vehicle for generating revenues, is incomplete. We have no customers, and we have not earned any revenues to date. Our business prospects are difficult to predict because of our limited operating history, early stage of development, and unproven business strategy. Our primary business activities will be focused on the development of our social networking website, www.winecom.ning.com. Although we believe that our business plan has significant profit potential, we may not attain profitable operations and our management may not succeed in realizing our business objectives. Our business will fail if we are unable to complete the development of our social networking website or implement our business plan successfully. The success of our business plan depends on our successful and timely development of our social networking website, www.winecom.ning.com. We may not be able to develop this website successfully or in a timely manner. In addition, the success of our business plan depends on the market acceptance of our website and the services it offers. Our business will fail if we can not successfully develop our website or successfully market our website and the services it offers. We expect to suffer losses in the immediate future that may cause us to curtail or discontinue our operations. We expect to incur operating losses in future periods. These losses will occur because we do not yet have any revenues to offset the expenses associated with the development of our social networking website and our business operations, generally. We cannot guarantee that we will ever be successful in generating revenues in the future. We recognize that if we are unable to generate revenues, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide investors with no assurance that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will almost certainly fail. We have limited sales and marketing experience, which increases the risk t that our business will fail. Our officers, who will be responsible for marketing our website to potential users, have no experience in the social media or internet industries, and have only nominal sales and marketing experience. Further, we have budgeted only $10,000 toward sales and marketing efforts over the next 12 months, which by industry standards is a very limited amount of capital with which to launch our effort. Given the relatively small marketing budget and limited experience of our officers, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. Further, if our initial efforts to create a market for our website are not successful, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified individuals with marketing and sales expertise to attract subscribers to our website. Our future success will depend, among other factors, upon whether our services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire, adopt, and continue to use them. There can be no assurance that our website will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services. 9 We may not be able to execute our business plan or stay in business without additional funding. Our ability to generate future operating revenues depends in part on whether we can obtain the financing necessary to implement our business plan. We will likely require additional financing through the issuance of debt and/or equity in order to establish profitable operations, and such financing may not be forthcoming. As widely reported, the global and domestic financial markets have been extremely volatile in recent months. If such conditions and constraints continue or if there is no investor appetite to finance our specific business, we may not be able to acquire additional financing through credit markets or equity markets. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms favorable to us. At this time, we have not identified or secured sources of additional financing. Our failure to secure additional financing when it becomes required will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business. If our estimates related to future expenditures are erroneous or inaccurate, our business will fail and you could lose your entire investment. Our success is dependent in part upon the accuracy of our managements estimates of our future cost expenditures for legal and accounting services (including those we expect to incur as a publicly reporting company), for website marketing and development expenses, and for administrative expenses, which management estimates to be approximately between $25,000 and $45,000 over the next twelve months. If such estimates are erroneous or inaccurate, or if we encounter unforeseen costs, we may not be able to carry out our business plan, which could result in the failure of our business and the loss of your entire investment. Any significant disruption in our website presence or services could result in a loss of customers. Our plans call for our customers to access our service through our website. Our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers will be dependent upon the reliable performance of our website, network infrastructure and fulfillment processes (how we deliver services purchased by our customers). Prolonged or frequent interruptions in any of these systems could make our website unavailable or unusable, which could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential customers. Our servers will likely be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, which could lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations and loss, misuse or theft of data. It is likely that our website will periodically experience directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service, which is not uncommon for web-based businesses. Any attempts by hackers to disrupt our website service or our internal systems, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. Efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services. Any significant disruption to our website or internal computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We are in a competitive market which could impact our ability to gain market share which could harm our financial performance. The business of niche social networking websites is very competitive. Barriers to entry on the Internet are relatively low, and we face competitive pressures from numerous companies that have existed and been successful in this general market space for many years. There are a number of successful websites operated by proven companies that offer niche social networking to wine lovers, which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful. These competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base, and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service. If we cannot gain enough market share, our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected. We are a small company with limited resources relative to our competitors and we may not be able to compete effectively. The niche social networking websites of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater resources and name recognition, and a larger base of customers than we have. As a result, these competitors will have greater credibility with our potential customers. They also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their services than we may be able to devote to our services. . Therefore, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may fail. 10 We need to retain key personnel to support our product and ongoing operations. The development of our website and the marketing of our services will continue to place a significant strain on our limited personnel, management, and other resources. Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers who are developing our business, and on our ability to identify and retain competent consultants and employees with the skills required to execute our business objectives. The loss of the services of either of our officers or our failure to timely identify and retain competent personnel could negatively impact our ability to develop our website and sell our services, which could adversely affect our financial results and impair our growth. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock There is currently no public market for our securities, and there can be no assurance that any public market will develop or that our common stock will be quoted for trading. There has been no public market for our securities and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for the securities offered herein will develop or be sustained after this Offering. . After the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, we intend to identify a market maker to file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to have our common stock quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. We must satisfy certain criteria in order for our application to be accepted. We do not currently have a market maker willing to participate in this application process, and even if we identify a market maker, there can be no assurance as to whether we will meet the requisite criteria or that our application will be accepted. Our common stock may never be quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board or a public market for our common stock may not materialize if it becomes quoted. If our securities are not eligible for initial or continued quotation on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board or if a public trading market does not develop, purchasers of the common stock in this Offering may have difficulty selling or be unable to sell their securities should they desire to do so, rendering their shares effectively worthless and resulting in a complete loss of their investment. Because we will be subject to penny stock rules once our shares are quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, the level of trading activity in our stock may be reduced. Broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on some national securities exchanges). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer to deliver to its customers a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market prior to carrying out a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules,. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealers presumed control over the market, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. In addition, broker-dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction. Consequently, these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules. If a trading market does develop for our common stock, these regulations will likely be applicable, and investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares. FINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock. FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for certain customers. FINRA requirements will likely make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in our common stock. As a result, fewer broker-dealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock, reducing a stockholders ability to resell shares of our common stock. State securities laws may limit secondary trading, which may restrict the states in which you can sell the shares offered by this prospectus. If you purchase shares of our common stock sold pursuant to this Offering, you may not be able to resell the shares in a certain state unless and until the shares of our common stock are qualified for secondary trading under the applicable securities laws of such state or there is confirmation that an exemption, such as listing in certain recognized securities manuals, is available for secondary trading in such state. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in registering or qualifying our common stock for secondary trading, or identifying an available exemption for secondary trading in our common stock in every state. If we fail to register or qualify, or to obtain or verify an exemption for the secondary trading of, our common stock in any particular state, the shares of common stock could not be offered or sold to, or purchased by, a resident of that state. In the event that a significant number of states refuse to permit secondary trading in our common stock, the market for the common stock will be limited which could drive down the market price of our common stock and reduce the liquidity of the shares of our common stock and a stockholders ability to resell shares of our common stock at all or at current market prices, which could increase a stockholders risk of losing some or all of his investment. 11 If quoted, the price of our common stock may be volatile, which may substantially increase the risk that you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price that you may pay for the shares. Even if our shares are quoted for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board following this Offering and a public market develops for our common stock, the market price of our common stock may be volatile. It may fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors: • variations in quarterly operating results; • our announcements of significant contracts and achievement of milestones; • our relationships with other companies or capital commitments; • additions or departures of key personnel; • sales of common stock or termination of stock transfer restrictions; • changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, if any; and • fluctuations in stock market price and volume. Your inability to sell your shares during a decline in the price of our stock may increase losses that you may suffer as a result of your investment. Our insiders beneficially own 100% of our issued and outstanding stock, and accordingly, have control over stockholder matters, the Companys business and management. As of June 1, 2010, our executive officers and directors beneficially own 4,000,000 shares of our common stock in the aggregate, or 100% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Mr. Mordechay David, our President and director, owns 50% or 2,000,000 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock. Mr. Shamir Benita, our Treasurer, Secretary and director, owns 50% or 2,000,000 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock. Following this Offering, if: - the Minimum Offering offered pursuant to this prospectus is sold, each Mr. David and Mr. Benita will own approximately 40% of our issued and outstanding common stock, and collectively they will own approximately 80% of our issued and outstanding common stock. - the Maximum Offering offered pursuant to this prospectus is sold, each Mr. David and Mr. Benita will own approximately 36.36% of our issued and outstanding common stock, and collectively they will own approximately 72.72% of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our executive officers and directors will have significant influence to: • control the election and composition of our board of directors; • amend or prevent any amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws; • effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and • affect the outcome of any other matter submitted to the stockholders for vote. 12 Moreover, because of the significant ownership position held by our executive officers and directors, new investors will not be able to effect a change in our business or management, and therefore, shareholders would be subject to decisions made by our officers and directors in their capacity as managers or as majority shareholders. In addition, sales of significant amounts of shares held by our directors and executive officers, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Managements stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price. We arbitrarily determined the price of the shares of our common stock to be sold pursuant to this prospectus, and such price may not reflect the actual market price for the securities. The initial offering price of $0.04 per share of the common stock offered pursuant to this prospectus was determined by us arbitrarily. The price is not based on our financial condition or prospects, on the market prices of securities of comparable publicly traded companies, on financial and operating information of companies engaged in similar activities to ours, or on general conditions of the securities market. The price may not be indicative of the market price, if any, for our common stock in the trading market after this Offering. The market price of the securities offered herein, if any, may decline below the initial public offering price. The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against various companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. If instituted against us, regardless of the outcome, such litigation would result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources, which would increase our operating expenses and affect our financial condition and business operations. Because we do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock; holders of our common stock must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment. We have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception, and we do not anticipate paying any such dividends for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, holders of our common stock will have to rely on capital appreciation, if any, to earn a return on their investment in our common stock. The sale of our common stock pursuant to this prospectus or any future additional issuances of our s common stock may result in immediate dilution to existing shareholders. We are authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 4,000,000 shares are issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus. We are issuing a minimum of 1,000,000 shares and a maximum of up to 1,500,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to this prospectus. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without the consent of any of our stockholders, to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock, and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges attached to such shares. The sale of our common stock pursuant to this prospectus, and any future additional issuances of our common stock will result in immediate dilution to our existing shareholders interests, which may have a dilutive impact on our existing shareholders, and could negatively affect the value of your shares. 13 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements and information relating to our business that are based on our beliefs, on assumptions made by us, or upon information currently available to us.

USE OF PROCEEDS The net proceeds to us from the sale of a minimum of 1,000,000 shares and a maximum of up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock offered at a public offering price of $0.04 per share will vary depending upon the total number of Shares actually sold. Regardless of the number of shares sold, we expect to incur Offering expenses estimated at approximately $12,500.00 for legal, accounting, printing, and other costs in connection with this Offering. The table below sets forth the net proceeds that we will receive from this Offering in the event that we sell either the Minimum Offering or the Maximum Offering. This table does not set forth all possibilities. There is no guarantee that we will be successful at selling any of the securities being offered in this prospectus. Accordingly, the actual amount of proceeds we will raise in this Offering, if any, may differ. Minimum Maximum Shares Sold 1,000,000 1,500,000 Gross Proceeds $ 40,000 $ 60,000 Less offering expenses $ 12,500 $ 12,500 Net offering proceeds $ 27,500 $ 47,500 Our offering expenses of approximately $12,500 are comprised primarily of legal and accounting expenses, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and EDGAR filing fees, printing and transfer agent fees, and any necessary state registration fees. Our officers and directors will not receive any compensation for their efforts in selling our shares. Any net proceeds from this Offering will be used for the development and marketing of our business and products, and for general working capital, during the twelve months following the successful completion of this Offering. In all instances, after the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, we will require some amount of working capital to maintain our basic operations and comply with our public reporting obligations. In addition to changing our allocation of cash because of the amount of proceeds received, we may change the use of proceeds because of changes in our business plan. Investors should understand that we have wide discretion over the use of proceeds. 14 CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth, as of April 30, 2010, the capitalization of the Company on an actual basis, and the capitalization of the Company as adjusted to give effect to the sale of the Minimum Offering and the Maximum Offering of common stock being offered hereby at the initial public offering price of $0.04 per share and the application of the estimated net proceeds as described in Use of Proceeds. This table should be read in conjunction with the more detailed financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein. April 30, 2010 As Adjusted, As Adjusted, Assuming Assuming Sale Sale of of Minimum Maximum Actual Offering Offering Short-term debt 2,818 2,818 2,818 Stockholders equity : Preferred Stock, 50,000,000 shares authorized, par-value $0.0001, no shares issued and outstanding 4,000,00 5,000,000 5,500,000 Common Stock, 100,000,000 shares authorized, par-value $0.0001, 4,000,000 shares issued and outstanding. 0 Issued and outstanding as adjusted 400 500 550 Additional paid-in capital 19,600 39,500 59,450 Deficit accumulated during the development stage (2,112 ) (2,112 ) (2,112 ) Total stockholders equity 17,888 37,888 57,888 Total Capitalization 20,706 40,706 60,706 DILUTION Purchasers of our securities in this Offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of their common stock to the extent of the difference between the public offering price per share of our common stock and the adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock after this Offering. The historical net tangible book value as of April 30, 2010 was $17,888 or approximately $0.0045 per share. Historical net tangible book value per share of common stock is equal to our total tangible assets less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of April 30, 2010. Dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share represents the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers of shares of our common stock in this Offering and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately following this Offering. Adjusted net tangible book value represents the historical net tangible book value as of December 31, 2009, as adjusted to give effect to the receipt of net proceeds of $27,500 or $47,500 from the sale of 1,000,000 shares or 1,500,000 shares of common stock, respectively, after deducting estimated Offering expenses of approximately $12,500. The adjusted net tangible book value represents an immediate increase of $0.0045 per share upon the sale of 1,000,000 shares or $0.0073 per share upon the sale of 1,500,000 shares to existing stockholders, and an immediate and substantial dilution of $0.031 per share (approximately 77.5%) upon the sale of 1,000,000 shares or $0.0282 per share (approximately 70.5%), upon the sale of 1,500,000 shares to new investors purchasing our securities in this Offering. 15 DETERMINATION OF THE OFFERING PRICE There is no established public market for our shares of common stock. The offering price of $0.04 per share was determined by us arbitrarily. We believe that this price reflects the appropriate price that a potential investor would be willing to invest in our Company at this initial stage of our development. This price bears no relationship whatsoever to our business plan, the price paid for our shares by our founders, our assets, earnings, book value or any other criteria of value. The offering price should not be regarded as an indicator of the future market price of the securities, which is likely to fluctuate. See Plan of Distribution for additional information. DIVIDEND POLICY We have not paid any dividends since our incorporation and do not anticipate the payment of dividends in the foreseeable future. At present, our policy is to retain any earnings to develop and market our services. The payment of dividends in the future will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, capital requirements, and operating financial conditions. MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK Market Information There is no established public market for our common stock. After the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, we intend to seek a market maker to file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, to have our common stock quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. We will have to satisfy certain criteria in order for our application to be accepted. We do not currently have a market maker who is willing to participate in this application process, and even if we identify a market maker, there can be no assurance as to whether we will meet the requisite criteria or that our application will be accepted. Our common stock may never be quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, or, even if quoted, a public market may not materialize. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for our shares will develop, or, if developed, that it will be sustained. We have issued 4,000,000 shares of our common stock since our inception on July 1, 2008. There are no outstanding options, warrants, or other securities that are convertible into shares of common stock. Holders There were 2 holders of record of our common stock as of June 1, 2010. Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans We do not have any compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized for issuance. DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS OVERVIEW Winecom Inc. is a development stage company that was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on July 1, 2008. We currently have no revenues and no significant assets. We are developing and plan to offer a social networking website that focuses on building online communities of wine lovers. Our website will allow wine lovers to chat, post pictures and videos, share wine expertise and experiences, create and share events, and manage their wine collections. Our website, available at www.winecom.ning.com, is accessible but is still a work-in-progress and in the development stage. Provided we raise sufficient proceeds from the Offering, we expect our website to be fully developed with all planned functions and features and to be ready for public launch within 6 months following completion of this Offering. 16 We are in the early stage of our business plan. We currently have no revenues and no user subscriptions for our website. Our activities to date have been limited to organizational matters, development of our business plan, development of our website, and efforts related to becoming a publicly traded company. Our offices are currently located at 2 Duchifat Street, Kibbutz Dovrat, D.N Emek Yezreel 19325, Israel, which office has been donated free of charge from our Secretary and director, Mr. Shamir Benita. The address of agent for service in Nevada and registered corporate office is c/o EastBiz.com, Inc., 5348 Vegas Dr., Las Vegas, NV 89108 USA. Our telephone number is 011 (972) 57-946-2208. We have a website at www.winecom.ning.com, however, the information contained on our website does not form a part of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. We have two executive officers who also serve as our directors. Mr. Mordechay David, our President and Director, has more than 15 years of experience as a winemaker working at the Binyamina Winery, Israels fourth largest wine producer. Mr. Shamir Benita our Secretary, Treasurer, and Director, general business management, marketing, and logistics experience working in the public education sector. Both Mr. David and Mr. Benita reside in Israel. We have never declared bankruptcy, never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since becoming incorporated, we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets, nor have we been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations. Neither Winecom Inc., nor our officers, directors, promoters or affiliates, has had preliminary contact or discussions with, nor do we have any present plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with any representatives of the owners of any business or company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger. SOCIAL NETWORKING WEBSITES, GENERALLY Social networking websites provide internet users with services that allow them to form, join, or participate in online communities and to communicate with others regarding common interests and pursuits. Social networking websites have experienced increasing popularity in the last decade, and many sites have grown into broad networks encompassing tens of millions of users. Our management believes that the popularity of general interest social networking sites such as Facebook has opened the door for more specialized and exclusive services that cater to special interest groups. OUR WEBSITE We have acquired web hosting space for our website at the cost of $30 per month. Our website, available at www.winecom.ning.com is accessible but is still a work-in-progress and in the development stage To date our website has the following functions and services: MEMBER PROFILES Subscribers can customize their profile pages with their own design, choice of widgets and profile applications, and may choose to make their profile public or private to other subscribers. LATEST ACTIVITY A real-time, dynamic activity feed of everything happening across our website including status updates from subscribers. PHOTOS AND VIDEOS Subscribers can upload and share photos and videos. CHAT AND DISCUSSION FORUM Chat in real-time with other subscribers and single or multi-threaded discussion forum with categories, photos and attachments. We plan to develop the following function immediately after the Offering is completed and the proceeds have been received and accepted: 17 WINE COLLECTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Allowing subscribers to manage and track their wine collection, the system can produce an instant, detailed inventory of a collection and sort it, for instance, by grower, region or drink-by date. Provided that we raise sufficient proceeds from this Offering, we plan to develop the following functions within 6 months after the Offering is completed: INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES Allowing members of other popular social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn to join our website with their current username without the need to register as new members on our website. Once on our website the members will be able to purchase a subscription to our premium services. TRANSLATE TO A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE Enabling our website visitors to select a display our website in a different languages, we plan to include Deutsch, French and Spanish. REVENUE MODEL We plan to generate revenue from the following: PREMIUM SERVICES Visitors to our website will be able review posts and search general sections of the website for free. However, members will be charged $4.99 per month if they would like to use our premium services such as wine collection managing system, more storage space and extra features. The extra features available to subscribers of our premium services will include the ability to start a personal blog on our website, for example. ADVERTISEMENT SPACE One of the major benefits of advertising on a social networking site is that advertisers can take advantage of the users demographic information and target their ads appropriately. We intend to sell advertisement space to companies who are interested in targeting our subscribers. We anticipate that interested advertisers will include winemakers and retailers, purveyors of gourmet foods, and suppliers of lifestyle products and services catering to our target market. We intend to sell advertising space on our website at a rate of $15 to $50 per thousand instances of an ad appearing on the website. Advertisements will appear on all of our web pages in a vertically oriented sidebar. We also intend to participate in the Google AdSense service. Google AdSense is a free service, which displays text-only ads that correspond to the keywords of the content of the page on which the ad is shown. Each time a user of a host website clicks on an AdSense advertisement, Google provides a flat fee to the operators of that website on behalf of the applicable advertiser. We have not yet applied to participate in the Google Ad Sense program, but intend to do so once our website has been publicly launched. THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY According to eMarketer, an aggregator of worldwide market research, in a report on Social Network Demographics and Usage dated May 2010, social network usage rose sharply in 2009 largely due to the ever-increasing popularity of Facebook. eMarketer estimates that 57.5% of Internet users, or 127 million people, will use a social network at least once a month in 2010. By 2014, nearly two-thirds of all Internet users, or 164.9 million people, will be regular users of social networks. Adults will continue to increase their use of social networks, driving most of the growth in the next few years. This year, 59.2% of adults online will visit social networks regularly, up from 52.4% in 2009. By 2014, 139.6 million US adults will be regular users, up 56% over 2009. Similarly, the market for wine and gourmet related media has grown exponentially over the past decade with the advent of networks such as Food Television, the Food Channel®, Food Network (for example) and numerous printed magazines covering culinary and wine related topics. Our management believes that the strong and stable demand for social networking websites and for wine and gourmet related media indicates the presence of a large consumer market for niche, wine related social networking websites like ours. 18 COMPETITION AND COMPETITIVE STRATEGY The social networking website industry is highly competitive and, at times, subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences and industry trends. Competition is generally a function of brand strength, assortment and continuity of merchandise selection, reliable order fulfillment and delivery, and level of brand support and customer support. We will be required to compete with a large number of niche social networking websites, many of which have significantly greater resources than we do. Many of our competitors also have the ability to develop and market products and services similar to (and competitive with) our products and services. Specifically, we compete with the major niche social networking websites such as snooth, Bottlenotes, corkd, VINFOLOIO, calwineries and WineQ. We also compete with several smaller niche social websites brands such as Adegg, OpenBottles and Tastoria. We believe that we are currently one of the smallest in the industry, as we currently have only a nominal web presence and no revenues from our business operations. Management believes we can offset any such competitive disadvantages by being a price leader in the marketplace, first by offering free access to our website, and thereafter by offering more competitively priced premium services. Initially, general subscriptions to our site will be free and premium subscriptions will be only approximately $4.99 per month. We will also seek to differentiate ourselves by providing our subscribers with more attractive social network features, such as tools for subscribers to easily communicate with each other. MARKETING & SALES STRATEGY The use of Internet is continuing to evolve as a global platform for doing business. Our major focus in the first year will be to use Google Adwords program in order to drive traffic to our own website. We plan to take advantage of the well established Google Adwords marketing program which places online ads on the search result pages of Internet users. Google uses an advertising methodology referred to as cost-per-click (CPC) in its Adwords program. Using this strategy will allow us to design our own ads, and to select target locations such as a city or state and use keywords in our ads. A keyword is a word that is used by an Internet user who is performing an online search to find out information on a specific topic. Our primary target market is focused on Internet users who already participate in social networking websites. With CPC advertising, we only pay for the number of actual clicks on our advertisement. Each time someone clicks on our Google ad they will be redirected to our web site. A CPC-based advertising strategy is cost effective because an advertiser only pays for the leads they receive. The CPC marketing campaign is an integral part of our long term strategy Our marketing campaign will monitor daily statistics and track favorite topics in order to quickly get in synch with our Internet audience. This is a significant part of our branding strategy. ONLINE ADVERTISING The majority of our advertising and promotional activities will be concentrated on an online advertising campaign using Google Adwords. We have selected Google because of its success and popularity for web users wishing to find something using an internet search. The Google Adwords program will allow us to customize the text of our advertisements, the frequency of each advertisement's appearance, and the length of the advertising contract. For our purposes, we believe that this will give us the maximum amount of flexibility and allow us to closely monitor the costs of the marketing campaign. EMAIL ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN We anticipate that an information style email advertising campaign may help to enhance our online advertising campaign and bring us into direct contact with people who are interested in using our services. In this regard, we are considering acquiring email lists, which may be done on an incremental basis so as not to incur a large expense before determining whether an email campaign works and meets our expectations. 19 We have budgeted a minimum of $5,000 and a maximum of $10,000 for advertising, marketing and sales during the 12 months following completion of this Offering. Mr. Shamir Benita will be responsible to manage all of our marketing and sales activities. OPTIMIZING OUR WEBSITE We plan to work with the web site development contractor to develop a series of meta-tags for each of the pages of our web site. Meta-tags are keywords that are added to a web page to make it easier to find that specific web page through search engines, web browser software and other applications. The information is not intended to be seen by the casual Internet user. Search engines like Google and Yahoo are designed to seek out these keywords when someone is performing an Internet search for a specific topic. By including meta-tags such as social networking website for wine lovers, love wine community and chat and share knowledge about wine, we will be able to help drive more traffic to our web site. As our business begins to gain subscribers and become known in the industry we plan to conduct our own online survey questionnaires from the home page of our web site. SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS AND SUPPLIES We will be developing our own website, and the distribution of our website services will be over the Internet. We intend to engage the services of independent contractors in relation to web design and programming as we may require. We believe there are no constraints on the sources or availability of products, supplies, or suppliers related to our business. DEPENDENCE ON ONE OR A FEW MAJOR CUSTOMERS Our website will be available to the general public over the Internet. Initially, general subscriptions will be free, and premium subscriptions will be approximately $4.99 per month. As our subscription fees will be priced for mass market consumption, we do not anticipate dependence on one or a few major customers for the foreseeable future. PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES, FRANCHISE RESTRICTIONS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS & CONCESSIONS We have not entered into any franchise agreements or other contracts that have given, or could give rise to, obligations or concessions. We are planning to develop our website and intend to protect its contents by registering for appropriate copyright and trademark protection where our management deems such registration necessary or beneficial. We have not conducted any independent searches or other inquiry into patents or other intellectual property which may be owned by others and which may constrain our business plan, nor have we received independent opinions of counsel on such matters. Beyond our trade name, we do not hold any other intellectual property rights. EFFECT OF EXISTING OR PROBABLE GOVERNMENT REGULATION. We do not believe that government regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. Given the alcohol related content that will be available on our website, we will implement appropriate safeguards and electronic warnings to ensure that visitors to our site are aware of any age related restrictions that may be applicable to them while visiting our site. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND COSTS We have not incurred any research and development costs to date. We have plans to undertake certain research and development activities during the first year of operation related to the development of our website. For additional details please see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Plan of Operation" below. 20 EMPLOYEES We have commenced only limited operations, and therefore currently have no employees other than our officers/directors, who each spend up to approximately 15-20 hours a week on our business. We will consider retaining full-time management and administrative support personnel as our business and operations increase. We do not foresee engaging full-time management or administrative support personnel during the next 12 months. Over the next 12 months, Mr. Mordechay David will be primarily responsible for: - General management of our company's operations - Management and direction of financing activities - Ensuring the software development plan is on budget and on schedule - Overseeing the wine collection management system project development - Responsible for the discussion boards conception and policies. Mr. Shamir Benita will be responsible for: - Preparing and updating our website - Financing activities - Setting up a Google Adwords account - Identify, interview and select software developer for the wine collection management system - Overseeing the wine collection management system project development - Promote and executing our marketing plan DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY We do not own interests any real property. Mr. Shamir Benita, our Treasurer, Secretary and director, has provided us with 500 sq ft of furnished office space located at 2 Duchifat Street, Kibbutz Dovrat, D.N Emek Yezreel 19325, Israel free of charge for at least the next 12 months. This location currently serves as our primary office for planning and implementing our business plan. This space is currently sufficient for our purposes, and we expect it to be sufficient for the foreseeable future. We also maintain a resident corporate office at 5348 Vegas Dr., Las Vegas, Nevada, 89108. This location is a virtual office that we maintain for $75 per month pursuant to a lease with INC Management, a company affiliated with EastBiz.com, Inc. which provides us with a mailing address for communications, a contact phone number as well as secretarial and administrative services should we need it. Our officers/directors do not work from this location. We may terminate the lease arrangement upon 30 days written notice to INC. Management. Finally, we have also contracted with a third party web-hosting service to obtain server space and maintenance for our website at the minimal cost of $30 per month. REPORTS TO SECURITY HOLDERS We are not currently a reporting company, but upon effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will be required to file reports with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These reports include annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. You may obtain copies of these reports from the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, on official business days during the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. or on the SECs website, at www.sec.gov. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. MANAGEMENT The name, age and position of each of our directors and executive officers are as follows: 21 Name Age Position Mr. Mordechay David 58 President, and Director Mr. Shamir Benita 31 Treasurer, Secretary and Director Mr. Mordechay David Mr. David is our President and director and has served in these capacities since July 1, 2008. Since November 1988, Mr. David has been employed at the Binyamina Winery in Israel, where he has been responsible for identifying aromas and flavors in wines, for recommending treatments to improve wine quality and for achieving wine flavor profiles which meet marketing needs. At Binyamina, Mr. David has also been responsible for various aspects of the wine production and cellaring process, including management of grapes, juices and wines, chemical and ingredient additions, racks, transfers, clarification, blends, shipping and final preparation for bottling. Mr. Shamir Benita Mr. Benita is Our Treasurer, Secretary and director, and has served on our Board of Directors since July 1, 2008. Since July of 2005 Mr. Benita has been employed by the Micheal Project, a supplemental addition to the Israeli education system supported by the Israeli Ministry of Education and implemented in Junior High Schools and High Schools in the Jewish, Arab, Druze and Bedouin educational sectors. Mr. Benita has been responsible for managing the logistical aspects of the Micheal Project. In addition, since August of 2007, Mr. Benita has been a consultant to small businesses such as tamarziv.com and fit2media.com in the area of marketing and sales. Board Composition Our Bylaws provide that the Board of Directors shall consist of no less than 1, but not more than 9 directors. Each director serves until his successor is elected and qualified. Committees of the Board of Directors We do not presently have a separately constituted audit committee, compensation committee, nominating committee, executive committee or any other committees of our Board of Directors. Nor do we have an audit committee financial expert. As such, our entire Board of Directors acts as our audit committee and handles matters related to compensation and nominations of directors. Potential Conflicts of Interest Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions. We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or directors. Director Independence We are not subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or national securities association and, as a result, we are not at this time required to have our board comprised of a majority of independent directors. Our determination of independence of directors is made using the definition of independent director contained in Rule 4200(a) (15) of the Marketplace Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ), even though such definitions do not currently apply to us because we are not listed on NASDAQ. We have determined that none of our directors currently meet the definition of independent as within the meaning of such rules as a result of their current positions as our executive officers. 22 Significant Employees We have no significant employees other than the executive officers/directors described above. Family Relationships There are no familial relationships between our officers and directors. Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings No director, person nominated to become a director, executive officer, promoter or control person of our company has, during the last five years: (i) been convicted in or is currently subject to a pending a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to any federal or state securities or banking or commodities laws including, without limitation, in any way limiting involvement in any business activity, or finding any violation with respect to such law, nor (iii) any bankruptcy petition been filed by or against the business of which such person was an executive officer or a general partner, whether at the time of the bankruptcy or for the two years prior thereto. Stockholder Communications with the Board We have not implemented a formal policy or procedure by which our stockholders can communicate directly with our Board of Directors. Nevertheless, every effort has been made to ensure that the views of stockholders are heard by the Board of Directors or individual directors, as applicable, and that appropriate responses are provided to stockholders in a timely manner. We believe that we are responsive to stockholder communications, and therefore have not considered it necessary to adopt a formal process for stockholder communications with our Board. During the upcoming year, our Board will continue to monitor whether it would be appropriate to adopt such a process. 23 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION We have not paid since our inception, nor do we owe, any compensation to our executive officers, Mr. Mordechay David. There are no arrangements or employment agreements with our executive officer or directors pursuant to which they will be compensated now in the future for any services provided as an executive officer, and we do not anticipate entering into any such arrangements or agreements with them in the foreseeable future. Outstanding Equity Awards at 2009 Fiscal Year-End We do not currently have a stock option plan or any long-term incentive plans that provide compensation intended to serve as incentive for performance. No individual grants of stock options or other equity incentive awards have been made to any executive officer or any director since our inception; accordingly, none were outstanding at June 1, 2010. Employment Contracts, Termination of Employment, Change-in-Control Arrangements There are currently no employments or other contracts or arrangements with our executive officers. There are no compensation plans or arrangements, including payments to be made by us, with respect to our officers, directors or consultants that would result from the resignation, retirement or any other termination of such directors, officers or consultants from us. There are no arrangements for directors, officers, employees or consultants that would result from a change-in-control. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS We have not entered into any transaction nor are there any proposed transactions in which any of our directors, executive officers, stockholders or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing had or is to have a direct or indirect material interest. Our officers and directors may be considered promoters of the Company due to their participation in and management of the business since our incorporation. PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of June 1, 2010 for: • each person, or group of affiliated persons, known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock; • each of our executive officers; • each of our directors; and • all of our executive officers and directors as a group. We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities. The person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Unless otherwise indicated, the persons or entities identified in this table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them, subject to applicable community property laws, and the address for each person listed in the table is c/o Winecom Inc., 2 Duchifat Street, Kibbutz Dovrat, D.N Emek Yezreel 19325, Israel. 24 The percentage ownership information shown in the table below is calculated based on 4,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of June 1, 2010. We do not have any outstanding options, warrants or other securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock.

We do not have any issued and outstanding securities that are convertible into common stock. None of our stockholders are entitled to registration rights. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION, TERMS OF THE OFFERING There Is No Current Market for Our Shares of Common Stock There is currently no market for our shares of common stock. We cannot give you any assurance that the shares you purchase will ever have a market or that if a market for our shares ever develops, that you will be able to sell your shares. In addition, even if a public market for our shares develops, there is no assurance that a secondary public market will be sustained. The shares you purchase are not traded or listed on any exchange or quotation medium. After the effective date of the registration statement, we intend to seek a market maker to file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, to have our common stock quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. We will have to satisfy certain criteria in order for our application to be accepted. We do not currently have a market maker who is willing to participate in this application process, and even if we identify a market maker, there can be no assurance as to whether we will meet the requisite criteria or that our application will be accepted. Our common stock may never be quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, or, even if quoted, a public market may not materialize. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for our shares will develop, or, if developed, that it will be sustained. The Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board is maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. The securities traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, these securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. Over-the-counter stocks are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange. 25 Even if our shares are quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, a purchaser of our shares may not be able to resell the shares. Broker-dealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in our shares because they will be considered penny stocks and will be subject to the penny stock rules. Rules 15g-1 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokers-dealers who make a market in a "penny stock." A penny stock generally includes equity securities (other than securities registered on some national securities exchanges) that have a market price of less than $5.00 per share. Under the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or "accredited investor" (generally, an individual with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. In addition, the penny stock regulations require the broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a broker-dealer is required to send monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the penny stock held in a customer's account and information with respect to the limited market in penny stocks. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon broker-dealers may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our shares, which could severely limit the market liquidity of the shares and impede the sale of our shares in the secondary market, assuming one develops. 26 The Offering will be Managed by Our Officers and Directors We are offering up to a minimum of 1,000,000 (the Minimum Offering) and a maximum of 1,500,000 (the Maximum Offering) shares of common stock. The offering price is $0.04 per share. The Offering will be for a period of 180 days from the effective date and may be extended for an additional 90 days if we choose to do so. In our sole discretion, we have the right to terminate the Offering at any time, even before we have sold the Minimum Offering, or, following the sale of the Minimum Offering, before we have sold the Maximum Offering. There are no specific events which might trigger our decision to terminate the Offering. Funds received for subscriptions of up to the Minimum Offering will be placed into escrow. In the event that subscriptions for all of the Minimum Offering are not received within 180 calendar days after the effective date, all money received by us and being held in escrow will be promptly returned to subscribers, without interest or deduction. The Offering may be discontinued or declared to be completed at any time by us. In the event that an action is taken by a creditor prior to our receipt of subscriptions for the Minimum Offering, such action could delay or even preclude us from refunding your money. In the event that subscriptions for at least the Minimum Offering are received within 180 day offering period, all money received and held in escrow will promptly be released to us, and we will use such funds in the execution of our business plan. In the event that less than the Minimum Offering is sold within the 180 day offering period and our Board of Directors believe that an extension of time would result in our receipt of subscriptions for the Minimum Offering, the Board may then decide, by majority vote to extend the Offering for 90 calendar days. All monies received in respect of rejected subscriptions will be returned immediately by us to the subscriber, without interest or deductions. Any subscriptions in excess of the Minimum Offering, up the number of Maximum Offering, will be accepted on a rolling basis. Once we accept subscriptions in excess of the Minimum Offering, the funds will be deposited into an account maintained by us and be immediately available to us. There are no investor protections for the return of subscription funds once the Minimum Offering are subscribed and accepted. Certificates for shares purchased will be issued and distributed by our transfer agent promptly after a subscription is accepted and "good funds" are received in our account. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds to effectuate our business plan, we will attempt to raise additional funds from a second public offering, a private placement, or loans. At the present time, we have not made any plans to raise additional funds and there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds in the future. If we need additional funds and are not successful, we will have to suspend or cease operations. Our officers and directors will manage the sale of the Shares in this Offering. The officers and directors will receive no commission from the sale of the shares nor will they register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in reliance upon Rule 3(a) 4-1. Rule 3(a) 4-1 sets forth those conditions under which a person associated with an issuer may participate in the offering of the issuer's securities and not be deemed to be a broker-dealer. Each of our officers and directors satisfies the requirements of Rule 3(a) 4-1 in that neither of them: 1. Are subject to a statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Act, at the time of their participation; 2. Are being compensated in connection with his participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities; 3. Are, at the time of his participation, an associated person of a broker- dealer; and 4. Meets the conditions of Paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Rule 3(a)4-1 of the Exchange Act, in that he (A) primarily perform, or is intended primarily to perform at the end of the offering, substantial duties for or on behalf of the issuer otherwise than in connection with transactions in securities; and (B) he is not a broker or dealer, or an associated person of a broker or dealer, within the preceding twelve (12) months; and (C) he does not participate in selling and offering of securities for any issuer more than once every twelve (12) months other than in reliance on Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(iii). 27 As our officers and directors will sell the shares being offered pursuant to this offering, Regulation M prohibits the Company and its officers and directors from certain types of trading activities during the time of distribution of our securities. Specifically, Regulation M prohibits our each of them from bidding for or purchasing any common stock or attempting to induce any other person to purchase any common stock, until the distribution of our securities pursuant to this offering has ended. We have no intention of inviting broker-dealer participation in this Offering. Offering Period and Expiration Date This Offering will commence on the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, as determined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and will continue for a period of 180 days. We may extend the Offering for an additional 90 days, at our sole discretion, unless the offering is completed or otherwise terminated by us at an earlier date.

Overview Winecom Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on July 1, 2008 and is engaged in the development of an Internet social website that caters to wine lovers. Our offices are currently located at 2 Duchifat Street, Kibbutz Dovrat, D.N Emek Yezreel 19325, Israel. Our telephone number is Tel: 011 (972) 57-946-2208. We have a website at www.winecom.ning.com , however, the information contained on our website does not form a part of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. From our inception on July 1, 2008 to October 2008, we have focused primarily on organizational matters. Due to the continuing financial crisis in 2008 we suspended our operations in October 2008, resuming them in September 2009. Since September 2009 we have been developing our website. We are developing and plan to offer a social networking website that focuses on building online communities of wine lovers. Our website will allow wine lovers to chat, post pictures/videos, share wine expertise and experiences, create and share events, and manage their wine collections. Our website, available at winecom.ning.com, is accessible but is still a work-in-progress and in the development stage. We expect our website to be ready for public launch within 6 months following completion of the Offering, provided that we raise sufficient capital to carry out our business plan. In our managements opinion the emerging alternatives to general social networking websites are niche social networking sites which are social networks targeted at a specific audience. By targeting a specific audience, niche social networks will be able to create a strong and lasting bond among their users. We believe, although no assurance can be given, that our plan to offer a niche social networking website for wine lovers is timely given the current market conditions. From July 1, 2008 (inception) to April 30, 2010, we have incurred accumulated net losses of $2,112. As of April 30, 2010, we had $20,706 in current assets and current liabilities of $2,818. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. We do not anticipate that we will generate revenues at least until we have completed and launched our website. 32 Plan of Operations We are developing and plan to offer a social networking website that focuses on building online communities of wine lovers, our website will allow wine lovers to chat, post pictures/videos, share knowledge about their favourite wine, create and share events and manage their wine collections. Our business objectives for the next 12 months (beginning upon completion of this Offering), provided the necessary funding is available, are to: * build the brand recognition of Winecom; * complete the development of our website; * create interest in our website; and * to establish our website as a one-stop-shop for wine lovers. Our goals over the next 12 months (beginning upon completion of this Offering) are to: * drive traffic to our website through marketing efforts, * set up a Google Ads account and place ads on our website; * integrate Facebook and Twitter with our website; * sell third-party goods on our website; and * achieve break-even results of operations. Activities to Date We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 1, 2008. We are a development stage company. From our inception to date, we have not generated any revenues and our operations have been limited to organizational matters related to the development of our business and our related to becoming a public company. Since September 2009 we have been developing a social networking website that caters to wine lovers. Our website is currently under development. We expect it to be fully developed with all intended functions and features and ready for public launch by August 2010, provided we raise sufficient financing in this Offering to carry out our business plan. Since our inception we have not made any purchases or sales, and we have not been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations. However, our management is of the opinion that: • The market is ready for the type of service we propose; • The technological challenges we expect to face are surmountable; and • The cost of implementation and delivery of our proposed service is modest for a company of our size. Our management has already begun discussions with legal counsel, transfer agent and Certified Public Accounting firm to ensure that we will meet all the compliance and disclosure requirements of being a public company. Mr. Benita, our Secretary, Treasurer and Director has provided us with an office space. 33 Expenditures The following chart provides an overview of our budgeted expenditures for the 12 months following the completion of this Offering.

We expect to begin generating revenues within the six months following the public launch of our website. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2008, we had total current assets of $0 (consisting entirely of cash), total current liabilities of $818, and negative working capital of $818.

During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, we raised an additional $2,000 in proceeds from a second loan from Mr. David. The loans from Mr. David is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due upon demand. Net cash provided by financing activities was $20,000 payments received from our Directors as payment for stock during the period ended April 30, 2010. We have no external sources of liquidity in the form of credit lines from banks. In the opinion of our management, additional funding is required to meet our development goals for the next twelve months. The estimated funding we require during the next twelve months period (beginning upon completion of this Offering) is between $27,500 and $47,500, which is the amount we expect to raise from the sale of our shares in this Offering. These estimated expenditures are described in detail above under the heading Expenditures. The length of time during which we will be able to satisfy our cash requirements depends on how quickly our company can generate revenue and how much revenue can be generated. We estimate that our current cash balances will be extinguished by December 31, 2010 provided we do not have any unanticipated expenses. Although there can be no assurance at present, we anticipate to be in a position to generate revenues beginning approximately 4 to 6 months following the launch of our website or approximately within 10 to 12 months from the completion of this Offering. 36 We have not yet generated any revenue from our operations. We will require additional funds to implement our plans. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. We will also need more funds if the costs of the development of our website costs greater than we have budgeted. We will also require additional financing to sustain our business operations if we are not successful in earning revenues. We currently do not have any arrangements regarding this Offering or following this Offering for further financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain further financing, the successful development of our website, a successful marketing and promotion program, attracting and, further in the future, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. As widely reported, the global and domestic financial markets have been extremely volatile in recent months. If such conditions and constraints continue, we may not be able to acquire additional funds either through credit markets or through equity markets. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms we find favorable. At this time, there are no anticipated sources of additional funds in place. Failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business. Going Concern We have incurred net losses of $2,112 from our inception on June 1, 2008 to April 30, 2010 and have completed only the preliminary stages of our business plan. We anticipate incurring additional losses before realizing any revenues and will depend on additional financing in order to meet our continuing obligations and ultimately, to attain profitability. Our ability to obtain additional financing, whether through the issuance of additional equity or through the assumption of debt, is uncertain. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements for the period ended April 30, 2010 include an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern, including additional information contained in the notes to our financial statements describing the circumstances leading to this disclosure. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements We do not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our net results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 37 WINECOM, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (JULY 1, 2008) TO APRIL 30, 2010 Page REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM F-2 BALANCE SHEETS F-3 STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS F-4 STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY F-5 STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS F-6 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-7 to F-11 F-1 REPORT OF REGISTERED INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Winecom, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Winecom, Inc. (a Nevada corporation in the development stage) as of April 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the periods ended April 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 and 2008, and from inception (July 1, 2008) through April 30, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Winecom, Inc. as of April 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the periods ended April 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and 2008, and from inception (July 1, 2008) through April 30, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company is in the development stage, and has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. As such, it has incurred an operating loss since inception. Further, as of as April 30, 2010, the cash resources of the Company were insufficient to meet its planned business objectives. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plan regarding these matters is also described in Note 7 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

F-6 WINECOM, INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS April 30, 2010 NOTE 1. GENERAL ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on July1, 2008. The Company has limited operations and is considered a development stage company and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations. We are focused on developing a social network website that caters to wine lovers. Our website focuses on building online communities of people who share interests, or who are interested in exploring the interests and activities of other members. Our vision is to create social network sites as a form of online community of people who share interests and activities or who are interested in exploring the interests and activities of others. As a development stage enterprise, the Company discloses the deficit accumulated during the development stage and the cumulative statements of operations and cash flows from inception to the current balance sheet date. NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRACTICES Basis of Accounting The Companys financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a Dec 31 fiscal year end. Earnings per Share The basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing our net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing our net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of the first of the year for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. F-7 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of the Companys financial instruments, consisting of accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturity of such instruments. Unless otherwise noted, it is managements opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial statements. Income Taxes A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Software Development Costs Software development costs representing capitalized costs of design, configuration, coding, installation and testing of the Companys website up to its initial implementation. Upon implementation, the asset will be amortized to expense over its estimated useful life of three years using the straight-line method. Ongoing website post-implementation costs of operation, including training and application maintenance, will be charged to expense as incurred. Recently issued accounting pronouncements In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly (FSP FAS 157-4), codified in FASB ASC 820-10-65, which provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with ASC 820-10 when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased. ASC 820-10-65 also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. The adoption of ASC 820-10-65 did not have an impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, "Subsequent Events" ("SFAS 165") codified in FASB ASC 855-10-05, which provides guidance to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. FASB ASC 855-10-05 also requires entities to disclose the date through which subsequent events were evaluated as well as the rationale for why that date was selected. FASB ASC 855-10-05 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. FASB ASC 855-10-05 requires that public entities evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued. In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance now codified as FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 105, "GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES," as the single source of authoritative non-governmental U.S. GAAP. FASB ASC Topic 105 does not change current U.S. GAAP, but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative U.S. GAAP by providing all authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place. All existing accounting standard documents will be superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the FASB Codification will be considered non-authoritative. These provisions of FASB ASC Topic 105 were effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009 and, accordingly, were effective for the Company for the current fiscal reporting period. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations, but will impact the Company's financial reporting process by eliminating all references to pre-codification standards. On the effective date of FASB ASC Topic 105, the Codification superseded all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards, and all other non-grandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification became non-authoritative. F-8 In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued updated guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. This update requires new disclosures on significant transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy (including the reasons for these transfers) and the reasons for any transfers in or out of Level 3. This update also requires a reconciliation of recurring Level 3 measurements about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis. In addition to these new disclosure requirements, this update clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements. For example, this update clarifies that reporting entities are required to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities rather than each major category of assets and liabilities. This update also clarifies the requirement for entities to disclose information about both the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. This update will become effective for the Company with the interim and annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which will become effective for the Company with the interim and annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2011. The Company will not be required to provide the amended disclosures for any previous periods presented for comparative purposes. Other than requiring additional disclosures, adoption of this update will not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, "Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)" ("SFAS 167"), codified as FASB ASC 810-10, which modifies how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. FASB ASC 810-10 clarifies that the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entity's purpose and design and a company's ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. FASB ASC 810-10 requires an ongoing reassessment of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. FASB ASC 810-10 also requires additional disclosures about a company's involvement in variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. FASB ASC 810-10 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The adoption of FASB ASC 810-10 did not have an impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE 3. INCOME TAXES The Company uses the liability method , where deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes. As of April 30, 2010, the Company incurred net losses and, therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved. The cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is $2,112 and will expire 20 years from the date the loss was incurred. As at April 30, 2010, deferred tax assets consisted of the following: Net operating losses $ 317 Less: valuation allowance (317 ) Net deferred tax asset - NOTE 4. NET OPERATING LOSSES As of April 30, 2010, the Company has a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $2,112 which will expire 20 years from the date the loss was incurred. F-9 NOTE 5. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY The Company has commenced a capital formation activity by filing a Registration Statement on Form S-1 to the SEC to register and sell in a self-directed offering 1,000,000 shares minimum or 1,500,000 maximum of newly issued common stock at an offering price of $0.04 per share for proceeds of $40,000 minimum or $60,000 maximum. Authorized The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001. All common stock shares have equal voting rights, are non-assessable and have one vote per share. Voting rights are not cumulative and, therefore, the holders of more than 50% of the common stock could, if they choose to do so, elect all of the directors of the Company. Issued and Outstanding For transactions with employees stock, issuances are in accordance with ASC 718, where issuances shall be accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received. Transactions with other than employees stock issuance are in accordance with ASC 505, where issuances shall be accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is the more reliable measure. On July1, 2008, the Company issued 4,000,000 common shares to its Directors valued at $ 0.005 per share or $20,000. NOTE 6. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The officers and directors of the Company are involved in other business activities and may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities. If a specific business opportunity becomes available, such persons may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and their other business interests. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008 stock subscriptions receivable of $20,000 were due from Directors for 4,000,000 shares issued. NOTE 7. GOING CONCERN The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has net losses for the period from inception (July 1, 2008) to April 30, 2010 of $2,112. This condition raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The Companys continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management is planning to raise additional funds through debt or equity offerings. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts. NOTE 8. LOANS PAYABLE RELATED PARTY In 2008 and 2009, the Company's Director advanced a total of $2,818. The advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on demand. NOTE 9. ADVERTISING COSTS The Companys policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company had not incurred any advertising expense as of April 30, 2010 F-10 NOTE 10. CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS The Company's operations are subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, technological, and regulatory risks including the potential risk of business failure. See Note 7 regarding going concern matters. NOTE 11. PROPERTY The Company does not own or rent any property. We currently maintain our corporate office at 85- 5348 Vegas Dr., Las Vegas, NV 89108 USA. This location is a virtual office that we maintain for $45 per month pursuant to a lease with INC Management, a company affiliated with EastBiz.com, Inc., which provides us with a mailing address for communications, a contact phone number as well as secretarial and administrative services should we need it. We may terminate the lease arrangement upon 30-days' written notice to INC Management. Our executive officers, Mr. David and Mr. Benita, do not work from this location, but operate from their respective residences in Israel at no charge to us. F-11 Until ________, 2010 [90 days from date of prospectus], all dealers effecting transactions in these securities, whether or not participating in this Offering, may be required to deliver a prospectus.

Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution The following table sets forth the expenses in connection with the issuance and distribution of the securities being registered hereby. All such expenses will be borne by the registrant. Name of Expense Amount Securities and Exchange Commission registration fee $ 4.28 Legal, accounting fees and expenses (1) $ 12,000 Edgar filing, printing and engraving fees (1) $ 795.72 Total $ 12,800 (1) Estimated. ITEM 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers Our officers and directors are indemnified as provided by the Nevada Revised Statutes and by our Bylaws. Under the Nevada Revised Statutes, director immunity from liability to a company or its stockholders for monetary liabilities applies automatically unless it is specifically limited by a companys Articles of Incorporation. Our Articles of Incorporation do not specifically limit our directors immunity. Excepted from that immunity are: (a) a wilful failure to deal fairly with the company or its stockholders in connection with a matter in which the director has a material conflict of interest; (b) a violation of criminal law, unless the director had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was lawful or no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful; (c) a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal profit; and (d) wilful misconduct. Our Bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by Nevada law; provided, however, that we may modify the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with our directors and officers; and, provided, further, that we shall not be required to indemnify any director or officer in connection with any proceeding, or part thereof, initiated by such person unless such indemnification: (a) is expressly required to be made by law, (b) the proceeding was authorized by our Board of Directors, (c) is provided by us, in our sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in us under Nevada law or (d) is required to be made pursuant to the Bylaws. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and control persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, we have been advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy, and is, therefore, unenforceable. II-1 ITEM 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On July 1, 2008, we issued 2,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock to Mordechay David, our President and Director, for a purchase price of $0.005 per share, or for aggregate proceeds of $10,000. On July 1, 2008, we issued 2,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock to Shamir Benita, our Treasurer, Secretary and Director, for a purchase price of $0.005 per share, or for aggregate proceeds of $10,000. We believe that the issuances of the securities set forth above were exempt from registration as offerings completed under Regulation S of the Securities Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We believed that this exemption from registration was available for each transaction because each purchaser represented to us, among other things, that he was a non-U.S. person as defined in Regulation S, was not acquiring the shares for the account or benefit of, directly or indirectly, any U.S. person, he had the intention to acquire the securities for investment purposes only and not with a view to or for sales in connection with any distribution thereof, and that he was sophisticated and was able to bear the risk of loss of his entire investment. Further, appropriate legends were affixed to the certificates for the securities issued in such transactions and we did not otherwise engage in distribution of these shares in the U.S. ITEM 16. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules (a) Exhibits: The following exhibits are filed as part of this registration statement: Exhibit Description 3.1 Articles of Incorporation of Registrant. 3.2 Bylaws of Registrant. 4.1 Specimen Common Stock Certificate. 5.1 Legal Opinion of Macdonald Tuskey. 23.1 Consent of Weinberg & Baer LLC 23.2 Consent of Macdonald Tuskey (incorporated in Exhibit 5.1). 99.1 Form of Subscription Agreement to be entered into in connection with this offering. II-2 Undertakings The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act); (ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of this registration statement (or the most-recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; (iii) to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement. (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
