THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS NOT COMPLETE AND DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. MAVEN MEDIA HOLDINGS, INC. Maven Media Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 11, 2008. We were formed to enter into the royalty-free stock image online sales industry. The company intends to create an affiliate-based website, branded "MavenStock.com" where the company's visual media content is available for viewing, purchasing and downloading. The company plans to solicit its photographic originals from photographers and content developers and create an inventory of stock images available for visual content users. The website will include still photographic images, illustrations, clip art and video clips. Maven Media plans to create an inventory of royalty-free stock images from established content providers where they will maintain ownership of their images and content. (Royalty-free stock content (photography, video, illustration and sound loops) is content that can be acquired through a "one-time license" fee, which gives the purchaser the right to use according to the terms of the license.) The Company will generate revenue by charging content purchasers a licensing fee on the images and content they purchase through our website. Maven Media's online transaction services will compete with traditional stock image agencies, by providing photographers, illustrators, graphic designers, animators, and cinematographers and other visual artists a low cost, online venue to sell their work to users of stock photographic images. We are a development stage company and have no operating history or generated any revenues. Our limited start-up operations have consisted of the formation of our business plan and identification of our target market. We will require the funds from this offering in order to fully implement our business plan as discussed in the "Plan of Operation" section of this prospectus. We received our initial funding of $10,000 through the sale of common stock to our officer and director, Adrienne Humphreys, who purchased 2,000,000 shares of our common stock at $.005 per share on March 31, 2008. From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operations. Our financial statement from inception (March 11, 2008) through the year ended March 31, 2008 report no revenues and a net loss of $-0-. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for Maven Media Holdings, Inc. which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our principal executive office is located at the premises of our President, Adrienne Humphreys, which she provides to us on a rent free basis at 1649 Dartmouth Street, Chula Vista, CA 91913. We plan to use these offices until we require larger space. THE OFFERING Following is a brief summary of this offering. Please see "Plan of Distribution" for a more detailed description of the terms of the offering. The Issuer: Maven Media Holdings, Inc. Securities Being Offered: 1,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 Price Per Share: $0.03 Duration of Offering: The shares are offered for a period not to exceed 180 days, unless extended by our Board of Directors for an additional 90 days. In the event 3 we do not sell all of the shares before the expiration date of the offering, all funds raised will be promptly returned to the investors, without interest or deduction. Net Proceeds to the Company: $30,000 Securities Issued and Outstanding: 2,000,000 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus. Registration Costs: We estimate our total offering registration costs to be $4,500. Risk Factors: See "Risk Factors" and the other information in this prospectus for a discussion of the factors you should consider before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock, when and if we trade at a later date, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. RISKS ASSOCIATED TO OUR BUSINESS WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE NO OPERATING HISTORY OR GENERATED ANY REVENUES. AN INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OFFERED HEREIN IS HIGHLY RISKY AND COULD RESULT IN A COMPLETE LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN OUR BUSINESS PLAN. Maven Media Holdings, Inc. was incorporated March 11, 2008 and we have not yet commenced our business operations, and we have not yet realized any revenues. We have no operating history upon which an evaluation of our future prospects can be made. Based upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods as we incur expenses associated with the initial startup of our business. Further, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in realizing revenues or in achieving or sustaining positive cash flow at any time in the future. Any such failure could result in the possible closure of our business or force us to seek additional capital through loans or additional sales of our equity securities to continue business operations, which would dilute the value of any shares you purchase in this offering. ADRIENNE HUMPHREYS, OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY, CURRENTLY DEVOTES APPROXIMATELY 10 HOURS PER WEEK TO COMPANY MATTERS. SHE IS INVOLVED IN OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITIES WHICH COULD RESULT IN A POSSIBLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST. THE COMPANY'S NEEDS COULD EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF TIME OR LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE SHE MAY HAVE. THIS COULD RESULT IN HER INABILITY TO PROPERLY MANAGE COMPANY AFFAIRS, RESULTING IN OUR REMAINING A START-UP COMPANY WITH NO REVENUES OR PROFITS. Our business plan does not provide for the hiring of any additional employees until sales will support the expense. Until that time the responsibility of developing the company's business, the offering and selling of the shares through their prospectus and fulfilling the reporting requirements of a public company all fall upon Adrienne Humphreys. We have not formulated a plan to resolve any possible conflict of interest with her other business activities. In the event she is unable to fulfill any aspect of her duties to the company we may experience a shortfall or complete lack of sales resulting in little or no profits and eventual closure of the business. 4 WE DO NOT YET HAVE ANY SUBSTANTIAL ASSETS AND ARE TOTALLY DEPENDENT UPON THE PROCEEDS OF THIS OFFERING TO INITIALLY FUND OUR BUSINESS. IF WE DO NOT SELL ALL OF THE SHARES IN THIS OFFERING AND RECEIVE ALL OF THE PROCEEDS, WE WILL HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE FINANCING TO COMPLETE OUR BUSINESS PLANS OR ABANDON THEM. The only cash currently available is the cash paid by our founder for the acquisition of her shares. In the event we do not sell all of the shares and raise the total offering proceeds, there can be no assurance that we would be able to raise the additional funding needed to implement our business plans or that unanticipated costs will not increase our projected expenses for the year following completion of this offering. Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHEN OR IF WE WILL PRODUCE REVENUES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A TOTAL LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN OUR BUSINESS PLANS. We have not yet implemented our website or produced our proprietary online digital image software to create our database. Therefore, we have not yet generated any revenues from operations. In order for us to continue with our plans and open our business, we must raise our initial capital to do so through this offering. The timing of the completion of the milestones needed to commence operations and generate revenues is contingent on the success of this offering. There can be no assurance that we will generate revenues or that revenues will be sufficient to maintain our business. As a result, you could lose all of your investment if you decide to purchase shares in this offering and we are not successful in our proposed business plans. OUR CONTINUED OPERATIONS DEPEND ON THE DIGITAL CONTENT PROVIDERS AND DEVELOPERS' ACCEPTANCE OF OUR DIGITAL CONTENT POLICY. IF THEY DO NOT CONTRIBUTE ROYALTY-FREE MEDIA CONTENT, WE CANNOT ESTABLISH A CUSTOMER BASE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE ANY REVENUES, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A FAILURE OF OUR BUSINESS AND A LOSS OF ANY INVESTMENT YOU MAKE IN OUR SHARES The ability to develop an inventory of royalty-free stock images and media content as well as locating customers willing to purchase our visual content is critically important to our success. (Royalty-free stock content (photography, video, illustration and sound loops) is content that can be acquired through a "one-time license" fee, which gives the purchaser the right to use according to the terms of the license.) We cannot be certain that a demand for our content media will ever develop and we may never realize any revenues. In addition, there are no assurances that if we make alterations to services we provide, our company will be successful in increasing sales and this could adversely affect our business and any possible revenues. THE LOSS OF ADRIENNE HUMPHREYS COULD SEVERELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SERVICES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF REVENUES AND YOUR ABILITY TO EVER SELL ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING. Our performance is substantially dependent upon the professional expertise of our President, Adrienne Humphreys. Ms. Humphreys has extensive contacts and experience in the digital media industry and we are dependent on her ability to develop and market our services. If she were unable to perform her services, this loss could have an adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and operating results if we are unable to replace her with another individual qualified to develop and market our digital services. The loss of her services could result in a loss of revenues, which could result in a reduction of the value of any shares you purchase in this offering. THE ROYALTY-FREE STOCK PHOTOGRAPHIC CONTENT INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. IF WE CAN NOT DEVELOP AND MARKET CONTENT IMAGES THAT THE CREATIVE PROFESSIONAL IS WILLING TO PURCHASE, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO GENERATE ANY REVENUES. 5 The royalty-free stock photographic content industry is intensely competitive. We will compete against a number of larger well-established companies with greater name recognition, a more comprehensive offering of services, and with substantially larger resources than ours; including financial and marketing. In addition to these large competitors there are numerous smaller operations that have developed and are marketing digital stock content. Our competitors include, by way of example, gettyimages.com, istockphoto.com and veer.com. If we cannot successfully compete in this highly competitive industry, we may never be able to generate revenues or become profitable. As a result, you may never be able to liquidate or sell any shares you purchase in this offering. THERE ARE NO SUBSTANTIAL BARRIERS OF ENTRY INTO THE ROYALTY-FREE STOCK PHOTOGRAPHIC CONTENT INDUSTRY AND BECAUSE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY PATENT OR TRADEMARK PROTECTION FOR OUR PROPOSED SERVICES, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE SOMEONE ELSE WILL NOT DUPLICATE OUR IDEAS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET BEFORE WE DO, WHICH COULD SEVERELY LIMIT OUR PROPOSED SALES AND REVENUES. We believe our stock photographic content services are unique and desirable; however, we currently have no patents or trademarks for our services or brand name. As business operations become established, we may seek such protection; however, we currently have no plans to do so. Since we have no patent or trademark rights unauthorized persons may attempt to copy aspects of our business, including our web site design or functionality, end user license agreement or marketing materials. Any encroachment upon our corporate information, including the unauthorized use of our brand name, the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated against us for infringement upon another company's proprietary information or improper use of their trademark, may affect our ability to create brand name recognition, cause customer confusion and/or have a detrimental effect on our business. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. or International Patent and Trademark Offices may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and domain name and/or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement, litigation or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business operations and/or results of operations. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING THE TRADING IN OUR SHARES WILL BE REGULATED BY SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULE 15G-9 WHICH ESTABLISHED THE DEFINITION OF A "PENNY STOCK." THE EFFECTIVE RESULT BEING FEWER PURCHASERS QUALIFIED BY THEIR BROKERS TO PURCHASE OUR SHARES, AND THEREFORE A LESS LIQUID MARKET FOR OUR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES. The shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and rules of the Commission. The exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to person other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker-dealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement prior to the sale. In addition, the broker-dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES, UNLESS WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN SELLING ALL OF THE SHARES AND RECEIVING ALL OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS OFFERING, WE MAY HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE FINANCING TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLANS AND YOU WOULD RECEIVE A RETURN OF YOUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. 6 This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to sell them through our officer and director, who will receive no commissions. She will offer the shares to friends, relatives, acquaintances and business associates, however, there is no guarantee that she will be able to sell any of the shares. In the event we do not sell all of the shares before the expiration date of the offering, all funds raised will be promptly returned to the investors, without interest or deduction. DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING. There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the effectiveness of this Registration Statement and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board (OTCBB). The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter (OTC) securities. The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements per se, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. Market Makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 or 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings between Maven Media or anyone acting on our behalf with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment. YOU WILL INCUR IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION OF THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR YOUR SHARES. Our existing stockholder acquired her shares at a cost of $.005 per share, a cost per share substantially less than that which you will pay for the shares you purchase in this offering. Accordingly, any investment you make in these shares will result in the immediate and substantial dilution of the net tangible book value of those shares from the $.03 you pay for them. Upon completion of the offering, the net tangible book value of your shares will be $.013 per share, $.017 less than what you paid for them. WE WILL BE HOLDING ALL PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING IN A STANDARD BANK ACCOUNT UNTIL ALL SHARES ARE SOLD HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE ALL OF THE FUNDS WILL BE USED AS OUTLINED IN THIS PROSPECTUS. All funds received from the sale of shares in this offering will be deposited into a standard bank account until all shares are sold and the offering is closed, at which time, the proceeds will be transferred to our business operating account. We have committed to use the proceeds raised in this offering for the uses set forth in the proceeds table. However, certain factors beyond our control, such as increases in certain costs, could result in the company being forced to reduce the proceeds allocated for other uses in order to accommodate these unforeseen changes. The failure of our management to use these funds effectively could result in unfavorable returns. This could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. OUR DIRECTOR WILL CONTINUE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT CONTROL OVER OUR OPERATIONS, WHICH MEANS AS A MINORITY SHAREHOLDER, YOU WOULD HAVE NO CONTROL OVER CERTAIN MATTERS REQUIRING STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL THAT COULD AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO EVER RESELL ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING. 7 After the completion of this offering, our executive officer and director will own 60% of our common stock. Due to the controlling amount of her share ownership, she will have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions, including the election of directors, approval of significant corporate transactions, changes in control of the company or other matters that could affect your ability to ever resell your shares. Her interests may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders. WE WILL INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE. WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL. Our business plan allows for the estimated $4,500 cost of this Registration Statement to be paid from our cash on hand. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the effectiveness of this Registration Statement and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. Market Makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 or 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. USE OF PROCEEDS Assuming sale of all of the shares offered herein, of which there is no assurance, the net proceeds from this offering will be $30,000. The proceeds are expected to be disbursed, in the priority set forth below, during the first twelve (12) months after the successful completion of the offering: Planned Expenditures Over Category The Next 12 Months -------- ------------------ Website Design and Branding $ 4,000 Development of applications and database $10,500 Legal and Accounting $ 4,500 Administrative Expenses $ 1,800 Marketing $ 9,200 TOTAL PROCEEDS TO COMPANY $30,000 We will establish a separate bank account and all proceeds will be deposited into that account until the total amount of the offering is received and all shares are sold, at which time the funds will be released to us for use in our operations. In the event we do not sell all of the shares before the expiration date of the offering, all funds will be returned promptly to the subscribers, without interest or deduction. If necessary, Ms. Humphreys, our director, has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process but we will require full funding to implement our complete business plan. 8 DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The offering price of the share has been determined arbitrarily by us. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plans. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities. DILUTION Dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing shareholders. As of March 31, 2008, the net tangible book value of our shares was $10,000 or $.005 per share, based upon 2,000,000 shares outstanding. Upon completion of this offering, but without taking into account any change in the net tangible book value after completion of this offering other than that resulting from the sale of the shares and receipt of the total proceeds of $30,000, the net tangible book value of the 3,000,000 shares to be outstanding will be $40,000, or approximately $.013 per share. Accordingly, the net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholder (2,000,000) will be increased by $.008 per share without any additional investment on his part. The purchasers of shares in this offering will incur immediate dilution (a reduction in the net tangible book value per share from the offering price of $.03 (per share) or $.017 per share. As a result, after completion of the offering, the net tangible book value of the shares held by purchasers in this offering would be $.013 per share, reflecting an immediate reduction in the $.03 price per share he paid for their shares. After completion of the offering, the existing shareholder will own 66.7% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which she will have made an investment of $10,000 or $.005 per share. Upon completion of the offering, the purchasers of these shares offered hereby will own 33.3% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which they will have made a cash investment of $30,000, or $.03 per share. The following table illustrates the per share dilution to the new investors: Public Offering Price Per Share $.03 Net Tangible Book Value Prior to this Offering $.005 Net Tangible Book Value After Offering $.013 Immediate Dilution per Share to New Investors $.017 The following table summarizes the number and percentages of shares purchased, the amount and percentage of consideration paid and the average price per share paid by our existing stockholder and by new investors in this offering: Price Per Total Number of Percent of Consideration Share Shares Held Ownership Paid ----- ----------- --------- ---- Existing Shareholder $.005 2,000,000 66.7% $10,000 Investors in this Offering $.03 1,000,000 33.3% $30,000 9 PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION OFFERING WILL BE SOLD BY OUR OFFICER AND/OR DIRECTOR This is a self-underwritten offering. This prospectus permits our officer and/or director to sell the shares directly to the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to her for any shares she may sell. There are no plans or arrangement to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the shares with a broker or dealer. Our officer and/or director, Ms. Adrienne Humphreys, will sell the shares and intends to offer them to friends, family members and business acquaintances. In offering the securities on our behalf, she will rely on the safe harbor from broker dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our officer and/or director will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in reliance upon Rule 3a4-1, which sets forth those conditions under which a person associated with an Issuer may participate in the offering of the Issuer's securities and not be deemed to be a broker-dealer. a. Our officer and/or director is not subject to a statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Act, at the time of their participation; and, b. Our officer and/or director will not be compensated in connection with her participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transaction in securities; and c. Our officer and/or director is not, nor will she be at the time of her participation in the offering, an associated person of a broker-dealer; and d. Our officer and/or director meets the conditions of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Rule 3a4-1 of the Exchange Act, in that she (A) primarily performs or is intended primarily to perform at the end of the offering, substantial duties for or on behalf of our company, other than in connection with transactions in securities; and (B) is not a broker or dealer, or been an associated person of a broker or dealer, within the preceding twelve months; and (C) has not participated in selling and offering securities for any Issuer more than once every twelve months other than in reliance on Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (a) (4)(iii). Our officer and/or director, control persons and affiliates of same do not intend to purchase any shares in this offering. TERMS OF THE OFFERING The shares will be sold at the fixed price of $.03 per share until the completion of this offering. There is no minimum amount of subscription required per investor, and subscriptions, once received, are irrevocable. This offering will commence on the date of this prospectus and will continue for a period of 180 days (the "Expiration Date"), unless extended by our Board of Directors for an additional 90 days. DEPOSIT OF OFFERING PROCEEDS This is a "best efforts", "all or none" offering and, as such, we will not be able to spend any of the proceeds unless all the shares are sold and all proceeds are received. We intend to hold all funds collected from subscriptions in a separate bank account until the total amount of $30,000 has been received. At that time, the funds will be transferred to our business operating account for use in implementation of our business plan. In the event the offering is not sold out prior to the Expiration Date, all money will be promptly returned to the investors, without interest or deduction.

Subscriptions, once received by the company, are irrevocable. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS NO PUBLIC MARKET FOR COMMON STOCK There is currently no public market for our common stock. There has been no public trading of our securities, and, therefore, no high and low bid pricing. As of the date of this prospectus, Maven Media Holdings, Inc. has one shareholder of record. We have paid no cash dividends and have no outstanding options. We have no securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans. The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or quotation system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; b) contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of Securities' laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (d) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and (f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type, size and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation. The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with: (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a suitably written statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock if it becomes subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, if our common stock becomes subject to the penny stock rules, stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities. REGULATION M Our officer and/or director, who will sell the shares, is aware that she is required to comply with the provisions of Regulation M, promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. With certain exceptions, Regulation M precludes the officer and/or director, sales agent, any broker-dealer or other person who participate in the distribution of shares in this offering from bidding for or purchasing, or attempting to induce any person 11 to bid for or purchase any security which is the subject of the distribution until the entire distribution is complete. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION PLAN OF OPERATION Our cash balance is $10,500 as of March 31, 2008. We believe our cash balance is sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations until July, 2008. If we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from our director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees, however, she has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to achieve our business plan goals, we will need the funding from this offering. We are a development stage company and have generated no revenue to date. We have sold $10,000 in equity securities to pay for our minimum level of operations. The following table provides selected financial data about our company for the period from the date of incorporation through March 31, 2008. For detailed financial information, see the financial statements included in this prospectus. Balance Sheet Data: March 31, 2008 ------------------- -------------- Cash $10,500 Total Assets $10,500 Total Liabilities $ 500 Shareholders' Equity $10,000 GOING CONCERN: Our auditor has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we begin our website and start selling visual content images. PROPOSED MILESTONES TO IMPLEMENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS The following milestones are estimates only. The working capital requirements and the projected milestones are approximations only and subject to adjustment based on costs and needs. Our 12 month budget is based on minimum operations which will be completely funded by the $30,000 raised through this offering. If we begin to generate profits we will increase our sales activity accordingly. We estimate sales of royalty-free photographic content to visual media content users to begin in 12 months. Because our business is client-driven, our revenue requirements will be reviewed and adjusted based on sales. The costs associated with operating as a public company are included in our budget. Management will be responsible for the preparation of the required documents to keep the costs to a minimum. We plan to complete our milestones as follows: APRIL - JUNE, 2008 Management will concentrate on the completion of the Registration Statement and utilize this time to also begin putting together a database of potential clients. We will hire a website designer to develop a preliminary website at www.MavenStock.com that we will be able to provide a brief summary of our company and supply potential clients with basic company information.

(Cost Estimate - $3,050) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Company reports revenues and expenses using the accrual method of accounting for financial and tax reporting purposes. The company has elected March 31, year-end. BASIS EARNINGS PER SHARE In February 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share", which specified the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common stock. SFAS No. 128 supersedes the provisions of APG No. 15, and requires the presentation of basic earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share. The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 128 effective March 11, 2008 (inception). Basic net loss per share amounts is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are the same as basic earnings per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company. CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 13 contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In accordance with FASB 16 all adjustments are normal and recurring. INCOME TAXES The company provides for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected t reverse. SFAS No. 109 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 151, Inventory Costs - an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. This Statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory Pricing," to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Paragraph 5 of ARB 43, Chapter 4, previously stated that "under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges." This Statement requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal." In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of this Statement will be effective for the Company beginning with its fiscal year ending August 31, 2007. Management believes that the adoption of this Statement will not have any immediate material impact on the Company. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 152, "Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions--an amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67" ("SFAS 152) The amendments made by Statement 152 This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, to reference the financial accounting and reporting guidance for real estate time-sharing transactions that is provided in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 04-2, Accounting No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, to state that the guidance for (a) incidental operations and (b) costs incurred to sell real estate projects does not apply to real estate time-sharing transactions. The accounting for those operations and costs is subject to the guidance in SOP 04-2. This Statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, with earlier application encouraged. The Company believes that the implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004) "Share-Based Payment". This Statement requires that the cost resulting from all share-based transactions be recorded in the financial statements. The Statement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based measurement in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees. The Statement also establishes fair value as the measurement objective for transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services from non-employees in share-based payment transactions. The Statement replaces SFAS 13 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees". The provisions of this Statement will be effective for the Company beginning with its fiscal year ending August 31, 2007. The Company believes that the implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 14 In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) which provides guidance regarding the interaction of SFAS 123 (R) and certain SEC rules and regulations. The new guidance includes the SEC's view on the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies and may simplify some of SFAS 123 (R)`s implementation challenges for registrants and enhance the information investors receive. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which clarifies that the term `conditional asset retirement obligation' as used in SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that FIN 47 will have a material impact on its financial position or results from operations. In August 2005, the FASB issued SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. This statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement if the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions, and it changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting them. Unless it is impractical, the statement requires retrospective application of the changes to prior periods' financial statements. This statement is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2005. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS COMPANY HISTORY Maven Media Holdings, Inc. is a development stage company, incorporated on March 11, 2008 in the State of Delaware to enter into the royalty-free stock image online sales industry. (Royalty-free stock content (photography, video, illustration and sound loops) is content that can be acquired through a "one-time license" fee, which gives the purchaser the right to use according to the terms of the license.) The company intends to create an affiliate-based website, branded "MavenStock.com" where the company's visual media content is available for viewing, purchasing and downloading. The company plans to solicit its photographic originals from photographers and content developers and create an inventory of stock images available for visual content users. The website will include still photographic images, illustrations, clip art and video clips. To date, the company's operations have been limited to researching our e-commerce business model and software systems. We have not yet implemented our business plan or developed our subscription-based website. To date, we have generated no revenues from our operations. Adrienne Humphreys serves as officer and director of our company from inception (March 11, 2008) to current date. No other person other than Ms. Humphreys has acted as a promoter of Maven Media Holdings, Inc. since our inception. Other than Ms. Humphrey's purchase of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock on March 31, 2008, Ms. Humphreys has not entered into any agreement with us in which she is to receive from us or provide to us anything of value. Ms. Humphreys purchased the 2,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $.005 per share for a total of $10,000. 15 Maven Media has provided the following information concerning the company and its business for inclusion in this offering.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND The visual content industry supplies images to a varied and growing customer base, ranging from individual consumers to major multi-national corporations. Images are used to communicate messages in a wide variety of applications including print, electronic and broadcast advertising, direct mail and marketing brochures, educational and training publications, books, magazines, newspapers, corporate communications and annual reports, motion pictures, broadcasting, CD-ROM products, sties on the World Wide Web (the "Web" or the "Internet"), other on-line uses, sales and in-house presentations and various consumer uses. The visual content industry has grown substantially in recent years. According to Jon Peddie Research (April, 2007), digital content creation, including the market for stock digital photographic images, grew 16% from $2.6 billion to reach more than $3 billion in 2006 and expected to grow to $4.3 billion by 2012. Getty Images, the largest stock visual content agency in North America, had annual sales in 2007 of $857 million. Corbis, founded in 1989 and wholly owned by Microsoft Chairman, Bill Gates, offers more than 100 million creative images owning collections including the Bettman archive (17 million images) and Sygma, the European Press Agency, 40 million images). Corbis currently has annual revenues of $251 million. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION MavenStock.com will feature an independent collection of royalty-free images and digital content available for purchase and immediate download for use in the development of creative production services and other end use applications. The content to be available for purchase through the company's website, will include photographs, video and vector illustrations. Maven Media will focus on developing an online stock image transaction service. It is similar to other online stock image agency websites in that it will have the capabilities for corporations and other online usage buyers to purchase image usage rights online and to take digital delivery of the image electronically. We will offer a "Content Contribution Agreement" which will allow the photographer/content contributor to retain full control and rights of their photographs or digital content produced while extending MavenStock.com the right to indefinitely market, feature and resale the content on the company's website. Maven Media plans to compensate all contributing photographers and content developers with fees from purchased images/content from MavenStock.com. In addition to soliciting images from independent photographers and content developers, MavenStock.com plans to produce content and special collections for sale and would retain full exclusive rights from all content produced in-house. 16 FEATURE AND FUNCTIONALITY FOR MAVENSTOCK.COM Maven Media's website will be an online marketplace that supports a community of buyers and sellers of affordable royalty-free stock photography and digital content.

Some of the information that may be available will include size and resolution of original image downloaded, date and amount of image purchased along with a link to the creator's portfolio. The RECEIPT PANEL will allow users to view all past purchase receipts. A sort filter will allow the users to isolate receipts quickly from a certain time period or project ID assigned to the original purchase. This will provide a useful tool to creative professionals alike when it comes to tracking expenses associated with design development and production. The UPLOAD PANEL provides any member the ability to upload content quickly and efficiently to MavenStock.com. The photographer will be able to upload batch files using a web-browser based ftp utility. Once the images are uploaded and stored in the photographer's image queue, they will need to catalog the image(s) with detailed keywords. The more detailed the keywords used in the description of the image, the better the search results. During the cataloging phase the photographer will need to attach any model and/or property release agreements associated with the image. Once an image has been uploaded and cataloged correctly, the image will need to be submitted to our review department. During the submittal process the photographer will need to agree to MavenStock.com's site agreement. When an image is approved by MavenStock.com, an automated message will be sent to the contributor, informing them the image is now available for purchase on the website. If an image is declined an automated message will inform the contributor why the image was not accepted. MavenStock.com will always have the right to refuse or deny any content that we feel is unsuitable or inappropriate. Not all images uploaded will be guaranteed to be added to the website. We will attempt to explain why the image is being rejected and suggest how to correct the image for possible re-submittal. This will be achieved by a set of predefined remarks and parameters that the reviewer can select before declining an image. Those remarks will be passed along within the automated rejection message. The contributor will have the opportunity to make any suggested edits and then resubmit the image at their discretion. The EARNINGS PANEL will allow members to review detailed earnings information regarding their content available on MavenStock.com. The photographer will be able to see at a glance what their total earnings are since joining MavenStock.com and current balance due from purchased images. At the end of every month, an account summary will be sent via email to all content contributing members notifying them of the current balance-due. The content contributor can request payment at anytime by selecting the "request payment" button in the control panel interface. To keep processing fees to a minimum, we will require a minimum account balance of $100 or more before payment disbursement. If funds are totaling less than $100, they can request funds but may be subject to a processing fee. SUPPORT AND FAQ The support and FAQ section of MavenStock.com will provide contact information for technical and general business inquiries. We plan to have test users and 20 focus groups provide us with general questions they have about the site. We plan to feature these questions on our site in a "Frequently Asked Questions" section. REVENUE MODEL MavenStock.com is a royalty-free image transactional website, where it sells visual content to various industries. The company shares the revenue with contributing photographers or content producers at various rates. The following is a categorized revenue model for MavenStock.com: CONTRIBUTING PHOTOGRAPHER AND CONTENT DEVELOPER: The contributing photographer and content developer will receive a royalty for each image that sells on the MavenStock.com website. When the contributing member reaches a minimum balance they will be able to request payment through their account management tool on the website. There are no annual or hidden fees for members. The estimated royalty rate paid to a contributing photographer or content developer will range based on the amount of content they have contributed to the MavenStock.com website. There are no minimum upload requirements when signing up as a contributing member on MavenStock.com. However, the more images a photographer has posted on Mavenstock.com, the better the chance of realizing a sale and benefiting from joining MavenStock.com. The following is the company's estimated royalty rates that will be offered to contributing members. Royalty Rates for Contributing Members (Rates and requirements subject to change.)

MAVENSTOCK.COM OWNED IMAGES: To build additional value for the company, MavenStock.com will be producing and developing their own visual content available for sale on the company's website. Content created by the company and/or under contract for MavenStock.com, resulting in the company retaining 100% of the sale price when the image is purchased. This will also build an inherent value because these images will only be available exclusively at MavenStock.com. These collections can later be contracted out to other stock photography websites and collections. 21 VISUAL CONTENT PURCHASES: When an image is purchased from the MavenStock.com website and downloaded from the server, an ecommerce transaction is produced and completed.

Internet marketing can be very cost effective in branding a product to a very large audience. These techniques include non-spam direct email initiatives, registration with well-established industry-wide search engines and reciprocal marketing arrangements with similar websites. Maven Media plans to promote the awareness of its MavenStock.com's website through a marketing plan for photographers, content developers and visual content users that will consists of the following components: - Internet Search Placement & Registration - Direct Mail - Banner Advertising - Email Advertising - Professional Associations & Sponsorships 22 INTERNET SEARCH PLACEMENT & REGISTRATION MavenStock.com plans to advertise and register with all major search engines including Google and Yahoo. We will attempt to purchase top placement for search results related to "royalty-free stock images". In addition we will tag our website with related keywords so we will appear predominately in standard searches as well. FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS AND CONTENT DEVELOPERS: DIRECT MAIL Our plan is to create a monthly direct mail marketing campaign targeted toward photographers and content developers, where we mail out a monthly oversized postcard with a branded message that we anticipate will attract photographers to the site, which in turn could lead to submission of images to our database. BANNER ADVERTISING We plan to identify, design and place several banner ads on popular photographic and other industry related websites advertising our "Call for Entries". The banner ad will allow users to click-through to a specific landing page on our website. EMAIL ADVERTISING We plan to produce an email newsletter that will be sent to registered members of MavenStock.com. In addition, we plan to purchase several lists of email addresses from industry related publications and specialty website (non-spam). Recipients of these emails can opt out at anytime by selecting the appropriate link in the body of the email. PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS & SPONSORSHIPS We plan to work at establishing relationships with several professional photography associations and market our services to their members. We will create special incentives to entice their members to join our contributor program. We may also sponsor certain events and functions with these alliance associations to further our brand awareness. FOR VISUAL CONTENT USERS: DIRECT MAIL Our plan is to create a quarterly direct mail marketing campaign targeted toward visual content purchasers (art directors, graphic designers). We plan to mail out a quarterly pocket size calendar and postcard with a branded message that we anticipate will attract visual content customers to the site, which in turn could lead to the purchase of images contained in our database. BANNER ADVERTISING Our company plans to identify and place several banner ads on popular creative resource websites, advertising our collection of affordable "Royalty Free Images". The banner ad will allow users to click-through to a specific landing page on our website to begin their image or content search. 23 PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS & SPONSORSHIPS We plan to work at establishing relationships with several professional creative and design associations and market our services to their members. We may also sponsor certain events and functions with these alliance associations to further our brand awareness. DISTRIBUTION METHODS Maven Media plans to market to photographers and visual content developers (illustrators, graphic designers, animators and cinematographers and other visual artists) to seek inventory for sales to visual content users (advertising companies, art directors and graphic designers). STATUS OF ANY PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED NEW PRODUCTS We have not publicly announced any new products. COMPETITION We expect to face significant competition in the stock content media industry. This would include larger stock content media companies such as Gettyimages.com and istockphoto.com who have greater financial, marketing and other resources, as well as more experience in the stock content media industry. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively and because we have not yet begun operations we do not have a competitive position relative to these other companies. Our competitors include gettyimages.com, istockphoto.com and snapvillage.com. Our operations and our ability to generate revenues will be harmed if we are unable to establish a reputation as a provider of quality royalty-free stock content. SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS The Company has identified numerous photographers, illustrators, graphic designers, animators, cinematographers and other visual artists who will be contacted to supply content for MavenStock images. As discussed in the Description of Business section of this prospectus, we anticipate utilizing many different sources of royalty-free stock content to add to our library of stock media images. DEPENDENCE ON ONE OR A FEW MAJOR CUSTOMERS We feel that because of the potential wide base of customers for our services, we will not rely on one or few major customers. PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks. NEED FOR ANY GOVERNMENT APPROVAL OF PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS We are not required to apply for or have any government approval for our product or service.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT The following table sets forth certain information concerning the number of shares of our common stock owned beneficially as of May 21, 2008 by: (i) each person (including any group) known to us to own more than five percent (5%) of any class of our voting securities, (ii) our director, and or (iii) our officer. Unless otherwise indicated, the stockholder listed possesses sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown. Amount and Nature Percentage of of Beneficial Common Title of Class Name and Address of Beneficial Owner Ownership Stock(1) - -------------- ------------------------------------ --------- -------- Common Stock Adrienne Humphreys, Director 2,000,000 1649 Dartmouth Street Direct 100% Chula Vista, CA 91913 Common Stock Officer and/or director as a Group 2,000,000 100% HOLDERS OF MORE THAN 5% OF OUR COMMON STOCK - ---------- (1) A beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, 27 for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the person's actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on May 21, 2008. As of May 21, 2008, there were 2,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES GENERAL Our authorized capital stock consists of 80,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.0001 per share. As of May 21, 2008, there were 2,000,000 shares of our common stock of our common stock issued and outstanding that was held of record by one (1) registered stockholder. COMMON STOCK The following is a summary of the material rights and restrictions associated with our common stock. This description does not purport to be a complete description of all of the rights of our stockholders and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the provisions of our most current Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, which are included as exhibits to this Registration Statement. The holders of our common stock currently have (i) equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available therefore, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Company; (ii) are entitled to share ratably in all of the assets of the Company available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company (iii) do not have preemptive, subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights applicable thereto; and (iv) are entitled to one non-cumulative vote per share on all matters on which stock holders may vote. All shares of common stock now outstanding are fully paid for and non-assessable and all shares of common stock which are the subject of this offering, when issued, will be fully paid for and non-assessable. Please refer to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws and the applicable statutes of the State of Delaware for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of the Company's securities. NON-CUMULATIVE VOTING The holders of shares of common stock of the Company do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holder of more than 50% of such outstanding shares, voting for the election of director, can elect all of the directors to be elected, if she so chooses, and, in such event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any of the Company's directors. After this Offering is completed, the present stockholder will own 60% of the outstanding shares. (See "Dilution"). DIVIDEND POLICY We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 28 INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES Our Certificate of Incorporation provide that we will indemnify an officer, director, or former officer or director, to the full extent permitted by law. We have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by one of our director, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our legal counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit the question of whether such indemnification is against public policy to a court of appropriate jurisdiction. We will then be governed by the court's decision.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE We have had no changes in or disagreements with our accountants. 30 MOORE & ASSOCIATES, CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS AND ADVISORS PCAOB REGISTERED REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors Maven Media Holdings, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Maven Media Holdings, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) as of March 31, 2008, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the period from inception on March 11, 2008 through March 31, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Maven Media Holdings, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) as of March 31, 2008, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the period from inception on March 11, 2008 through March 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred cumulative net losses of $0.00 since its inception and requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 6. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ Moore & Associates, Chartered - ----------------------------------------- Moore & Associates Chartered Las Vegas, Nevada May 12, 2008 2675 S.

F-5 MAVEN MEDIA HOLDINGS, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS March 31, 2008 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Maven Media Holdings, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated on March 11, 2008 under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company plans to enter into the stock photographic image online sales industry and create an affiliate-based website, branded "Mavenstock.com" where the company's photographic content database is available for viewing, purchasing and downloading. The Company is a development stage enterprise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 7. The Company has been in the development stage since its formation and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations. NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Company reports revenue and expenses using the accrual method of accounting for financial and tax reporting purposes. USE OF ESTIMATES Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND CAPITALIZATION The Company records depreciation and amortization, when appropriate, using both straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (five to seven years). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions, major renewals and replacements that increase the property's useful life are capitalized. Property sold or retired, together with the related accumulated depreciation is removed from the appropriate accounts and the resultant gain or loss is included in net income. INCOME TAXES The company provides for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expectedt reverse. F-6 MAVEN MEDIA HOLDINGS, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS March 31, 2008 SFAS No. 109 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to net loss before provision for income taxes for the following reasons: As of March 31, 2008 -------------------- Income tax expense at statutory rate $ 0 Valuation allowance 0 -------- Income tax expense per books $ 0 ======== FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial accounting Standards Statement No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments", requires the Company to disclose, when reasonably attainable, the fair market values of its assets and liabilities which are deemed to be financial instruments. The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and certain investments. INVESTMENTS Investments that are purchased in other companies are valued at cost less any impairment in the value that is other than temporary in nature. PER SHARE INFORMATION The Company computes per share information in accordance with SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share" which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during such period. F-7 MAVEN MEDIA HOLDINGS, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS March 31, 2008 Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company has basic and diluted loss per share of $0.0001. ADVERTISING AND MARKETING There were no advertising and marketing expenses for the period ended March 31, 2008. NOTE 3 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES LITIGATION The Company is not presently involved in any litigation. NOTE 4 - RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140" to simplify and make more consistent the accounting for certain financial instruments. SFAS No. 155 amends SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", to permit fair value re-measurement for any hybrid financial instrument with an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation, provided that the whole instrument is accounted for on a fair value basis. SFAS NO. 155 amends SFAS NO. 140, "Accounting for the Impairment or disposal of Long-Lived Assets" to allow a qualifying special-purpose entity to hold a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. SFAS No. 155 applies to all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006, with earlier application allowed. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156 "Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement NO. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities". This statement requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities be initially measured at fair value, if practicable, and permits for subsequent measurement using either fair value measurement with changes in fair value reflected in earning or the amortization and impairment requirement of Statement No. 140. The subsequent measurement of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value eliminates the necessity for entities that manage the risks inherent in servicing assets and servicing liabilities with derivatives t qualify for hedge accounting treatment and eliminates the characterization of declines in fair value as impairments or direct write-downs. SFAS No. 156 is effective for an entity's first fiscal year beginning after September 15, 2006. F-8 MAVEN MEDIA HOLDINGS, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS March 31, 2008 These statements are not expected to have a significant effect on the Company's future reported financial position or results of operations. NOTE 5 - GOING CONCERN Future issuances of the Company's equity or debt securities will be required in order for the Company to continue to finance its operations and continue as a going concern. The Company's present revenues are insufficient to meet operating expenses. The financial statements of the Company have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred cumulative net losses of $0.00 since its inception and requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place. The Company's ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company's contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties. NOTE 6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Adrienne Humphreys, the sole officer and director of the Company may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities as they become available, thus she may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and her other business opportunities. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts. Adrienne Humphreys, the sole officer and director of the Company, will not be paid for any underwriting services that she performs on behalf of the Company with respect to the Company's current S-1 offering. She will also not receive any interest on any funds that she advances to the Company for offering expenses prior to the offering being closed which will be repaid from the proceeds of the offering. While the Company is seeking additional capital, Ms. Humphreys has advanced funds to the Company to pay for any costs incurred by it. These funds are interest free. The balance due Ms. Humphreys was $500 on March 31, 2008. NOTE 7 - STOCK TRANSACTIONS Transactions, other than employees' stock issuance, are in accordance with paragraph 8 of SFAS 123. Thus issuances shall be accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received. Transactions with employees' stock issuance are in accordance with paragraphs (16-44) of SFAS 123.
