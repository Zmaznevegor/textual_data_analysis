PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS SUBJECT TO COMPLETION RIVEX TECHNOLOGY CORP. 10,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK This prospectus relates to the offer and sale of a maximum of 10,000,000 shares (the Maximum Offering) of common stock, $0.001 par value (Common Shares) by Rivex Technology Corp., a Nevada corporation (we, us, our, Rivex Technology, Company or similar terms). There is no minimum for this offering. The offering will commence promptly on the date upon which this prospectus is declared effective by the SEC and will continue for 9 months. We will pay all expenses incurred in this offering. We are an emerging growth company under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. The offering of the 10,000,000 shares is a best efforts offering, which means that our officers and sole director will use his best efforts to sell the common stock and there is no commitment by any person to purchase any shares. The shares will be offered at a fixed price of $0.02 per share for the duration of the offering. There is no minimum number of shares required to be sold to close the offering. Proceeds from the sale of the shares will be used to fund the initial stages of our business development. We have not made any arrangements to place funds received from share subscriptions in an escrow, trust or similar account. Any funds raised from the offering will be immediately available to us for our immediate use. This is a direct participation offering since we are offering the stock directly to the public without the participation of an underwriter. Our offices and sole director will be solely responsible for selling shares under this offering and no commission will be paid on any sales. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock and we have not applied for the listing or quotation of our common stock on any public market. We have arbitrarily determined the offering price of $0.02 per share in relation to this offering. The offering price bears no relationship to our assets, book value, earnings or any other customary investment criteria. After the effective date of the registration statement, we intend to seek a market maker to file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to have our common stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and/or OTC Link.

PROSPECTUS SUMMARY As used in this prospectus, references to the Company, we, our, us or Rivex Technology refer to Rivex Technology Corp. unless the context otherwise indicates. The following summary highlights selected information contained in this prospectus. Before making an investment decision, you should read the entire prospectus carefully, including the Risk Factors section, the financial statements, and the notes to the financial statements. Our Company Rivex Technology Corp. was incorporated on September 9, 2014, under the laws of the State of Nevada, to engage in the development and sale of mobile games for the Apple and Android platforms. We are a start-up company that has not realized any revenues to date, and our accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2017 is $1,810. To date we have raised an aggregate of $5,000 through a private placement of our common stock to our officers and sole director. Proceeds from the private placement were used for working capital. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for our Company which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The Companys principal offices are located at Rua da Moeda 19, Evora, Portugal 7000-513. Our telephone number is (702) 846-0808. We plan to raise the additional funding for our twelve-month business plan by selling the 10,000,000 shares in this offering. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell any of the shares being offered to raise sufficient funds to proceed with our twelve-month business plan. From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating activities, primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company, the initial equity funding by our officers and sole director, completing our business plan, and developing our first game. We received our initial funding of $5,000 through the sale of common stock to our officers and sole director. Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov, our officer and sole director, purchased an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $0.001 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $3,000, and Aleksandr Gilev, our secretary, purchased an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $0.001 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $2,000. Our financial statements from inception from inception on September 9, 2014, through March 31, 2017, report no revenues and a net loss of $1,475. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for our Company which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 5 | Page As of the date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our securities will ever develop. We are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. For a description of the qualifications and other requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and certain elections that we have made due to our status as an emerging growth company, see RISK FACTORS RISKS RELATED TO THIS OFFERING AND OUR COMMON STOCK  WE ARE AN `EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN IF THE REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES WILL MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS on page 8 of this prospectus. This is a direct participation offering since we are offering the stock directly to the public without the participation of an underwriter. Our officers and sole director will be solely responsible for selling shares under this offering and no commission will be paid on any sales. There has been no market for our securities and a public market may never develop, or, if any market does develop, it may not be sustained. Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or on the over-the-counter market. After the effective date of the registration statement relating to this prospectus, we hope to have a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for our common stock to be eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board and/or OTC links. We do not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such quotation service or that any market for our stock will develop. You should rely only on the information contained in this prospectus. We have not authorized anyone to provide you with information different from that contained in this prospectus. The information contained in this prospectus is accurate only as of the date of this prospectus, regardless of the time of delivery of this prospectus or of any sale of our common shares. Under U.S. federal securities legislation, our common stock will be penny stock. Penny stock is any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require that a broker or dealer approve a potential investors account for transactions in penny stocks, and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve an investors account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person, and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination. Brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock. Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. 6 | Page THE OFFERING Securities offered: 10,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share. Offering price: $0.02 Duration of offering: The 10,000,000 shares of common stock are being offered for a period of 9 months. Net proceeds to us: $200,000, assuming the maximum number of shares sold.

Market for the common shares: There is no public market for our shares. Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or on the over-the-counter market. After the effective date of the registration statement relating to this prospectus, we hope to have a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for our common stock to eligible for trading on the Over The Counter Bulletin Board and/or OTC Links. We do not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such application. There is no assurance that a trading market will develop, or, if developed, that it will be sustained. Consequently, a purchaser of our common stock may find it difficult to resell the securities offered herein should the purchaser desire to do so when eligible for public resale. Shares outstanding prior to offering: 5,000,000 Shares outstanding after offering: 15,000,000 Risk Factors: The common stock offered hereby involves a high degree of risk and should not be purchased by investors who cannot afford the loss of their entire investment. See Risk Factors beginning on page 8. SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION The tables and information below are derived from our audited financial statements for the period from September 9, 2014 (Inception) to March 31, 2017. Our working capital as of March 31, 2017 was $3,190. March 31, 2017 ($) Financial Summary (Audited) Cash and Deposits 2,100 Total Assets 2,100 Total Liabilities 1,910 Total Stockholders Equity 190 Accumulated From September 9, 2014 (Inception) to March 31, 2017 ($) Statement of Operations Total Expenses 1,475 Net Loss for the Period ( 1,475 ) Net Loss per Share - 7 | Page RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the following known material risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this prospectus in evaluating our company and its business before purchasing shares of our companys common stock. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks. RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY Because our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, there is substantial uncertainty we will continue operations in which case you could lose your investment. In their report dated May 29, 2017, our independent registered public accounting firm, MICHAEL GILLESPIE & ASSOCIATES, PLLC, stated that our financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2017, were prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business. For the period from inception (September 9, 2014) to March 31, 2017, we incurred a net loss of $1,475. We will need to generate significant revenue in order to achieve profitability and we may never become profitable. The going concern paragraph in the independent auditors report emphasizes the uncertainty related to our business as well as the level of risk associated with an investment in our common stock. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations. To implement our plan of operations we require a minimum funding of $100,000 for the next twelve months. We have a limited history of operations and accordingly there is no track record that would provide a basis for assessing our ability to conduct successful commercial activities. We may not be successful in carrying out our business objectives. We were incorporated on September 9, 2014 and to date, have been involved primarily in organizational activities, obtaining financing and developing our first mobile game. Accordingly, we have no track record of successful business activities, strategic decision making by management, fund-raising ability, and other factors that would allow an investor to assess the likelihood that we will be successful as a start-up company which was formed to engage in the development and sale of mobile games for the Apple and Android platforms. As of our year ended March 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,810. Mobile game development companies often fail to achieve or maintain successful operations, even in favorable market conditions. There is a substantial risk that we will not be successful in our development activities, or if initially successful, in thereafter generating any operating revenues or in achieving profitable operations. We depend to a significant extent on certain key personnel, the loss of any of whom may materially and adversely affect our company. Currently, we have only two employees, Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov, who is also the President and Treasurer (principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) and sole director of our company, and Aleksandr Gilev, who is the Secretary of our company. We depend entirely on Mr. Rivera Tchernikov and Mr. Gilev for all of our operations. The loss of Mr. Rivera Tchernikov or Mr. Gilev would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail. Mr. Rivera Tchernikov and Mr. Gilev have not been compensated for their services since our incorporation, and it is highly unlikely that they will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues. There is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. The loss of Mr. Rivera Tchernikov or Mr. Gilevs services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business. In the event of the loss of services of such personnel, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel. We do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officers and sole director. We do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with them or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future. We have limited business, sales and marketing experience in our industry. We have been developing our first mobile game and have yet to generate revenues. While we have plans for marketing our prospective mobile games for the Apple and Android platforms, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. There can be no assurance that our proposed plan to sell mobile games for the Apple and Android platforms will gain wide acceptance in its target market or that we will be able to effectively market our mobile games. Additionally, we are a newly-formed, start-up company with no prior experience in our industry. We are entirely dependent on the services of our President, Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov, and our Secretary, Aleksandr Gilev, to build our customer base. Our company has no prior experience which it can rely upon in order to garner its first prospective customers to play our mobile games. Prospective customers will be less likely to purchase our mobile games than a competitors because we have no prior experience in our industry. We may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors. We expect to face strong competition from well-established companies and small independent companies like our self that may result in price reductions for the mobile games that we plan to sell. We will be at a competitive disadvantage in obtaining the facilities, employees, financing and other resources required to provide mobile game products demanded by prospective customers. Our opportunity to obtain customers may be limited by our financial resources and other assets. We expect to be less able than our larger competitors to cope with generally increasing costs and expenses of doing business. 8 | Page Our business model may not be sufficient to ensure our success in our intended market. Our survival is currently dependent upon the success of our efforts to gain market acceptance of online games that will ultimately represent a very small segment in our targeted industry when it is completed. Should our target market not be as responsive to our games as we anticipate, we may not have in place alternate products or services that we can offer to ensure our survival. While many new products, such as the one we have developed, are regularly introduced, only a relatively small number of mobile games account for a significant portion of net revenue in our industry. Our product may not be a desired for purchase by consumers, or competitors may develop titles that imitate or compete with our mobile games, and take our targeted revenue stream away from us or reduce our ability to command profitable revenue streams for our game. Mobile game products published by our competitors may take a larger share of our target market than we anticipate, which could cause our game revenue streams to fall below our expectations. If our competitors develop more successful products or offer competitive products at lower price, our revenue, margins, and profitability will decline. Since all of our shares of common stock are owned by our officers and sole director, our other stockholders may not be able to influence control of the company or decision making by management of the company, and as such, our officers and sole director may have a conflict of interest with the minority shareholders at some time in the future. Our officers and sole director beneficially own approximately 100% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of our officers and sole director may not be, at all times, the same as that of our other shareholders. Where those conflicts exist, our shareholders will be dependent upon our director exercising, in a manner fair to all of our shareholders, his fiduciary duties as officer or as member of the Companys board of directors. Also, our officers and sole director will have the ability to control the outcome of most corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, including the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and amendments to our Articles of Incorporation. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us, which may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders. Technology change rapidly in our business and if we fail to anticipate or successfully implement new technologies or the manner in which people play our games, the quality, timeliness and competitiveness of our products and services will suffer. Rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market. Therefore, we must start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve. We may not be able to achieve these goals, or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can. In either case, our products and services may be technologically inferior to our competitors, less appealing to consumers, or both. If we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products and services, then we may delay their release until these technology goals can be achieved, which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses. Alternatively, we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies, either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition, which would increase our development expenses. Any such failure to adapt to, and appropriately allocate resources among, emerging technologies would harm our competitive position, reduce our market share and significantly increase the time we take to bring our product to market. If we are unable to complete the promoting and marketing of our mobile games or developing new mobile games, we will not be able to generate revenues and you will lose your investment. We have not completed developing of our first mobile game and we have no revenues from the sale or use of our game. The success of our proposed business will depend on the completion and the acceptance of our games by the general public. Achieving such acceptance will require significant marketing investment. Our games, may not be accepted by our players at sufficient levels to support our operations and build our business. If our games is not accepted at sufficient levels, our business will fail. 9 | Page We currently have no protection by any trademarks, patents and/or other intellectual property registrations. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our proposed business will fail. We have not applied for any trademark, patent or other intellectual property registration with any governmental agency for our name or for our software product. Despite our precautions taken to protect our proposed software programs, unauthorized parties may attempt in the future to reverse engineer, copy or obtain and use our games. If they are successful we could lose our technology or they could develop similar mobile games, which could create more competition for us and even cause our proposed business operations to fail. We intend to become subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which will require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs will negatively affect our ability to earn a profit. Following the effective date of the registration statement in which this prospectus is included, we will be required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder. In order to comply with such requirements, our independent registered auditors will have to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel will have to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. Factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot accurately be determined at this time and may have a major negative effect on the cost and amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit. However, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (A) following the fifth anniversary of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement, (B) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (C) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, defines a smaller reporting company as an issuer that is not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer), or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that is not a smaller reporting company and that: · Had a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of shares of its voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates by the price at which the common equity was last sold, or the average of the bid and asked prices of common equity, in the principal market for the common equity; or 10 | Page · In the case of an initial registration statement under the Securities Act or Exchange Act for shares of its common equity, had a public float of less than $75 million as of a date within 30 days of the date of the filing of the registration statement, computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of such shares held by non-affiliates before the registration plus, in the case of a Securities Act registration statement, the number of such shares included in the registration statement by the estimated public offering price of the shares; or · In the case of an issuer whose public float as calculated under paragraph (1) or (2) of this definition was zero, had annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available. We qualify as a smaller reporting company, and so long as we remain a smaller reporting company, we benefit from the same exemptions and exclusions as an emerging growth company. In the event that we cease to be an emerging growth company as a result of a lapse of the five year period, but continue to be a smaller reporting company, we would continue to be subject to the exemptions available to emerging growth companies until such time as we were no longer a smaller reporting company. After, and if ever, we are no longer an emerging growth company, we expect to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are not emerging growth companies, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves to this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Since our officers and sole director have the ability to be employed by or consult for other companies, their other activities could slow down our operations. Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov and Aleksandr Gilev, our officers, are not required to work exclusively for us and does not devote all of their time to our operations. Therefore, it is possible that a conflict of interest with regard to their time may arise based on their employment by other companies. Their other activities may prevent them from devoting full-time to our operations which could slow our operations and may reduce our financial results because of the slowdown in operations. It is expected that Mr. Rivera Tchernikov and Mr. Gilev will devote between 10 and 20 hours per week to our operations on an ongoing basis, and when required will devote whole days and even multiple days at a stretch if our operations increase. We do not have any written procedures in place to address conflicts of interest that may arise between our business and the business activities of our sole director and officers. We have no employment or compensation agreements with our officers and sole director, and as such, they may have little incentive to devote time and energy to the operation of the Company. Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov, our officer and sole director and Aleksandr Gilev, our secretary, are not subject to any employment or compensation agreement with the Company. Therefore, it is possible that Mr. Rivera Tchernikov and Mr. Gilev may decide to focus his efforts on other projects or companies which have a higher economic benefit to them. Currently, Mr. Rivera Tchernikov and Mr. Gilev are not obligated to spend any time at all on Company business and could opt to leave the Company for other opportunities or focus on other business which could negatively impact the Companys ability to succeed. We do not have any expectation that our officers and sole director will enter into an employment or compensation agreement with the Company in the foreseeable future and the loss of them would be highly detrimental to our ability to conduct ongoing operations. 11 | Page Because we may have fewer than three hundred shareholders of record after this offering, we may be able to terminate or suspend our reporting obligations, and if we do that, our shares of common stock will not be eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board and OTC Link. Although we have no intention to do so, we will have the ability to terminate or suspend our reporting obligations to the SEC if we will have fewer than three hundred shareholders of record after this offering. If we terminate or suspend our reporting obligations to file reports with the SEC, our shares of common stock will not be eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board and OTC Link, which could impact your ability to sell your shares of common stock. The lack of public company experience of our management could adversely impact our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of U.S. securities laws. Our officers and sole director lack public company experience, which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Aleksandr Gilev, our secretary and Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov, our officer and sole director, have never been responsible for managing a publicly traded company. Such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which is necessary to maintain our public company status. If we were to fail to fulfill those obligations, our ability to continue as a U.S. public company would be in jeopardy in which event you could lose your entire investment in our company. It will be extremely difficult to acquire jurisdiction and enforce liabilities against our officers, directors and assets outside the United States. Our assets are currently located outside of the United States. Additionally, our officers and sole director resides outside of the United States, in Evora, Portugal. As a result, it may not be possible for United States investors to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon our officers and director or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties of our directors and officers under Federal securities laws. RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK We are selling our offering of 10,000,000 shares of common stock without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any shares. Our offering of 10,000,000 shares is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to sell our shares through our officers and sole director, who will receive no commissions. The will offer the shares to friends, family members, and business associates, however, there is no guarantee that they will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless they are successful in selling all of the shares and we receive the proceeds from this offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan. Because there is no minimum proceeds the Company can receive from its offering of 10,000,000 shares, the Company may not raise sufficient capital to implement its planned business and your entire investment could be lost The Company is making its offering of 10,000,000 shares of common stock on a best-efforts basis and there is no minimum amount of proceeds the Company may receive. Funds raised under this offering will not be held in trust or in any escrow account and all funds raised regardless of the amount will be available to the Company. In the event the company does not raise sufficient capital to implement its planned operations, your entire investment could be lost. The Company will not be able to complete developing of its first mobile game or production of new mobile games on either the Android or Apple platform unless a minimum of 50% of the shares being offered are sold. There is no liquidity and no established public market for our common stock and we may not be successful at obtaining a quotation on a recognized quotation service. In such event it may be difficult to sell your shares. There is presently no public market in our shares. There can be no assurance that we will be successful at developing a public market or in having our common stock quoted on a quotation facility such as the OTC Bulletin Board and/or OTC Link. There are risks associated with obtaining a quotation, including that broker dealers will not be willing to make a market in our shares, or to request that our shares be quoted on a quotation service. In addition, even if a quotation is obtained, the OTC Bulletin Board, and/or OTC Link and similar quotation services are often characterized by low trading volumes, and price volatility, which may make it difficult for an investor to sell our common stock on acceptable terms. If trades in our common stock are not quoted on a quotation facility, it may be very difficult for an investor to find a buyer for their shares in our Company. 12 | Page Our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the trading market in our securities is limited, which makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock. Under U.S. federal securities legislation, our common stock will constitute penny stock. Penny stock is any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require that a broker or dealer approve a potential investors account for transactions in penny stocks, and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve an investors account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person, and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination. Brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock. Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. We may, in the future, issue additional common shares, which would reduce investors percent of ownership and may dilute our share value. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 75,000,000 shares of common stock. As of the date of this prospectus, the Company had 5,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding. Accordingly, we may issue up to an additional 70,000,000 shares of common stock. The future issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders. We may value any common stock in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock. There is no current trading market for our securities and if a trading market does not develop, purchasers of our securities may have difficulty selling their shares. There is currently no established public trading market for our securities and an active trading market in our securities may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. We intend to have an application filed for admission to quotation of our securities on the OTC Bulletin Board and/or OTC Link after this prospectus is declared effective by the SEC. If for any reason our common stock is not quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board nor on the OTC Link or a public trading market does not otherwise develop, purchasers of the shares may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so. No market makers have committed to becoming market makers for our common stock and none may do so. We intend to become subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which will require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs will negatively affect our ability to earn a profit. Following the effective date of the registration statement in which this prospectus is included, we will be required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder. In order to comply with such requirements, our independent registered auditors will have to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel will have to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. Although we believe that the approximately $10,000 we have estimated for these costs should be sufficient for the 12-month period following the completion of our offering, the costs charged by these professionals for such services may vary significantly. Factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot accurately be determined at this time and may have a major negative affect on the cost and amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit. However, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that you become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. After, and if ever, we are no longer an emerging growth company, we expect to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are not emerging growth companies, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 13 | Page We are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves to this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Because we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. We intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. There is no assurance that stockholders will be able to sell shares when desired. 14 | Page USE OF PROCEEDS Our public offering of 10,000,000 shares is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $200,000 as anticipated. 25% of 50% of 75% of 100% of shares sold shares sold shares sold shares sold Gross Proceeds from this Offering (1): $ 50,000 $ 100,000 $ 150,000 $ 200,000 Costs associated with being a reporting issuer $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 Marketing campaign $ - $ 39,900 $ 48,900 $ 57,900 Office setup $ 1,000 $ 2,000 $ 3,000 $ 4,000 Apple developer program $ 100 $ 100 $ 100 $ 100 Mobile game software development $ 30,900 $ 40,000 $ 80,000 $ 120,000 Offering expenses $ 8,000 $ 8,000 $ 8,000 $ 8,000 Totals $ 50,000 $ 100,000 $ 150,000 $ 200,000 (1) Expenditures for the 12 months following the completion of this offering. The expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity. Please see a detailed description of the use of proceeds in the Plan of Operation section of this prospectus. DETERMINATION OF THE OFFERING PRICE The offering price of the 10,000,000 shares being offered has been determined arbitrarily by us. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities. DILUTION The price of our offering of 10,000,000 shares is fixed at $0.02 per share. This price is significantly higher than the $0.001 price per share paid by Aleksandr Guilev, our secretary, and Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov, our officer and sole director, for the 5,000,000 shares of common stock they purchased on March 10, 2017 and March 17, 2017 respectively. Dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders. The following tables compare the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing stockholders. 15 | Page As of March 31, 2017, the net tangible book value of our shares of common stock was $190 or approximately $0 per share based upon 5,000,000 shares outstanding. Existing Stockholders if all of the Shares are Sold Price per share $ 0.02 Net tangible book value per share before offering $ 0 Potential gain to existing shareholders $ 200,000 Net tangible book value per share after offering $ 0.0128 Increase to present stockholders in net tangible book value per share after offering $ 0.0128 Capital contributions $ 5,000 Number of shares outstanding before the offering 5,000,000 Number of shares after offering held by existing stockholders 15,000,000 Percentage of ownership after offering 33.33 % Purchasers of Shares in this Offering if all Shares Sold Price per share $ 0.02 Dilution per share $ 0.0072 Net tangible book value per share after offering $ 0.0128 Capital contributions $ 200,000 Percentage of capital contributions 97.56 % Number of shares after offering held by public investors 10,000,000 Percentage of ownership after offering 66.67 % Purchasers of Shares in this Offering if 75% of Shares Sold Price per share $ 0.02 Dilution per share $ 0.0087 Net tangible book value per share after offering $ 0.0113 Capital contributions $ 150,000 Percentage of capital contributions 96.77 % Number of shares after offering held by public investors 7,500,000 Percentage of ownership after offering 60.0 % Purchasers of Shares in this Offering if 50% of Shares Sold Price per share $ 0.02 Dilution per share $ 0.0108 Net tangible book value per share after offering $ 0.0092 Capital contributions $ 100,000 Percentage of capital contributions 95.24 % Number of shares after offering held by public investors 5,000,000 Percentage of ownership after offering 50.0 % Purchasers of Shares in this Offering if 25% of Shares Sold Price per share $ 0.02 Dilution per share $ 0.0144 Net tangible book value per share after offering $ 0.0056 Capital contributions $ 50,000 Percentage of capital contributions 90.91 % Number of shares after offering held by public investors 2,500,000 Percentage of ownership after offering 33.33 % DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES GENERAL There is no established public trading market for our common stock. Our authorized capital stock consists of 75,000,000shares of common stock, with $0.001 par value per share. As of June 12, 2017, there were 5,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding that were held by 2 stockholders of record, and no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. 16 | Page COMMON STOCK The following is a summary of the material rights and restrictions associated with our common stock. This description does not purport to be a complete description of all of the rights of our stockholders and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the provisions of our most current Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, which are included as exhibits to this Registration Statement. The holders of our common stock currently have (i) equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available therefore, when, as and if declared by the Board of Director of the Company; (ii) are entitled to share ratably in all of the assets of the Company available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company (iii) do not have pre-emptive, subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights applicable thereto; and (iv) are entitled to one non-cumulative vote per share on all matters on which stock holders may vote. Our Bylaws provide that at all meetings of the stockholders for the election of directors, a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. On all other matters, except as otherwise required by Nevada law or the Articles of Incorporation, a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the stockholders shall be necessary to authorize any corporate action to be taken by vote of the stockholders. A plurality means the excess of the votes cast for one candidate over any other. When there are more than two competitors for the same office, the person who receives the greatest number of votes has a plurality. We do not have any preferred stock authorized in our Articles of Incorporation, and we have no warrants, options or other convertible securities issued or outstanding. FUTURE SALES BY EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS A total of 5,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to sole officers and sole director, all of which are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 of the Rules and Regulations of the SEC promulgated under the Securities Act. Under Rule 144, the shares can be publicly sold, subject to volume restrictions and restrictions on the manner of sale. Such shares can only be sold after six months provided that the issuer of the securities is, and has been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Shares purchased in this offering, which will be immediately resalable, and sales of all of our other shares after applicable restrictions expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price, if any, of our common stock and the shares we are offering. There is no public trading market for our common stock. To be quoted on the OTCBB and/or OTC Link a market maker must file an application on our behalf to make a market for our common stock. As of the date of this Registration Statement, we have not engaged a market maker to file such an application, that there is no guarantee that a market marker will file an application on our behalf, and that even if an application is filed, there is no guarantee that we will be accepted for quotation. 17 | Page DIVIDEND POLICY We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We have 5,000,000 common shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus. The Company is registering 10,000,000 shares of its common stock for sale at the price of $0.02 per share. There is no arrangement to address the possible effect of the offering on the price of the stock. In connection with the Companys selling efforts in the offering, Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov and Aleksandr Gilev will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Exchange Act, but rather will rely upon the safe harbor provisions of SEC Rule 3a4-1, promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Generally speaking, Rule 3a4-1 provides an exemption from the broker-dealer registration requirements of the Exchange Act for persons associated with an issuer that participate in an offering of the issuers securities. Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov and Aleksandr Gilev are not subject to any statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act. Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov and Aleksandr Gilev will not be compensated in connection with their participation in the offering by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in our securities. Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov and Aleksandr Gilev are not, nor have he been within the past 12 months, a broker or dealer, and they are not, nor have he been within the past 12 months, an associated person of a broker or dealer. At the end of the offering, Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov and Aleksandr Gilev will continue to primarily perform substantial duties for the Company or on its behalf otherwise than in connection with transactions in securities. Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov and Aleksandr Gilev will not participate in selling an offering of securities for any issuer more than once every 12 months other than in reliance on Exchange Act Rule 3a4-1(a)(4)(i) or (iii). We will receive all proceeds from the sale of the 10,000,000 shares being offered. The price per share is fixed at $0.02 for the duration of this offering. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange or quoted over-the-counter, we intend to seek to have our shares of common stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and/or OTC Link. In order to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and/or OTC Link, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. The Companys shares may be sold to purchasers from time to time directly by and subject to the discretion of the Company. Further, the Company will not offer its shares for sale through underwriters, dealers, agents or anyone who may receive compensation in the form of underwriting discounts, concessions or commissions from the Company and/or the purchasers of the shares for whom they may act as agents. The shares of common stock sold by the Company may be occasionally sold in one or more transactions; all shares sold under this prospectus will be sold at a fixed price of $0.02 per share. In order to comply with the applicable securities laws of certain states, the securities will be offered or sold in those only if they have been registered or qualified for sale; an exemption from such registration or if qualification requirement is available and with which we have complied. In addition, and without limiting the foregoing, we will be subject to applicable provisions, rules and regulations under the Exchange Act with regard to security transactions during the period of time when this Registration Statement is effective. We will pay all expenses incidental to the registration of the shares (including registration pursuant to the securities laws of certain states). 18 | Page Terms of the Offering The shares will be sold at the fixed price of $0.02 per share until the completion of this offering. There is no minimum amount of subscription required per investor, and subscriptions, once received, are irrevocable. This offering will commence on the date of this prospectus and continue for a period of 9 months. At the discretion of our board of director, we may discontinue the offering before expiration of the 9-month period. Penny Stock Rules The Securities Exchange Commission has also adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks as such term is defined by Rule 15g-9. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange). The shares offered by this prospectus constitute penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act. The shares will remain penny stock for the foreseeable future. The classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a broker-dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate his or her investment. Any broker-dealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares in our company will be subject to the penny stock rules. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, which: (i) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; (ii) contains a description of the brokers or dealers duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of Securities laws; (iii) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (iv) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; (v) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and (vi) contains such other information and is in such form as the Commission shall require by rule or regulation. The broker-dealer also must provide to the customer, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, (i) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; (ii) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; (iii) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (iv) monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS On September 9, 2014, the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. We are engaged in the business of the development and sale of mobile games for the Apple and Android platforms. Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov has served as our President, Treasurer and as a Director and Aleksandr Gilev has served as our Secretary, from September 9, 2014, until the current date. Our board of directors is comprised of one person: Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov. We are authorized to issue 75,000,000shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share. On March 10, 2017, Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov, our president, treasurer and sole director purchased an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.001 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $3,000. On March 17, 2017, Aleksandr Gilev, our secretary purchased an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.001 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $2,000. IN GENERAL We were incorporated on September 9, 2014 in the State of Nevada. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. We are not a blank check registrant, as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, since we have a specific business plan or purpose. We have not had preliminary contact or discussions with, nor do we have any present plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with, any representatives of the owners of any business or company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger. From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating activities, primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company, the initial equity funding by our officers and sole director, developing our first mobile game, developing concepts for new mobile games, and engaging in market research. We received our initial funding of $5,000 through the sale of common stock to our officers and sole director, who purchased an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares at $0.001 per share. 19 | Page Our financial statements from inception (September 9, 2014) through our first fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 report no revenues and a net loss of $1,475. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for our Company which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We are a start-up company which is in the business of the development and sale of mobile games for the Apple and Android platforms. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations. To implement our plan of operations we require a minimum funding of $100,000 for the next twelve months. After twelve months period, we may need additional financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for SEC filing requirements. If we do not sell at least 500,000 shares of our common stock (5% of the shares being offered) we will not be able to maintain our reporting status with the SEC and remain in good standing with the state of Nevada without additional funds. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. We will also need more funds if the cost of developing of new mobile games is greater than we have budgeted. We will also require additional financing to sustain our business operations if we are not successful in earning revenues. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise such additional funding. We have no revenues and have incurred losses since inception. The Companys principal offices are located at Rua da Moeda 19, Evora, Portugal 7000-513. Our operations to date have been devoted primarily to start-up and development activities, which include: (i) formation of the Company; (ii) development of our business plan; (iii) market research, (iv) developing our first mobile game and (v) developing concepts for new mobile games. OUR BUSINESS OF MOBILE GAMES We plan to develop and sell mobile games for the Apple and Android platforms. We have been developing our first mobile game for Android platform and plan to develop new games. We need to join the Apple Developer Program, which will cost us US$99/year to complete development our first game for iOS devices. We have also started to develop concepts for new mobile games but there is no guarantee that we ever develop these game. We will develop other mobile games when/if our first mobile game is successful or we have available funds for further development. MOBILE GAMES A mobile game is a video game played on a feature phone, smartphone PDA, tablet computer, portable media player or calculator. Mobile games are played using the technology present on the device itself. For networked games, there are various technologies in common use. Examples include text message (SMS), multimedia message (MMS) or GPS location identification. However, there are non-networked applications that simply use the device platform to run the game software. Today, mobile games are usually downloaded from app stores as well as from mobile operator's portals, but in some cases are also preloaded in the handheld devices by the OEM or by the mobile operator when purchased, via infrared connection, Bluetooth, memory card or side loaded onto the handset with a cable. We plan to develop and sell mobile games for the Apple and Android platforms. We have been developing our first mobile game for Android platform and Apple platform. During development of our application we need to join the Apple Developer Program, which will cost us US$99/year. We have started to develop a concept for our new mobile games but there is no guarantee that we ever develop these game. We will develop other mobile games when/if our first mobile game is successful or we have available funds for further development. 20 | Page THE MARKET According to eMarketer.com, t he mobile gaming audience in the US continues to grow steadily, even though gaming is already a common activity. More than two-thirds of mobile phone users and nearly 56% of the US population will play games on their phone at least monthly in 2016, eMarketer estimates. The sustained popularity of gaming apps and new smartphone users will primarily drive this growth. By 2020, 77.0% of mobile phone users, and nearly 64% of the US population will play games on their phone at least once per month. Mobile gaming is not just happening on smartphone devices, but on tablets as well. According to eMarketer estimates, more than 120 million people, or 72.5% of tablet users, will play games on a tablet at least once per month in 2016. By 2020, half of the US digital audience will play tablet games. The number of tablet gamers will rise 6.6% this year and audience growth will remain steady over the forecast period. This year, there will be 120.9 million tablet gamers, and by 2020, that number will increase to 140.3 million tablet gamers. Table 1. US MOBILE PHONE GAMERS AND PENETRATION, 2014-2020 REVENUE Mobile game developers can propose and publish their applications on the stores, being rewarded by a revenue sharing of the selling price. Most famous is Apples App Store, where only approved mobile games and applications may be distributed and run on iOS devices, such as iPod, iPhone and iPad. The service allows users to browse and download applications from the iTunes Store that were developed with the iOS SDK or Mac SDK and published through Apple, Inc. Depending on the application, they are available either for free or at a cost. The applications can be downloaded directly to a target device, or downloaded onto a PC or Mac via iTunes. 30% of revenue from the store goes to Apple, and 70% go to the producer of the application. Google Play (formerly Android Market) is another big and popular digital distribution service operated and developed by Google. It serves as the official app store for the Android operating system, allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the Android software development kit (SDK) and published through Google. Google Play also serves as a digital media store, offering music, magazines, books, movies, and television programs. It previously offered Google hardware devices for purchase until the introduction of a separate online hardware retailer, Google Store, on March 11, 2015. Applications are available through Google Play either free of charge or at a cost. They can be downloaded directly to an Android device through the Play Store mobile app, or by deploying the application to a device from the Google Play website. Applications exploiting hardware capabilities of a device can be targeted to users of devices with specific hardware components, such as a motion sensor (for motion-dependent games) or a front-facing camera (for online video calling). The Google Play store had over 50 billion app downloads in 2013 and has reached over 2.7 million apps published in 2017. Google Play was launched on March 6, 2012, bringing together the Android Market, Google Music, and the Google eBookstore under one brand, marking a shift in Google's digital distribution strategy. For applications and in-app products that are sold on Google Play, the transaction fee is equivalent to 30% of the price. The developer receives 70% of the payment. The remaining 30% goes to the distribution partner and operating fees. We plan to generate revenue from the following sources: - Sale of our mobile games We plan to sell our mobile games on the App Stores site. Apple and Google claim 30% of the revenue from the sale of each app, leaving us with 70%. - In-game purchases In-game purchases refer to items or points that a player can buy for use within a virtual word to improve a character or enhance the playing experience. The virtual goods that the player receives in exchange for real-world money are non-physical and are generally created by the game  s producer. - In-game ads One of the major benefits of advertising on a mobile game is that advertisers can take advantage of the users geographic and demographic information and target their ads appropriately. Revenue is generated according to the PPC (Pay Per Click) model, where advertisers pay the hosting service a flat rate each time the ad is clicked. 21 | Page MARKETING AND SALES STRATEGY We plan for our mobile games to be marketed as following: - Social Media: we intend to have a strong presence with Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Google Analytics. We will create forums for users to engage with and support our product, such as a Facebook fan page, blog entries and tweets that followers can re-post or link to; - Mobile games review websites: Send out mobile games to mobile games review websites and blogs; - Advertising: We plan to advertise on mobile ad networks; - Press Releases: We will send out a press release in order get our mobile games noticed by the traditional media  newspapers and magazines; - We plan to develop a website with the information about our mobile games. We intend to spend from $30,900 to $57,900 on marketing efforts during the first year. There is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and more importantly retain enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue and to successfully protect ourselves against those risks, then it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed. COMPETITION The mobile game market is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Our ability to compete depends upon many factors within and outside our control, including the timely development and introduction of our mobile games and its enhancements, its functionality, performance, reliability, customer service and support and marketing efforts. Due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the mobile game market, we expect additional competition from other emerging companies. Many of the Companys existing and potential competitors are substantially larger than us and have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the development and promotion of their mobile games. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. EMPLOYEES; IDENTIFICATION OF CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEES. We are a start-up company and currently have no employees other than our officers and director. Aleksandr Gilev, our Secretary and Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov, our President, Treasurer and sole director handle the Companys day-to-day operations. We intend to hire employees on an as needed basis. INSURANCE We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a legal action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations. OFFICES The Companys principal offices are located at Rua da Moeda 19, Evora, Portugal 7000-513. GOVERNMENT REGULATION We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities in the future. As of now there are no required government approvals present that we need approval from or any existing government regulation on our business. We currently have not obtained any copyrights, patents or trademarks. We do not anticipate filing any copyright or trademark applications related to any assets over the next 12 months. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS There are no pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or in which any director, officer or affiliate of the Company, any owner of record or beneficially of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of the Company, or security holder is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company. 22 | Page MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS MARKET INFORMATION ADMISSION TO QUOTATION ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD We intend to have our common stock be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and/or OTC Link. If our securities are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and/nor OTC Link, a security holder may find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our securities. The OTC Bulletin Board differs from national and regional stock exchanges in that it: (i) is not situated in a single location but operates through communication of bids, offers and confirmations between broker-dealers, and (ii) securities admitted to quotation are offered by one or more Broker-dealers rather than the specialist common to stock exchanges. To qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board and/or OTC Link, an equity security must have one registered broker-dealer, known as the market maker, willing to list bid or sale quotations and to sponsor the company listing. We do not yet have an agreement with a registered broker-dealer, as the market maker, willing to list bid or sale quotations and to sponsor the Company listing. If the Company meets the qualifications for trading securities on the OTC Bulletin Board and/or OTC Link our securities will trade on the OTC Bulletin Board and/or OTC Link until a future time, if at all. We may not now and it may never qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board and/or OTC Link. TRANSFER AGENT We have not retained a transfer agent to serve as transfer agent for shares of our common stock. Until we engage such a transfer agent, we will be responsible for all record-keeping and administrative functions in connection with the shares of our common stock. HOLDERS As of the date of this prospectus, the Company had 5,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding held by 2 holders of record. DIVIDEND POLICY We have not declared or paid dividends on our common stock since our formation, and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Declaration or payment of dividends, if any, in the future, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our then current financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. There are no contractual restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends. See the Risk Factor entitled, Because we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. SECURITIES AUTHORIZED UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS We have no equity compensation or stock option plans. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION Certain statements contained in this prospectus, including statements regarding the anticipated development and expansion of our business, our intent, belief or current expectations, primarily with respect to the future operating performance of the Company and the products we expect to offer and other statements contained herein regarding matters that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements. Future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, future press releases and future oral or written statements made by us or with our approval, which are not statements of historical fact, may contain forward-looking statements, because such statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they are made. PLAN OF OPERATION Our cash balance is $2,100 as of March 31, 2017. We do not believe that our cash balance is sufficient to fund our operations. Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage. To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. While we believe that we will be able to raise enough money through this offering to expand operations, there is no assurance that we will be able to sell any of the securities being offered, and we cannot guarantee that once we expand operations we will stay in business after doing so. 23 | Page If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Even if we raise $200,000 from this offering, it will last one year, but we may need more funds to develop growth strategy, and we will have to revert to obtaining additional money. In the next twelve months, following completion of our public offering, we plan to engage in the following activities to expand our business operations as follows. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $200,000 as anticipated. 25% of 50% of 75% of 100% of shares sold shares sold shares sold shares sold Gross Proceeds from this Offering (1): $ 50,000 $ 100,000 $ 150,000 $ 200,000 Costs associated with being a reporting issuer $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 Marketing campaign $ - $ 39,900 $ 48,900 $ 57,900 Office setup $ 1,000 $ 2,000 $ 3,000 $ 4,000 Apple developer program $ 100 $ 100 $ 100 $ 100 Mobile game software development $ 30,900 $ 40,000 $ 80,000 $ 120,000 Offering expenses $ 8,000 $ 8,000 $ 8,000 $ 8,000 Totals $ 50,000 $ 100,000 $ 150,000 $ 200,000 (1) Expenditures for the 12 months following the completion of this offering. The expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity. We intend to develop and sell mobile games for iOS devices and Android OS devices. After the effectiveness of our registration statement by the Securities and Exchange Commissions, we intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital. During this period, our operations will be limited due to the limited amount of funds on hand. Our plan of operations is as follows: The offering will commence promptly on the date upon which this prospectus is declared effective by the SEC and will continue for 9 months. In the twelve months, following completion of our public offering we plan to do the following activities to expand our business operations: Set up Office. Time Frame: 1 st  3 rd months. Estimated cost: $2,000-$5,000 Upon completion of our offering we plan to set up office and acquire the necessary equipment to begin operations. We believe that it will cost at least $2,000 to set up office and obtain the necessary equipment to begin operations. Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov and Aleksandr Gilev, our officers will handle our administrative duties. Join the Apple Developer Program. Time Frame: 2 nd  3 rd months. Estimated cost: $99 Apple Developer is Apple Inc.s developer network. It is designed to make available resources to help software developers write software for the Mac OS X and iOS platforms. To be registered as an Apple developer means to have access to a complete set of technical resources, support, pre-release software and everything needed to create applications for iPod, iPhone and iPad. Apple Inc. allows anyone register as an Apple Developer. The cost is US$99/year per developer program. As soon as our office is established and the necessary equipment is purchased we will register to Apple Developer Program. 24 | Page Develop Mobile Games. Time Frame: 2 nd - 12 th months. Estimated cost: $40,000-$120,000 When our office is set up and we are approved for the Apple Developer Program, we intend to complete our first mobile game development and begin developing new mobile games. The approximate cost for the game development is $40,000. We must sell at least 50% of shares in this offering to complete developing and marketing and promotion of our first game and have the funds to develop new mobile games. However, there is no assurance that we sell any shares in this offering. In this case, we will need additional financing. As of the date of this prospectus, we have not taken any steps to seek additional financing. Commence Marketing Campaign. Time Frame: 7 th -12 th months. Estimated cost: $30,900-$57,900 Once our mobile games are developed, we plan begin to market our service. We intend to use marketing strategies, such as web advertisements, internet promotion tools on Facebook and Twitter, social networking and word of mouth advertising. We also plan to use traditional advertising including newspapers and magazines. We intend to spend from $30,900-$57,900 on marketing efforts during the first year. Marketing is an ongoing matter that will continue during the life of our operations. ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT PLAN We intend to continue to have our President prepare our quarterly and annual financial statements and have these financial statements reviewed or audited by our independent auditor. Our independent auditor is expected to charge us approximately $1,850 to review our quarterly financial statements and approximately $3,500 to audit our annual financial statements. SEC FILING PLAN We intend to become a reporting company in 2017 after our registration statement on Form S-1 is declared effective. This means that we will file documents with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis. In the next twelve months, we anticipate spending approximately $10,000 costs in connection with our SEC filings, and $8,000 costs associated with filing the registration statement to register our common stock. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We have had no operating revenues since our inception on September 9, 2014, through March 31, 2017. Our activities have been financed from the sales of common stock of to our officers and sole director for aggregate proceeds of $5,000. From our inception to September 9, 2014 we have raised a total of 5,000 from private offerings of our common stock. For the year ended March 31, 2017, we incurred operating expenses of $1,475, consisting of $1,475 of general and administrative expenses. For the period from inception on September 9, 2014 to March 31, 2017, we incurred operating costs of $1,475. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At March 31, 2017, we had a cash balance of $2,100. Our expenditures over the next 12 months are expected to be approximately $200,000. We have no revenues, and based on our current cash position, we will only be able to maintain our status as a corporation in the State of Nevada for approximately 12 months, assuming we do not raise additional funding. We do not have sufficient current cash to cover our expenses for filing required quarterly and annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission or to fund our plan of operation. We must raise minimum $100,000, to complete our plan of operation for the next 12 months. We anticipate our costs of being a reporting company to be approximately $10,000 in connection with our public filings that will have to be made with the SEC on a quarterly basis. Additional funding will likely come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock, if we are able to sell such stock. If we are successful in completing an equity financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in our Company. We do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our plan of operation. In the absence of such financing, our business will fail. There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing. If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue our plan of operations, then we will not be able to continue our plan of operation for the next 12 months and our business will fail. 25 | Page GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATION We have not generated any revenues since inception. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had accumulated losses of $1,810. Our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on the accompanying financial statements regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements including arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization and Description of Business The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 9, 2014 and intends to commence operations in the business of mobile game development. We are a start-up company. Since inception through March 31, 2017 the Company has accumulated losses of $1,810. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes. The Companys bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to $250,000. At March 31, 2017, the Companys bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts. Basic Income (Loss) Per Share The Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC-260, Earnings per Share which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. Dividends The Company has not adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends. No dividends have been paid during any of the periods shown. Income Taxes The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences). The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Advertising Costs The Companys policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expense of $0 during as at March 31, 2017. Accounting Basis The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP accounting). The Company has adopted March 31 fiscal year end. 26 | Page Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. Recent accounting pronouncements We have reviewed all the recent accounting pronouncements issued to date of the issuance of these financial statements, and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the company. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Stock-Based Compensation As of March 31, 2017, the Company has not issued any stock-based payments to its employees. Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and 123® (ASC 718). To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. Revenue Recognition The Company will recognize revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured. Other Recently Issued, but not yet Effective Accounting Pronouncements Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, PROMOTERS AND CONTROL PERSONS Our executive officers and directors and their respective ages are as follows: Name Age Positions Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov 24 President, Treasurer and Director Aleksandr Gilev 34 Secretary Set forth below is a brief description of the background and business experience of our executive officers and sole director for the past five years. ADRIAN DARIO RIVERA TCHERNIKOV Mr. Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov has served as President, Treasurer and our sole director since September 9, 2014. Since 2015, he has been studding in the University of Évora, Portugal, department of architecture. Since 2011. Mr. Rivera Tchernikov has been working as a freelance mobile app developer. Mr. Rivera Tchernikovs desire to found our company led to our conclusion that Mr. Rivera Tchernikov should be serving as a member of our board of directors in light of our business and structure. ALEKSANDR GILEV Mr. Aleksandr Gilev has served as Secretary since September 9, 2014. For the last 10 years, Mr. Gilev has been working as a freelance applications developer manager. TERM OF OFFICE All directors hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. The Companys Bylaws provide that the Board of Directors will consist of no less than one member. Officers are elected by and serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors. 27 | Page DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Our board of directors is currently composed of one member, who does not qualifiy as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market (the Company has no plans to list on the NASDAQ Global Market). The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, our board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to our director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations, our board of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by directors and us with regard to our directors business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management. SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS We currently have no employees, other than our officers, Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov and Aleksandr Gilev. AUDIT COMMITTEE AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our president and sole director. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit committee financial expert, nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion that such committees are not necessary since the Company is an early start-up company and has only one director, and to date, such sole director has been performing the functions of such committees. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our sole director and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation, nominations, and audit issues that may affect management decisions. There are no family relationships among our directors or officers. Other than as described above, we are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executive officers or directors. INVOLVEMENT IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS No director, person nominated to become a director, executive officer, promoter or control person of our company has, during the last ten years: (i) been convicted in or is currently subject to a pending a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to any federal or state securities or banking or commodities laws including, without limitation, in any way limiting involvement in any business activity, or finding any violation with respect to such law, nor (iii) any bankruptcy petition been filed by or against the business of which such person was an executive officer or a general partner, whether at the time of the bankruptcy or for the two years prior thereto. STOCKHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS We have not implemented a formal policy or procedure by which our stockholders can communicate directly with our board of directors. Nevertheless, every effort will be made to ensure that the views of stockholders are heard by the board of directors, and that appropriate responses are provided to stockholders in a timely manner. During the upcoming year, our board of directors will continue to monitor whether it would be appropriate to adopt such a process.

INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions described above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than our payment of expenses incurred or paid by our director, officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. We have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our legal counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit the question of whether such indemnification is against public policy to a court of appropriate jurisdiction. We will then be governed by the courts decision. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the Company pursuant to provisions of the State of Nevada, the Company has been informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our audited financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017 are included herewith.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Rivex Technology Corp. as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the periods then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Lepota Inc. for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note #2 to the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note #2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /S/ MICHAEL GILLESPIE & ASSOCIATES, PLLC Seattle, Washington May 29, 2017 F-1 RIVEX TECHNOLOGY CORP.

F-5 RIVEX TECHNOLOGY CORP. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017 (AUDITED) NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS RIVEX TECHNOLOGY CORP. (the Company) is a corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada on September 9, 2014. The company is the business of development and sale of mobile games for the Apple and Android platforms. The Company has adopted March 31 fiscal year end. NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN The Companys financial statements as of March 31, 2017, been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has accumulated loss from inception (September 9, 2014) to March 31, 2017 of $1,810. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Managements plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 3  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Use of Estimates Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company's bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to $250,000. At March 31, 2017 the Company's bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts. Advertising Costs The Companys policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company did not incur advertising expense during period ended March 31, 2017. Stock-Based Compensation As of March 31, 2017, the Company has not issued any stock-based payments to its employees. Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 718, when applicable. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. F-6 Income Taxes The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences). The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. New Accounting Pronouncements There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash flows. Start-Up Costs In accordance with ASC 720, Start-up Costs, the company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up and organization of the company. Fair Value Measurements The company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2  quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable Level 3  inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions) The company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis. Subsequent Events The Company has evaluated all transactions from March 31, 2017 through May 29, 2017 the date these financial statements were available for issuance and has determined that there are no items to disclose. NOTE 4  STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share. In March 2017, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of its common stock to the director and secretary at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $5,000. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had 5,000,000 shares issued and outstanding. NOTE 5  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS In support of the Companys efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note. Since September 9, 2014 (Inception) through March 31, 2017, the Companys sole officer and director loaned the Company $1,910 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses. As of March 31, 2017, the amount outstanding was $1,910. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured. NOTE 6. INCOME TAXES As of March 31, 2017 the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $1,810 that may be available to reduce future years taxable income through 2037. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards. F-7 PROSPECTUS 10,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK RIVEX TECHNOLOGY CORP. _______________ Dealer Prospectus Delivery Obligation Until _____________ ___, 20___, all dealers that effect transactions in these securities whether or not participating in this offering, may be required to deliver a prospectus.

PART II  INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS OTHER EXPENSES OF ISSUANCE AND DISTRIBUTION The following table sets forth the estimated expenses in connection with the issuance and distribution of the securities being registered hereby. All such expenses will be borne by the Company Amount Item (US$) SEC Registration Fee $ 23.18 Transfer Agent Fees 600.00 Legal Fees 2,000.00 Accounting Fees 6,000.00 Printing Costs 1,000.00 Miscellaneous 400.00 TOTAL $ 10,023.18 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS The Companys Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation provide that we shall, to the full extent permitted by the Nevada General Business Corporation Law, as amended from time to time (the Nevada Corporate Law), indemnify all of our directors and officers. Section 78.7502 of the Nevada Corporate Law provides in part that a corporation shall have the power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Similar indemnity is authorized for such persons against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred in defense or settlement of any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and provided further that (unless a court of competent jurisdiction otherwise provides) such person shall not have been adjudged liable to the corporation. Any such indemnification may be made only as authorized in each specific case upon a determination by the stockholders or disinterested directors that indemnification is proper because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct. Under our Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation, the indemnitee is presumed to be entitled to indemnification and we have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption. Where an officer or a director is successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any action referred to above, we must indemnify him against the expenses which such officer or director actually or reasonably incurred. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES Within the past three years we have issued and sold the following securities without registration: On March 10, 2017, we issued, pursuant to the terms of a stock subscription agreement, 3,000,000 shares of common stock to Adrian Dario Rivera Tchernikov, our President, Treasurer and sole Director, at a purchase price of $0.001 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $3,000. On March 17, 2017, we issued, pursuant to the terms of a stock subscription agreement, 2,000,000 shares of common stock to Aleksandr Gilev, our Secretary, at a purchase price of $0.001 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $2,000. Each of the foregoing offerings were made to non-U.S. persons, offshore of the U.S., with no directed selling efforts in the U.S., where offering restrictions were implemented in transactions pursuant to the exclusion from registration provided by Rule 903(b)(3) of Regulation S of the Securities Act.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act) may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
