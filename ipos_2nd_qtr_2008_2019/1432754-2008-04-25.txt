These products will be offered at direct-from-manufacturer prices enabling salons to cut costs. In addition to offering a vast array of equipment and products, we will feature industry information that will enhance the operations knowledge of salon owners.

Our principal executive office is located at 151-1201 LaRose Ave., Toronto, Ontario, Canada M9P 1B3. Our telephone number is (866) 536-2336 and our registered agent for service of process is the National Registered Agents Inc. of NV, located at 1000 East William Street, Suite 204, Carson City, Nevada 89701.

As of February 29, 2008 (Audited) Balance Sheet Total Assets $ 10,030 Total Liabilities $ 24,990 Stockholders Deficiency $ (14,960 ) Period from February 12, 2008 (date of inception) to February 29, 2008 (Audited) Income Statement Revenue $ - Total Expenses $ 15,010 Net Loss $ (15,010 ) RISK FACTORS Please consider the following risk factors before deciding to invest in our common stock. Risks associated with Cyber Supply Inc.: 1. Because our auditors have issued a going concern opinion and because our sole officer and director will not loan any additional money to us, we have to complete this offering to commence operations. If we do not complete this offering, we will not start our operations. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is doubt that we will be an ongoing business for the next twelve months. As of the date of this prospectus we have not commenced operations. Because our sole officer and director is unwilling to loan or advance any additional capital to us, except to prepare and file reports with the SEC, we will have to complete this offering in order to commence operations. 2. We lack an operating history and have losses that we expect to continue into the future. There is no assurance our future operations will result in profitable revenues. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably, we may suspend or cease operations. We were incorporated in February 2008 and we have not started our proposed business operations or realized any revenues. We have no operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Our net loss since inception is $15,010 of which $15,000 is for legal fees and $10 is for bank service fees. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon: -6- * completion of this offering * our ability to locate distributors who will sell us their equipment and products * our ability to attract clients who will buy our services from us and our website * our ability to generate revenues through the sale of our services Based upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will be incurring expenses and not generating revenues. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating revenues in the future. Failure to generate revenues will cause us to suspend or cease operations. 3. We have no clients and we cannot guarantee we will ever have any. Even if we obtain clients, there is no assurance that we will make a profit. We have no clients. We have not identified any clients and we cannot guarantee we ever will have any. Even if we obtain clients, there is no guarantee that we will be able to locate our clients who will buy our products. If we are unable to attract enough purveyors of services to offer their products/services for resale to us to offer our clients, or enough clients to buy the products/services from us and our website to operate profitably we will have to suspend or cease operations. 4. We are solely dependent upon the funds to be raised in this offering to start our business, the proceeds of which may be insufficient to achieve revenues. We may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available . We have not started our business. We need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations. If the minimum of $100,000 is raised, this amount will enable us, after paying the expenses of this offering, to begin the process of locating and sourcing purveyors of beauty supplies. It will also enable us to initiate development on our website, begin the gathering of information for our database, initiate the development of our marketing plans and initiate the development of marketing and support material such as brochures, flyers and fact sheets. We may need additional funds to complete further development of our business plan to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. 5. Because we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit marketing our services to potential clients and purveyors. As a result, we may not be able to attract enough clients to operate profitably. If we do not make a profit, we may have to suspend or cease operations . Because we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit marketing our website to potential clients and purveyors of salon equipment and products. The sale of products/services via our website is how we will initially generate revenues. Because we will be limiting our marketing activities, we may not be able to attract enough clients to buy or purveyors to sell products/services to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to suspend or cease operations. -7- 6. Because our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic which may result in periodic interruptions or suspensions of operations. This activity could prevent us from attracting purveyors and clients and result in a lack of revenues that may cause us to suspend or cease operations. Our sole officer and director, Maria Shostak, will only be devoting limited time to our operations. Ms. Shostak will be devoting approximately 15 hours per week of her time to our operations. Because our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient for her. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations. 7. Because our management does not have prior experience in the marketing of products or services via the Internet, we may have to hire individuals or suspend or cease operations. Because our management does not have prior experience in the marketing of products or services via the Internet, we may have to hire additional experienced personnel to assist us with our operations. If we need the additional experienced personnel and we do not hire them, we could fail in our plan of operations and have to suspend operations or cease operations entirely. 8. Because we have only one officer and director who has no formal training in financial accounting and management, who is responsible for our managerial and organizational structure, in the future, there may not be effective disclosure and accounting controls to comply with applicable laws and regulations which could result in fines, penalties and assessments against us. We have only one officer and director. She has no formal training in financial accounting and management, however, she is responsible for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. While Ms. Shostak has no formal training in financial accounting matters, she has been preparing the financial statements that have been audited and reviewed by our auditors and included in this prospectus. When the disclosure and accounting controls referred to above are implemented, she will be responsible for the administration of them. Should she not have sufficient experience, she may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to sanctions and fines by the SEC which ultimately could cause you to lose your investment, however, because of the small size of our expected operations, we believe that she will be able to monitor the controls she will have created and will be accurate in assembling and providing information to investors. Further, we have not considered and will not consider any activity beyond developing our website (www.cybersupplyinc.com). 9. If Ms. Shostak, our president and a director, should resign or die, we will not have a chief executive officer which could result in our operations suspending. If that should occur, you could lose your investment. Ms. Shostak is our sole officer and director. We are extremely dependent upon her to conduct our operations. If she should resign or die we will not have a chief executive officer. If that should occur, until we find another person to act as our chief executive officer, our operations could be suspended. In that event it is possible you could lose your entire investment. -8- 10. Because we do not have an escrow or trust account for your subscription, if we file for bankruptcy protection or are forced into bankruptcy, or a creditor obtains a judgment against us and attaches the subscription, or our officers and directors misappropriate the funds for their own use, you will lose your investment. Your funds will not be placed in an escrow or trust account. Accordingly, if we file for bankruptcy protection or a petition for involuntary bankruptcy is filed by creditors against us, your funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to the bankruptcy laws. If a creditor sues us and obtains a judgment against us, the creditor could garnish the bank account and take possession of the subscriptions. As such, it is possible that a creditor could attach your subscription which could preclude or delay the return of money to you. Further, our sole officer and director will have the power to appropriate the money we raise. As such, she could withdraw the funds without your knowledge for her own use. If that happens, you will lose your investment and your funds will be used to pay creditors. 11. Since our headquarters are located in Canada and most of our assets and key personnel are located in Canada, you may not be able to enforce any United States judgment for claims you may bring against us, our assets, our key personnel or the experts named in this prospectus. While we are organized under the laws of State of Nevada, our headquarters and sole officer and director are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be impossible for you to affect service of process within the United States upon us or these persons or to enforce against us or these persons any judgments in civil and commercial matters, including judgments under United States federal securities laws. In addition, a Canadian court may not permit you to bring an original action in Canada or to enforce in Canada a judgment of a U.S. court based upon civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. Risks associated with this offering: 12. Because our sole officer and director who is also our sole promoter, will own more than 50% of the outstanding shares after this offering, she will retain control of us and be able to decide who will be directors and you may not be able to elect any directors which could decrease the price and marketability of the shares. Even if we sell all 2,000,000 shares of common stock in this offering, Ms. Shostak will still own 5,000,000 shares and will continue to control us. As a result, after completion of this offering, regardless of the number of shares we sell, Ms. Shostak will be able to elect all of our directors and control our operations, which could decrease the price and marketability of the shares. 13. Because there is no public trading market for our common stock, you may not be able to resell your stock . There is currently no public trading market for our common stock. Therefore there is no central place, such as stock exchange or electronic trading system, to resell your shares. If you do want to resell your shares, you will have to locate a buyer and negotiate your own sale. -9- 14. Because the SEC imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokers who deal in our shares that are penny stocks, some brokers may be unwilling to trade them. This means that you may have difficulty reselling your shares and this may cause the price of the shares to decline. Our shares would be classified as penny stocks and are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokers/dealers who sell our securities in this offering or in the aftermarket. For sales of our securities, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination and receive from you a written agreement prior to making a sale for you. Because of the imposition of the foregoing additional sales practices, it is possible that brokers will not want to make a market in our shares. This could prevent you from reselling your shares and may cause the price of the shares to decline. USE OF PROCEEDS Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten $100,000 minimum, $200,000 maximum basis. The table below sets forth the use of proceeds if $100,000 or $200,000 of the offering is sold. $ 100,000 $ 200,000 Gross proceeds $ 100,000 $ 200,000 Offering expenses [1] $ 30,000 $ 30,000 Net proceeds $ 70,000 $ 170,000 [1] Of the $30,000 in offering expenses $25,000 will be repaid to Maria Shostak, our president and sole director, for expenses advanced for legal and accounting fees relating to this offering.

The foregoing are approximations. We spend between $15,000 and $30,000 for the preparation of our website which includes the cost of content creation and links to and from our website. -10- We intend to develop and maintain a database of all current salon owners/operators; hairstyling students and apprentices who may become salon owners or purchasing agents to develop a database of potential customers and their specific wants and needs. The estimated cost to develop and maintain the database is $10,000 to $20,000. Marketing and advertising will be focused on promoting our website to prospective salon product manufacturers and salon owners and purchasing agents based on the list of prospects developed from our database and the market survey. The advertising campaign will include the design and printing of various sales material. The cost of developing the campaign is estimated to cost between $15,000 to $30,000. We intend to establish an office to maintain the website and database. This will include physical office space, computer equipment, telephones and other assets as required to maintain the operations. If we raise the maximum amount under this offering, we intend to pay salaries to our officer, or, to outside employees or consultants to assist our officer in managing our business. In addition, we intend to hire one or two sales employees to handle Internet transactions with our customers. Working capital is the cost related to operating our office. It is comprised of expenses for rent, telephone service, mail, stationary, accounting, acquisition of office equipment and supplies, expenses of filing reports with the SEC, travel, and general working capital. DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The price of the shares we are offering was arbitrarily determined in order for us to raise up to a total of $200,000 in this offering. The offering price bears no relationship whatsoever to our assets, earnings, book value or other criteria of value. Among the factors considered were: * our lack of operating history * the proceeds to be raised by the offering * the amount of capital to be contributed by purchasers in this offering in proportion to the amount of stock to be retained by our existing Stockholder, and * our relative cash requirements. DILUTION OF THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR YOUR SHARES Dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders. -11- As of February 29, 2008, the net tangible book value of our shares of common stock was a deficit of ($14,960) or approximately ($0.01) per share based upon 5,000,000 shares outstanding.

You will incur an immediate dilution from $0.08 per share to $0.03 per share. After completion of this offering, if 2,000,000 shares are sold, you will own approximately 28.58% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which you will have made a cash investment of $200,000, or $0.10 per share. Our existing stockholders will own approximately 71.42% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which they have made contributions of cash totaling $50.00 or approximately $0.00001 per share. If 1,500,000 Shares Are Sold: Upon completion of this offering, in the event 1,500,000 shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 6,500,000 shares to be outstanding will be $105,040, or approximately $0.02 per share. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be increased by $0.02 per share without any additional investment on their part. You will incur an immediate dilution from $0.10 per share to $0.02 per share. After completion of this offering, if 1,500,000 shares are sold, you will own approximately 23.08% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which you will have made a cash investment of $150,000, or $0.10 per share. Our existing stockholders will own approximately 76.92% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which they have made contributions of cash totaling $50.00 or approximately $0.00001 per share. If the Minimum Number of the Shares Are Sold: Upon completion of this offering, in the event 1,000,000 shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 6,000,000 shares to be outstanding will be $55,040, or approximately $0.01 per share. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be increased by $0.01 per share without any additional investment on their part. You will incur an immediate dilution from $0.10 per share to $0.01 per share. After completion of this offering, if 1,000,000 shares are sold, you will own approximately 16.67% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which you will have made a cash investment of $100,000, or $0.06 per share. Our existing stockholders will own approximately 83.33% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which they have made contributions of cash totaling $50.00 or approximately $0.00001 per share. -12- The following table compares the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing stockholders.

Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act Our shares are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rules 15g-1 through 15g-6 and Rule 15g-9 promulgated thereunder. They impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouses). While Section 15(g) and Rules 15g-1 through 15g-6 apply to broker/dealers, they do not apply to us. Rule 15g-1 exempts a number of specific transactions from the scope of the penny stock rules. Rule 15g-2 declares unlawful broker/dealer transactions in penny stocks unless the broker/dealer has first provided to the customer a standardized disclosure document. -15- Rule 15g-3 provides that it is unlawful for a broker/dealer to engage in a penny stock transaction unless the broker/dealer first discloses and subsequently confirms to the customer current quotation prices or similar market information concerning the penny stock in question. Rule 15g-4 prohibits broker/dealers from completing penny stock transactions for a customer unless the broker/dealer first discloses to the customer the amount of compensation or other remuneration received as a result of the penny stock transaction. Rule 15g-5 requires that a broker/dealer executing a penny stock transaction, other than one exempt under Rule 15g-1, disclose to its customer, at the time of or prior to the transaction, information about the sales persons compensation. Rule 15g-6 requires broker/dealers selling penny stocks to provide their customers with monthly account statements. Rule 15g-9 requires broker/dealers to approved the transaction for the customer's account; obtain a written agreement from the customer setting forth the identity and quantity of the stock being purchased; obtain from the customer information regarding his investment experience; make a determination that the investment is suitable for the investor; deliver to the customer a written statement for the basis for the suitability determination; notify the customer of his rights and remedies in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions; and, the FINRAs toll free telephone number and the central number of the North American Administrators Association, for information on the disciplinary history of broker/dealers and their associated persons. The application of the penny stock rules may affect your ability to resell your shares.

Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. We are a start-up stage corporation and have not started operations or generated or realized any revenues from our business operations. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete the development of our website, source out suppliers for products to sell and source out customers to buy our products. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than operations. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in our company. We must raise cash to implement our project and begin our operations. Even if we raise the maximum amount of money in this offering, we do not know how long the money will last, however, we do believe it will last twelve months. We will not begin operations until we raise money from this offering. < /P> To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. We believe that we will be able to raise enough money through this offering to begin operations but we cannot guarantee that once we begin operations we will stay in business after operations have commenced. If we are unable to secure enough suppliers to provide us with equipment and products at suitably low pricing or enough customers willing to buy the products at higher than the price we have negotiated with our suppliers, we may quickly use up the proceeds from the minimum amount of money from this offering and will need to find alternative sources, like a second public offering, a private placement of securities, or loans from our sole officer or others in order for us to maintain our operations. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering. If we need addi tional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. If we raise the minimum amount of money from this offering, it will last a year but with limited funds available to develop growth strategy. If we raise the maximum amount, we believe the money will last a year and also provide funds for growth strategy. If we raise less than the maximum amount and we need more money, we will have to revert to obtaining additional money as described in this paragraph. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans. -17- Plan of Operation Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to profitably sell a comprehensive supply of products on our Internet website to the salon industry. We intend to accomplish the foregoing by the following steps. 1. Complete our public offering. We believe that we will raise sufficient capital to begin our operations. We believe this could take up to 180 days. We will not begin operations until we have closed this offering. We intend to concentrate all of our efforts on raising as much capital as we can during this period. 2. After completing the offering, we will immediately begin to establish our office and acquire the equipment we need to begin operations. Establishing our offices will take approximately a week. We have allocated $15,000 for the initial setup of the office. We do not intend to hire employees. Our sole officer and director will handle our administrative duties. A detailed breakdown of the cost of operating our office is set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. 3. We plan to retain a website developer to create a state-of-the-art website to promote our products. We expect to spend $15,000 to $30,000 for the website which will include graphics and links from our site. We also intend to begin sourcing out suppliers to offer their products for sale on our website and/or to provide a direct link from our site to theirs. We intend to locate and negotiate with large industry leaders such as Wella and Redken among others, to offer the best products and pricing on our website. We also intend to locate smaller, new manufacturers to offer their products on a more exclusive basis. In addition to offering an ever-changing and continually growing array of products for sale, the website will also feature industry information that will enhance the operations knowledge of salon owners and operators. We will also source-out and identify salon owners, operators and purchasing agent s who may become potential buyers of products from our website. The process of sourcing suppliers and customers may consist of telephone surveys and may contain questions which would determine the marketing approach and acceptability of specific products. It will also involve research into existing databases available via the Internet to target and extract the applicable names and contacts to create our own customized database. We intend to look into the databases of salon schools, hairdressing associates, trade magazines as well as telephone directories. The cost to source and analyze all of the material to identify suitable candidates to develop and maintain the database is estimated to cost up to $20,000 and could take up to four months. 4. Marketing and advertising will be focused on promoting our website to prospective product manufacturers and salon owners/operators and purchasing agents based on the list of prospects developed from our database and market survey. The advertising campaign may also include the design and printing of various sales material. We intend to market our website through traditional sources such as advertising in trade magazines, fashion magazines, womens magazines, attending conferences and conventions within the beauty/health arena, newspaper advertising, billboards, telephone directories and preparing and sending out flyers and mailers both through the regular mail and via email. Advertising and promotion will be an ongoing effort but the initial cost of developing the campaign is estimated to cost between $15,000 to $30,000. -18- 5. Once the website is fully functional and we have located and negotiated agreements with a suitable number of suppliers to offer their products for sale, we intend to hire 1 or 2 part-time salesperson(s) to call on salon owners/operators and purchasing agents to introduce them to our website. The salesperson(s) will also call on various hair salon product manufacturers to continue to source new products to offer for sale. We anticipate that we will generate revenues as soon as we are able to offer products for sale on our website. This will happen once we negotiated agreements with one or two large manufacturers to offer their products for sale on our website or to enable us to provide a direct link from our website to theirs with a pre-arranged fee structure in place. We expect to be profitable within 12 months of completion of our offering. We will not be conducting any research. We are not going to buy or sell any plant or significant equipment during the next twelve months. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to continue operations, we will suspend or cease operations. If we cease operations, we do not know what we will do and we do not have any plans to do anything else. Limited operating history; need for additional capital There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in a start-up stage operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. To become profitable and competitive, we have to locate and negotiate agreements with manufacturers to offer their products for sale to us at pricing that will enable us to establish and sell the products to our clientele. We are seeking equity financing to provide for the capital required to implement our operations. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. Results of operations From Inception on February 12, 2008 to February 29, 2008 During the period we incorporated the company, hired the attorney, and hired the auditor for the preparation of this registration statement. We have prepared an internal business plan. We have reserved the domain name www.cybersupplyinc.com . Our loss since inception is $15,010 of which $15,000 is for legal fees and $10 is for bank services fees. We have not started our proposed business operations and will not do so until we have completed this offering. We expect to begin operations 100 days after we complete this offering. -19- Since inception, we sold 5,000,000 shares of common stock to our sole officer and director for $50. Liquidity and capital resources As of the date of this prospectus, we have yet to generate any revenues from our business operations. We issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. This was accounted for as a sale of common stock. As of February 29, 2008, our total assets were $10,030 and our total liabilities were $24,990 comprising of $24,990 owing to Ms. Shostak, our sole president and director for payments made to our attorney for the incorporation of the company. As of February 29, 2008 we had cash of $10,030. -20- BUSINESS General We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 12, 2008. We are developing a website (www.cybersupplyinc.com) that will offer a comprehensive supply of products to the salon industry. We have not generated any revenues and the only operations we have engaged in is the creation of the website and the development of a business plan. We have no plans to change our business activities or to combine with another business, and we are not aware of any events or circumstances that might cause our plans to change. We have not begun operations and will not begin operations until we have completed this offering. Our plan of operation is forward looking and there is no assurance that we will ever begin operations. Our prospects for profitability are not favorable if you consider numerous Internet-based companies have failed to achieve profits with similar plans. Products We intend to offer a comprehensive supply of equipment and products to the salon industry on our Internet website. These products will be offered at direct-from-manufacturer prices. In addition to offering a vast array of equipment and products, we will feature industry information that will enhance the operations knowledge of salon owners and enable them to be connected in a fragmented industry. A brief list of products we intend to offer is as follows: Consumables: Small hair appliances: - shampoo - hair dryers - conditioners / detanglers - curling irons - hairsprays - flat irons - gels - clippers - mousse - foil - pomades / wax - perm rollers - permanent hair dyes - velcro rollers - semi permanent hair dyes - hair straighteners - nail products - polish, remover - permanent solutions -21- Website We intend to create and maintain a website which will provide the following services and products for the website: disk space, bandwidth, 155 mbit backbone, pop mailboxes, e-mail forwarding, e-mailing aliasing, auto responder, front page support, unlimited FTP access, java chat, hotmetal/miva script, shopping cart, secure transactions signio support, cybercash support and macromedia flash. The foregoing will allow us to make retail sales of salon products, promote our products in an attractive fashion, and communicate with our customers on-line. The website is intended to be a destination site for the beauty supply industry. We intend to source out a large network of suppliers all related to the hair/beauty/anti-aging business so that salon owners and purchasing agents will be able to buy all of their products from our website. The site will offer a large array of products and by becoming a one-stop shopping destination will significantly enhance the efficiency of the purchasing process simultaneously reducing the time and cost of finding reasonably priced salon products and supplies. We intend to continually source out and negotiate strategic relationships with individual suppliers and manufacturers to offer their products on our website. We intend to negotiate discounted pricing from the manufacturers in exchange for offering them access to the extensive database of salon owners and purchasing agents that we intend to develop and main tain through our extensive marketing program. We also believe that the lack of financial security on the Internet is hindering economic activity thereon. To ensure the security of transactions occurring over the Internet, U.S. federal regulations require that any computer software used within the United States contain a 128-bit encoding encryption, while any computer software exported to a foreign country contain a 40-bit encoding encryption. There is uncertainty as to whether the 128-bit encoding encryption required by the U.S. is sufficient security for transactions occurring over the Internet. Accordingly, there is a danger that any financial (credit card) transaction via the Internet will not be a secure transaction. Accordingly, risks such as the loss of data or loss of service on the Internet from technical failure or criminal acts are now being considered in the system specifications and in the security precautions in the development of the webs ite. There is no assurance that such security precautions will be successful. Other than investigating potential technologies in support of our business purpose, we have had no material business operations since inception in February 2008. At present, we have yet to acquire or develop the necessary technology assets in support of our business purpose to become a Internet-based retailer focused on the distribution of salon products. The Internet is a world-wide medium of interconnected electronic and/or computer networks. Individuals and companies have recently recognized that the communication capabilities of the Internet provide a medium for not only the promotion and communication of ideas and concepts, but also for the presentation and sale of information, goods and services. -22- Convenient Shopping Experience. Our online store will provide customers with an easy-to-use Web site. The website will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week and will be reached from the shopper's home or office. Our online store will enable us to deliver a broad selection of products to customers in rural or other locations that do not have convenient access to physical stores. We also intend to make the shopping experience convenient by categorizing our products into easy-to-shop departments. These include hair care products; hair color products and nail products. Customer Service . We intend to provide a customer service department via email where consumers can resolve order and product questions. Furthermore, we will insure consumer satisfaction by offering a money back guarantee. Online Retail Store We intend to design our Internet store to be a place for individual consumers to purchase salon products. Shopping at our Online Store Our online store will be located at www.cybersupplyinc.com We believe that the sale of salon products on the Internet can offer attractive benefits to consumers. These include enhanced selection, convenience, quality, ease-of-use, depth of content and information, and competitive pricing. Key features of our online store will include: Browsing Our online store will offer consumers several subject areas and special features arranged in a simple, easy-to-use format intended to enhance product selection. By clicking on a category name, the consumer will move directly to the home page of the desired category and can view promotions and featured products. Selecting a Product and Checking Out To purchase products, consumers will simply click on the "add to cart" button to add products to their virtual shopping cart. Consumers will be able to add and subtract products from their shopping cart as they browse around our online store prior to making a final purchase decision, just as in a physical store. To execute orders, consumers click on the "checkout" button and, depending upon whether the consumer has previously shopped at our online store, are prompted to supply shipping details online. We will also offer consumers a variety of wrapping and shipping options during the checkout process. Prior to finalizing an order by clicking the "submit" button, consumers will be shown their total charges along with the various options chosen at which point consumers still have the ability to change their order or cancel it entirely. -23- Paying To pay for orders, a consumer must use a credit card, which is authorized during the checkout process. Charges are assessed against the card when the order is placed. Our online store will use a security technology that works with the most common Internet browsers and makes it virtually impossible for unauthorized parties to read information sent by our consumers. We offer our customers a full refund for any reason if the customer returns the purchased item within thirty days from the date of sale in the same condition it was sold to the customer. After thirty days, we will not refund any money to a customer. Source of Products We intend to purchase salon products directly from the manufacturer/supplier based upon orders we have already received from customers. A portion of the purchase price, between 40% and 70%, depending on the prices we negotiate with the manufacturer, is used to acquire the product from the manufacturer, such as Revlon. Mark-ups on new products range from 15% to 200%. The product will be shipped directly from the manufacturer to the customer, thereby eliminating the need for storage space or packaging facilities. Revenue We intend to generate revenue from four sources on the website: 1. Revenues will be generated from the direct sale of products to customers. We would order products on behalf of our customers directly from our suppliers at the time of the order being received from a customer and the products would be shipped directly to the customer. That way we avoid having to carry any inventory that can be costly and become obsolete. We would earn revenue based on the difference between our negotiated price for the product with our suppliers and the price that the customer pays; 2. Revenues will be generated by fees received for sales that originate from our website and are linked to those manufacturers that we will negotiate relationships with. Our customers would link to the manufacturers website directly from our site and we would be paid a fee for directing the traffic that result in sales; 3. We plan to offer banner advertising on our website for new manufacturers hoping to launch new products; 4. Finally, we plan to earn revenues for special promotions to enable manufacturers to launch new products - we would sell premium shelf space on our website. We intend to develop and maintain a database of all current salon owners, students and apprentices who may become salon owners or purchasing agents listing their specific wants and needs. -24- We intend to develop and launch an advertising campaign to introduce our website to potential customers. Competition The electronic commerce market is intensely competitive. The market for information resources is more mature but also intensely competitive. We expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. Competitors include companies with substantial customer bases in the computer and other technical fields. There can be no assurance that we can maintain a competitive position against current or future competitors, particularly those with greater financial, marketing, service, support, technical and other resources. Our failure to maintain a competitive position within the market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Salonhair.net offers the same services as us. Upon initiating our website operations, we will be competing with the foregoing, in addition to non-Internet cosmetic and beauty product sales. The beauty supply industry is fragmented and regionalized. Our competitive position within the industry is negligible in light of the fact that we have not started our operations. Older, well established cosmetic distributors with records of success will attract qualified clients away from us. Since we have not started operations, we cannot compete with them on the basis of reputation. We do expect to compete with them on the basis of price and services. We intend to be able to attract and retain customers by offering a breadth of product selection through our relationships with major manufacturers and on the cutting edge newcomers to the industry. We will offer attractive, competitive pricing and will be responsive to all our customers needs. We intend to offer the manufacturers access to our extensive database of salon owners, apprentices and purchasing agents that we will develop through our extens ive marketing and advertising campaign. Marketing We intend to market our website in the United States and in Canada through traditional sources such as trade magazines, conventions and conferences, newspapers advertising, billboards, telephone directories and flyers/mailers. We intend to target purchasers of salon products such as salon owners, operators and purchasing agents. We may utilize inbound links that connect directly to our website from other sites. Potential customers can simply click on these links to become connected to our website from search engines and community and affinity sites. Insurance We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us which could cause us to cease operations. -25- Employees; Identification of Certain Significant Employees. We are a development stage company and currently have no employees, other than our sole officer and director. We intend to hire additional employees on an as needed basis. Offices Our principal executive office is located at 151-1201 LaRose Ave., Toronto, Ontario, Canada M9P 1B3. Our telephone number is (866) 536-2336 and our registered agent for service of process is the National Registered Agents Inc. of NV, located at 1000 East William Street, Suite 204, Carson City, Nevada 89701. Our office is located in the home of our president, Maria Shostak. We use approximately 100 square feet of space in her home on a rent free basis. Government Regulation We are not currently subject to direct federal, state or local regulation other than regulations applicable to businesses generally or directly applicable to electronic commerce. However, the Internet is increasingly popular. As a result, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security. Furthermore, the growth of electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws. Several states have proposed legislation to limit the uses of personal user information gathered online or require online services to establish privacy policies. The Federal Trade Commission has also initiated action against at least one online service regarding the m anner in which personal information is collected from users and provided to third parties. We will not provide personal information regarding our users to third parties. However, the adoption of such consumer protection laws could create uncertainty in Web usage and reduce the demand for our products. We not certain how business may be affected by the application of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights, encryption and other intellectual property issues, taxation, libel, obscenity and export or import matters. The vast majority of such laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet. As a result, they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Changes in laws intended to address such issues could create uncertainty in the Internet market place. Such uncertainty could reduce demand for services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs. In addition, because our products are available over the Internet in multiple states and foreign countries, other jurisdictions may claim that we are required to qualify to do business in each such state or foreign country. We are qualified to do business only in Nevada. Our failure to qualify in a jurisdiction where it is required to do so could subject it to taxes and penalties. It could also hamper our ability to enforce contracts in such jurisdictions. The application of laws or regulations from jurisdictions whose laws currently apply to our business could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. -26- MANAGEMENT Officers and Directors Our sole director will serve until her successor is elected and qualified. Our sole officer is elected by the board of directors to a term of one (1) year and serves until her successor is duly elected and qualified, or until she is removed from office. The board of directors has no nominating, auditing or compensation committees. The name, address, age and position of our present officers and directors are set forth below: Name and Address Age Position(s) Maria Shostak 36 president, principal executive officer, secretary, 151-1201 LaRose Ave. treasurer, principal financial officer, principal Toronto, Ontario accounting officer and sole member of the board of Canada M9P 1B3 directors. The person named above has held her offices/positions since inception of our company and are expected to hold her offices/positions until the next annual meeting of our stockholders. Background of officers and directors Since our inception on February 12, 2008, Maria Shostak has been our president, principal executive officer, secretary, treasurer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and sole member of the board of directors. Since March, 1998, Ms. Shostak has been an officer manager for Dorset Dental located in Scarborough, Ontario, Canada. During the past five years, Ms. Shostak has not been the subject of the following events: 1. Any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which Ms. Shostak was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time. 2. Any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding. 3. An order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, or any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting Ms. Shostaks involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities. 4. Found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Future Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended or vacated. -27- Audit Committee Financial Expert We do not have an audit committee financial expert. We do not have an audit committee financial expert because we believe the cost related to retaining a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Further, because we have no operations, at the present time, we believe the services of a financial expert are not warranted. Conflicts of Interest The only conflict that we foresee is that our sole officer and director will devote time to projects that do not involve us. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The following table sets forth the compensation paid by us for the last three fiscal years ending February 29, 2008 for each or our officers. This information includes the dollar value of base salaries, bonus awards and number of stock options granted, and certain other compensation, if any.

Indemnification Under our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the corporation, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any proceeding, including a lawsuit, because of her/his position, if she/he acted in good faith and in a manner she/he reasonably believed to be in our best interest. We may advance expenses incurred in defending a proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in a proceeding as to which he is to be indemnified, we must indemnify her/him against all expenses incurred, including attorney's fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada. Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Nevada law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. -29- PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS The following table sets forth, as of the date of this prospectus, the total number of shares owned beneficially by our directors, officers and key employees, individually and as a group, and the present owners of 5% or more of our total outstanding shares. The table also reflects what their ownership will be assuming completion of the sale of all shares in this offering . The stockholders listed below have direct ownership of their shares and possesses sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the shares. Number of Shares Percentage of Percentage of After Offering Ownership After Number of Ownership Assuming all of the Offering Name and Address Shares Before Before the the Shares are Assuming all of the Beneficial Owner [1] the Offering Offering Sold Shares are Sold Maria Shostak 5,000,000 100 % 5,000,000 71.42 % 151-1201 LaRose Ave. Toronto, Ontario Canada M9B 1B3 [1] The person named above may be deemed to be a "parent" and "promoter" of our company, within the meaning of such terms under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by virtue of her/his/its direct and indirect stock holdings. Ms. Shostak is the only "promoter" of our company. Future sales by existing stockholders A total of 5,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to our sole officer and director, all of which are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 of the Rules and Regulations of the SEC promulgated under the Securities Act. Under Rule 144, the shares can be publicly sold by affiliates, subject to volume restrictions and restrictions on the manner of sale, commencing six months after their acquisition, provided the Company was not a shell company when the shares were issued or prior thereto. A shell company is a corporation with no or nominal assets or its assets consist solely of cash and no or nominal operations. We believe we are not a shell at this time since we have more than nominal operations. Shares purchased in this offering, will be immediately resalable. The resale of shares could have a depressive effect on the market price should a market develop for our common stock. There is no assurance a market will ever develop for our common stock. There is no public trading market for our common stock. There are no outstanding options or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into, our common stock. There is one holder of record for our common stock. The record holder is our sole officer and director who owns 5,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock. -30- DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES Common Stock Our authorized capital stock consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share. The holders of our common stock: * have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available if and when declared by our board of directors; * are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs; * do not have preemptive, subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights; and * are entitled to one non-cumulative vote per share on all matters on which stockholders may vote. All shares of common stock now outstanding are fully paid for and non-assessable and all shares of common stock that are the subject of this offering, when issued, will be fully paid for and non-assessable. We refer you to our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and the applicable statutes of the State of Nevada for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of our securities. Non-cumulative voting Holders of shares of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares, voting for the election of directors, can elect all of the directors to be elected, if they so choose, and, in that event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any of our directors. After this offering is completed, assuming the sale of all of the shares of common stock, Ms. Shostak, our sole officer and directors, will own approximately 71.42% of our outstanding shares. Cash dividends As of the date of this prospectus, we have not paid any cash dividends to stockholders. The declaration of any future cash dividend will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial position, our general economic conditions, and other pertinent conditions. It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in our business operations. Anti-takeover provisions There are no Nevada anti-takeover provisions that may have the affect of delaying or preventing a change in control. -31- Reports After we complete this offering, we will not be required to furnish you with an annual report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our fiscal year end is February 28. We will provide audited financial statements to our stockholders on an annual basis; the statements will be audited by a firm of Independent Public Accountants. Our financial statements from inception to February 29, 2008 (audited), immediately follow: REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM F -1 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance Sheet F -2 Statement of Expenses F -3 Statement of Stockholders' Deficit F -4 Statement of Cash Flows F -5 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F -6 -33- REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board Directors Cyber Supply, Inc. (a development stage company) Toronto, Ontario We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Cyber Supply Inc. as of February 29, 2008 and the related statements of expenses, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the period from February 12, 2008 (inception) to February 29, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of Cyber Supply's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. Cyber Supply is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Cyber Supplys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates m ade by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cyber Supply as of February 29, 2008 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the period from February 12, 2008 (inception) to February 29, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Cyber Supply will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, Cyber Supply has a working capital deficiency, has not generated revenues and has accumulated losses since inception, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

F-5 -38- Cyber Supply Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to the Financial Statements February 29, 2008 NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Business. Cyber Supply Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on February 12, 2008 for the purpose of providing beauty products through an online distribution service. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Earnings Per Share. The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an "as if converted" basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the period ended February 29, 2008, there were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding. Revenue recognition. Cyber recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. This typically occurs when the product is shipped. As of February 29, 2008, Cyber Supply had no revenues. Cash and Cash Equivalents. For purposes of the statement of cash flows, Cyber Supply considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Income Taxes. Cyber recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. Cyber provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. Cyber Supply does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on their results of operations, financial position or cash flow. F-6 -39- Cyber Supply Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to the Financial Statements February 29, 2008 NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies Cyber will continue to meet its obligations and continue its operations for the next fiscal year. Realization value may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should Cyber be unable to continue as a going concern. As at February 29, 2008, Cyber has a working capital deficiency, has not generated revenues and has accumulated losses of $15,010 since inception. The continuation of Cyber as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of Cyber Supply to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regardin g Cybers ability to continue as a going concern. NOTE 3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS On February 29, 2008, Cyber owed its president and director $24,990 for advances made to Cyber. The total amount is unsecured, non interest bearing, and has no specific terms for repayment. Ms. Shostak allows us to use approximately 100 square feet of her home for our operations on a rent free basis. NOTE 4. COMMON STOCK On February 12, 2008, Cyber issued 5,000,000 common shares to its president at $0.00001 per share for $50. NOTE 5. INCOME TAXES Cyber uses the liability method, where deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes. Since inception, Cyber incurred net losses and, therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved. The cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is $15,010 at February 29, 2008, and will expire in the year 2028. At February 29, 2008, deferred tax assets consisted of the following: Deferred tax assets $ 2,250 Less: valuation allowance (2,250 ) Net deferred tax asset $ - F -7 -40- PART II.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in the volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and (c) include any additional or changed material information with respect to the plan of distribution. (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post- effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered herein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) To provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriter to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser. (5) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of a registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in the form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. II-3 (6) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new Registration Statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

Provided however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any s tatement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.
