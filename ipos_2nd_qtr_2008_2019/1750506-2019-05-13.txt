DISTRIBUTION OF 24,111,183 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK This Prospectus is being furnished to you as a shareholder of Cleartronic Inc. (Cleartronic) in connection with the planned distribution (the Spin-Off or the Distribution) by Cleartronic to its shareholders owning common stock, Series C preferred stock and Series D preferred stock of all the shares of common stock of VoiceInterop, Inc. (VoiceInterop or the VoiceInterop) held by Cleartronic immediately prior to the Spin-Off. Immediately after the time of the Spin-Off, Cleartronic shareholders will hold 72% of the outstanding shares of common stock of VoiceInterop. In addition, this Prospectus covers the resale of 6,650,000 shares (Resale Shares) issued to six (6) selling shareholders (Selling Shareholders) described more fully herein. At the time of the Spin Off, Cleartronic is distributing all shares of VoiceInterops common stock held by it to its shareholders owning common stock, Class C preferred stock and Class D preferred stock. Each shareholder of Cleartronic common stock on _______ (the Record Date) will receive .075 shares of VoiceInterops common stock for each one share of Cleartronic common stock (1,000 shares of Cleartronic common stock will receive 75 shares of VoiceInterop common stock). Shareholders owning Series C preferred stock and Series D preferred stock on the Record Date will receive .375 shares of VoiceInterops common stock for one share of Series C preferred stock or Series D preferred stock (1,000 shares of Cleartronic Series C or Series D Preferred Stock will receive 375 shares of VoiceInterop common stock). In case of anyone entitled to receive a fractional share, the number of shares will be rounded up. The Distribution will be made in book-entry form by the distribution agent. The Spin-Off will be effective as of 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on ______, (the Distribution Date). Immediately after the Spin-Off, then VoiceInterop will be an independent publicly traded company. The Selling Shareholders will receive all of the proceeds from the sale of the Resale Shares and we will receive none of those proceeds. The Selling Shareholders intent on offering the Resale Shares for resale at an initial price of $0.25 per share until and unless are shares are traded on a national securities exchange or quoted on the OTCBB or OTCQB markets (which we provide no assurance will be accomplished) and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. Cleartronic shareholders are not required to vote on or take any other action in connection with the Spin-Off. We are not asking you for a proxy, and we request that you do not send us a proxy. Cleartronic shareholders will not be required to pay any consideration for the common stock they receive in the Spin-Off, and they will not be required to surrender or exchange their shares of Cleartronics common stock or take any other action in connection with the Spin-Off. There is currently no public market for our common stock. While we intend to seek quotation of our shares on the Over-the-Counter Pink Sheets, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so. As a result of these factors, an investment in our common stock is not suitable for investors who require short or medium- term liquidity. VoiceInterop is an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act) and applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules and are, therefore, currently eligible for reduced public company reporting requirements. In reviewing this Prospectus, you should carefully consider the matters described in the section titled Risk Factors beginning on page __ of this Prospectus. -iii- NEITHER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED THESE SECURITIES OR DETERMINED IF THIS PROSPECTUS IS TRUTHFUL OR COMPLETE.

The summary does not contain all the information you should consider before investing in our securities. You should read the entire Prospectus, including Risk Factors: and the financial statements and related notes before making an investment decision. About Us VoiceInterop, Inc. (the VoiceInterop, we or us) is a Florida corporation located at 8000 Federal Highway, Suite 102, Boca Raton, Florida. VoiceInterop is currently a majority-owned subsidiary of Cleatronic, Inc. We sell hardware and software solutions for unified group communications, which are deployed by commercial enterprises, as well as government emergency responders, airports and educational institutions. VoiceInterop will continue to focus on our leading product, the airport crash phone system, named the Command Phone. While not limited to airports, its primary function is group calling to a fixed set of endpoints (phones, speakers, etc.) so that everybody in the relevant community receives the same message simultaneously. As of May 10, 2019, we have designed, built and installed over 21 unified group communications solutions. We generate revenues from the design, construction and installation of group communication systems. We also generate revenues from maintenance and support contracts, once a unified group communications solution has been installed and tested. We generated $45,551 and $22,618 in revenues in the three month period ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We plan to increase our sales of our unified group communication solutions in fiscal 2019 and 2020 pursuant to our revised business plan. We plan to increase our sales and marketing program and believe that this will lead to increased sales. We would like to enter additional vertical sectors such as industrial campuses, utilities and educational organizations, which will require additional marketing dollars. These marketing funds would be used to advertise in vertical industry trade publications, direct and indirect sales activities, Constant Contact email campaigns, and industry association memberships and trade shows. These activities would be primarily focused on regional organizations to establish market share and shorten the sales cycle compared to large national opportunities. We will need to hire additional sales and marketing personnel. We are also considering acquiring other companies, either in the same industry or operating subsidiaries of public or private companies with the goal of manufacturing and selling products, services, and integrated systems to government agencies, business enterprises, and the general public. Relationship between Cleartronic and VoiceInterop We are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cleartronic, Inc. and were incorporated under the laws of the state of Florida on November 2007. After the Spin Off, VoiceInterop will be an independent public company, any relationship thereafter is limited to the terms of the Separation Agreement summarized below and Cleartronics continuing business relationship. For a more detailed description of these relationships, please see Relationship between Cleartronic and VoiceInterop Following the Spin Off. Summary of the Transactions Covered by this Registration Statement and Prospectus -3- This Prospectus and Registration Statement, of which it is part, cover two separate transactions and issuances of shares of the Company: (i) the distribution of 17,461,183 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Cleartronic as a result of a Spin-Off Transaction and (ii) the resale of an aggregate of 650,000 shares of our common stock and 6,000,000 shares by an officer and director. The Spin-Off See The Spin Off, beginning on page __ for a more detailed description of the matters described below. Reasons for the spin-off See  The Spin-Off  describing in detail the spin-off , spin-off ratio, results of the spin-off, reason for the Prospectus and related considerations. No shareholder approval of the spin-off is required, and none is being sought. Neither Cleartronic nor VoiceInterop are asking you for a proxy. Distributing Company Cleartronic, Inc., a Florida corporation, which holds 100% of our issued and outstanding common stock prior to the Distribution. After the Distribution, Cleartronic will not own any shares of our common stock. Securities to be Distributed All of the shares of our common stock owned by Cleartronic, which will be 72% of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Distribution. Based on the 207,232,524 shares of Cleartronics common stock, 4,433,375 shares of Series C preferred stock and 670,904 shares of Series D preferred stock outstanding, respectively, as of the close of business on May 10, 2019 and applying the Spin-Off Ratios described below approximately 17.46 million shares of our common stock will be distributed. The actual number of shares of our common stock distributed will depend on the number of shares of Cleartronic common stock outstanding on the Record Date. Record Date Distribution Date The Record Date will be ten (10) business days after our registration statement is declared effective by the SEC. The Distribution Date will be ten (10) days after the Record Date. Spin-off ratio Holders of record of Cleartronic common stock at the close of business on the Record Date will receive .075 shares of VoiceInterops common stock for each one share of Cleartronic common stock (1,000 shares of Cleartronic common stock will receive 75 shares of VoiceInterop common stock). Holders of records of Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock on the Record Date will receive .375 shares of VoiceInterops common stock for each one share of Series C preferred stock or Series D Preferred stock (1,000 shares of Cleartronic Series C or Series D Preferred Stock will receive 375 shares of VoiceInterops common stock). In case of anyone entitled to receive a fractional share, the number of shares will be rounded up The Spin-Off On the Distribution Date, Cleartronic will release shares of VoiceInterops common stock to the Transfer Agent to distribute to Cleartronics shareholders. Cleartronic will distribute our shares in book-entry form and thus we will not issue any physical stock certificates. You will not be required to make any payment, surrender or exchange of your shares of Cleartronic common stock or take any other action to receive your shares of VoiceInterops common stock. A book-entry account statement reflecting your ownership of whole shares of our common stock will be mailed to you, or your brokerage account will be credited the shares, within 30 days of the date of the Distribution. Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences The value of VoiceInterop shares received from the spin-off is taxable to the recipient as a dividend. -4- Secondary Market There is a limited public market for Cleartronics common stock and trades are reported by the OTC Markets Pink, however, there is currently no public market for VoiceInterops common stock. VoiceInterop intends to apply to qualify its common stock for quotation on the OTC Markets Pink or other secondary market for which it qualifies under a symbol yet to be determined. We have not applied to register the shares in any state. An exemption from registration will be relied upon in the states where the shares are distributed and may only be traded in such jurisdictions after compliance with applicable securities laws. There can be no assurances that the shares will be eligible for sale or resale in such jurisdictions. We may apply to register the shares in several states for secondary trading; however we are under no requirement to do so. Rather, we anticipate that we will distribute restricted VoiceInterop shares to holders of Cleartronic common stock that reside in states which do not provide for an exemption from registration for this distribution. Relationship between Cleartronic and VoiceInterop After the Spin Off Cleartronic and the VoiceInterop have entered into a Separation Agreement in connection with the Spin-Off. The agreement provides for the completion of the Spin-Off and will govern the relationship between Cleartronic and the VoiceInterop after the Spin-Off. See the section entitled Relationship between Cleartronic and the VoiceInterop following the Spin-Off. Resale of Shares by Selling Shareholders Overview This Prospectus relates to the resale of up to 6,650,000 shares of our common stock by six (6) shareholders. -5- Dividend policy Following the Distribution, neither Cleartronic nor VoiceInterop anticipate paying any dividends on their respective common stock in the foreseeable future.

Its address is 16540 Pointe Village Drive, Lutz, FL 33558. Its telephone number is (813) 235-4490. Risk factors See the section entitled Risk Factors beginning on page 4 for a discussion of some of the factors you should carefully consider in connection with this spin-off, including detailed risks related respectively to the spin-off proper, our common stock and our business. We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jobs Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: (i) a requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MDA, (ii) exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth companys internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (iii) reduced disclosure about the emerging growth companys executive compensation and (iv) no non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. PART I. INFORMATION REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider all of the information in this Prospectus and each of the risks described below, which we believe are the principal risks that we face. Some of these risks relate principally to our business, while others relate principally to the separation and distribution or to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Risks Relating to the Spin-Off We have no operating history as a separate public company, and our historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of our future prospects. The historical information in this Prospectus refers to our business as operated by and integrated with Cleartronic. Our historical financial information included in this Prospectus is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cleartronic. Therefore, the historical information included in this Prospectus does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company or those that we will achieve in the future, primarily as a result of the following factors. -6- Prior to the separation date, we have operated as a subsidiary of Cleartronic, rather than as a separate company. Cleartronic performed various corporate functions for us and/or our assets, including tax administration, cash management, accounting, information services, human resources, ethics and compliance programs, investor and public relations, certain governance functions (including internal audit) and external reporting. Our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Cleartronic for these and similar functions. These allocations may be less than the comparable expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company. Accordingly, our historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of our future prospects. We may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from our Spin-Off from Cleartronic. By separating from Cleartronic, there is a risk that we will not achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Spin-Off or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. We maybe more susceptible to market fluctuations, liquidity challenges, increased costs, potential disruptions in our business, increased public scrutiny and other adverse events than we would have been if we were still a part of Cleartronic. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation, or if such benefits are delayed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We cannot be certain that our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Any failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have e a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Risks Related to Our Operations Because of our limited capital, unless we obtain substantial additional capital we may not have sufficient capital to continue as a going concern. As of May 10, 2019, we have $11,006 in cash on hand. The costs to operate our current business are approximately $9,000 per month. In order for us to cover our monthly operating expenses, we would have to generate revenues of approximately $18,000 per month. Accordingly, in the absence of revenues, we will need to secure $9,000 in equity or debt capital each month to cover our overhead expenses. In order to remain in business for one year without any revenues we would need to secure $108,000 in equity or debt capital. If we are unsuccessful in securing sufficient capital or revenues, we may have to cease operations. We need additional capital in the future to finance our planned growth, which we may not be able to raise or it may only be available on terms unfavorable to us or our shareholders, which may result in our inability to fund our working capital requirements and harm our operational results. We have and expect to continue to have substantial capital expenditure and working capital needs. We do not now have funds sufficient to fund our operations at their current level for the next 12 months. We need to raise additional cash to fund our operations and implement our business plan. We are maintaining an on-going effort to locate sources of additional funding, without which we will not be able to remain a viable entity. If we are able to obtain the financing required to remain in business, -7- eventually achieving operating profits will require substantially increasing revenues or drastically reducing expenses from their current levels or both. If we are able to obtain the required financing to remain in business, future operating results depend upon a number of factors that are outside of our control. The expected operating losses, coupled with a lack of liquidity, raise a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our then-current shareholders would be reduced, and these newly issued securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders. At this stage of our business operations, investors may lose their entire investment. Because of the factors described above, and given the nature of our business and our changing business focus, we may not be able to execute our business plan and may be forced to cease operations, which could result in the loss by investors of their entire investment in our common stock. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of our equity securities, the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be reduced, we may undergo a change in control and shareholders may experience dilution which could substantially diminish the value of their common stock. One of the factors which generally affects the market price of publicly traded equity securities is the number of shares outstanding in relationship to assets, net worth, earnings or anticipated earnings and other financial items. If a public market is sustained for our shares, a material amount of dilution can be expected to cause the market price of our shares to decline. Furthermore, the public perception of future dilution can have the same effect even if the actual dilution does not occur. Risks related to the Unified Communications Industry We could face exposure to substantial liabilities if our unified group communications solutions did not work properly due to negligence or malfeasance. We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to liability arising from the use of our unified group communications solutions by airports or other emergency responders. For example, if due to networking or system error which was directly attributed to our negligence or malfeasance and the crash phone system did not work as expected, we could be exposed to significant liability. We are not certain that any product liability coverage we may obtain will be adequate to protect against claims which may be asserted against us by our customers or others. We do not now have any product liability insurance and there can be no assurance that even if such insurance becomes available to us at reasonable rates, we will have the financial resources to purchase the insurance. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose or fail to gain market share and revenue. The unified group communications industry is extremely competitive. Over the past year, the number of companies entering our industry have increased dramatically. Competitive pricing pressures can negatively impact profit margins, if any. Competitors include Cisco Systems, Inc., Tyco Electronics Ltd., Catalyst Communications Technologies, Inc., Telex, Inc., Federal Signal Corporation and Mutual-link, Inc. as well as Twisted Pair Solutions, Inc. and its other resellers and licensees. These and other potential competitors are generally large and well capitalized and have substantially more experience than we do in our industry. We may also face intense competition from traditional telephone companies, wireless companies, cable companies and alternative voice communication providers. We expect to face competition from cable companies which have added or are planning to add unified group communications or voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services to their existing product lines. Our competitors financial resources may allow them to offer services at prices below cost or without charge in order to maintain and gain market share or otherwise improve their competitive positions. Our competitors also could use their greater financial resources to offer more attractive service packages that include on-site installation and more robust customer service. Any of the competitive factors could make it more difficult or impossible for us to attract and retain customers, cause us to lower our prices in order to compete and reduce our market share and revenues. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our revenues or achieve profitability. -8- Because the market for unified group communication services is likely to be characterized by rapid technological change, if we do not respond rapidly to technological changes or to changes in industry standards, our services could become obsolete. We may be unable to respond quickly or effectively to new developments because of our limited capital or otherwise. We may experience difficulties with the development of software to be utilized as part of our business, hardware procurement or marketing strategies that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or marketing of new services and enhancements. The introduction of new services by our competitors, the market acceptance of services based on new or alternative technologies or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future services obsolete. If the standards adopted are different from those that we have chosen to support, market acceptance of our services, if any, may be significantly reduced or delayed. If our services or software become technologically obsolete, we may be unable to sell our products in the marketplace and generate revenues. If we are not able to obtain necessary licenses of third-party technology at acceptable prices, or at all, our products and services could become obsolete. From time to time, we may be required to license technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements. Third-party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. The inability to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses or to obtain any new third-party licenses to develop new products, services and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost, and delay or prevent us from offering these products, services or enhancements, any of which could seriously harm the competitiveness of our services. Decreasing unified group communication services prices may cause us to lower our prices to remain competitive, which could, among other things, postpone or prevent our future profitability. Users who select our service offerings may switch to other service providers who may provide the same or similar services at lower prices, and we may be unable to use our price as a distinguishing feature to attract new customers in the future. Such competition or continued price decreases may require us to lower our prices to remain competitive, may result in reduced revenue and a loss of customers and may postpone or prevent our future profitability, if any. We may not be able to maintain adequate customer care which could adversely affect our ability to grow and cause our financial results to be negatively impacted. Good customer care is important to acquiring and retaining customers. We may not be able to maintain or expand our customer care operations quickly enough to meet the needs of our customer base, in which case the quality of our customer care will suffer. If we are unable to hire, train and retain sufficient personnel to provide adequate customer care, we may fail to retain existing customers, experience slower or no growth and increased costs, any of which would cause us to be negatively impacted. If we experience growth, there will be substantial demands on our management and operations. If we are not able to hire, train and retain the necessary personnel, or if these operational and reporting improvements are not implemented successfully, we may have to make significant additional expenditures and further draw management attention away from running our business to address these issues. The quality of our services could suffer, which could negatively affect our operating results and financial position. Because much of our potential success and potential value may lie in our use of our Command Phone, if we fail to protect it, our business could be materially adversely effected. We anticipate that our ability to compete effectively will be dependent, in substantial part, upon the maintenance and protection of our Command Phone. We have no patents. We intend to rely on trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our rights to the technology. We intend, in the future, to enter into confidentiality and/or license agreements in an effort to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use the technology without authorization. Policing unauthorized use of -9- the technology is difficult. The steps we take may not prevent misappropriation of the technology upon which we rely. In addition, effective protection may be unavailable or limited in many jurisdictions outside the United States. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or protect our rights or to determine the validity and scope of the rights of others. Even if we were to acquire the financial resources to pursue litigation, it could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert resources away from our daily business, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business. We may be subject to damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation. Intellectual property litigation could be time-consuming and expensive, divert attention and resources away from our daily business, impede or prevent delivery of our products and services; and may require us to pay significant royalties, licensing fees and damages. Parties making claims of infringement may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide our services and could cause us to pay substantial damages. In the event of a successful claim of infringement, we may need to obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may not be available at a reasonable cost, if at all. The defense of any lawsuit could result in time-consuming and expensive litigation, regardless of the merits of such claims, and could also result in damages, license fees, royalty payments and restrictions on our ability to provide our services, any of which could harm our business. The use of our service will require our customers to have an operative broadband connection, and if the adoption of broadband service does not progress as we expect or if it increases in price, the market for our services may not grow and we may not be able to grow our business and increase our revenue. If the adoption of broadband service does not continue to grow, the market for our services may not grow. As a result, we may not be able to increase our revenue and become profitable. Future disruptive new technologies could have a negative effect on our businesses. VoIP technology, which our business is based upon, did not exist and was not commercially viable until relatively recently. VoIP technology is having a disruptive effect on traditional telephone companies, whose businesses are based on other technologies. We also are subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. If new technologies develop that are able to better deliver competing voice or data services or to deliver them at lower prices or more conveniently, it would have a material adverse effect on us. Risks related to our Business We are dependent on a small number of individuals, and if we lose the services of any person upon whom we are dependent, we will be adversely affected. Our future success depends to a considerable degree on the vision, skills, experience and effort of our management and certain of our consultants. We do not have an employment agreement with any of our employees, including our management, nor do we have long-term agreements with any of our consultants. If we lose the services of any of them, or if members of our management do not work well together, it would have an adverse effect on our business. The unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the market price, if any, of our common stock. We expect that our revenues, if any, and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. The primary factors that may affect our revenues and operating results include the following: · fluctuation in demand for our products and services; · the length and variability of the sales cycle for our services; -10- · new product introductions and service enhancements by our competitors; · the timing of revenue recognition and amount of deferred revenues; · changes in our pricing policies, the pricing policies of our competitors and the prices of the vendors we buy services from; · costs related to acquisitions of complementary services, technologies or businesses; and general economic and political conditions, as well as those specific to the telecommunications, networking and related industries. Because of the amount of our common stock owned by three persons, it is unlikely that any other holder of common stock will be able to affect our management or direction. Following the Distribution and the issue of an aggregate of 6 million shares of common stock, our directors and executive officers will hold a total of approximately 6 million shares, or approximately 24.88% of the common stock outstanding as of the date of this Prospectus. Accordingly, if these shareholders act together as a group, they would likely be able to control the outcome of shareholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of significant corporate transactions. The existence of ownership concentrated in a few persons may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in management or voting control. Furthermore, the interests of our controlling shareholders could conflict with those of our other shareholders. Because our common stock is considered to be a penny stock, our shareholders ability to sell their shares in a public market may be significantly impaired by the Securities and Exchange Commissions penny stock rules. The penny stock rules require a market-maker, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The market-maker also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock the broker-dealer make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that is or becomes subject to the penny stock rules. In addition the burdens imposed upon market-makers by the penny stock rules may discourage market-makers from effecting transactions in our common stock, which could severely limit its liquidity. If we are unable to retain the services of Mr. Reid, or if we are unable to successfully recruit qualified managerial and sales personnel having experience in business, we may not be able to continue our operations. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of Larry Reid, our Chief Executive Officer. Loss of the services of Mr. Reid could have a material adverse effect on our growth, revenues, and prospective business. In order to successfully implement and manage our business plan, we will be dependent upon (among other things) successfully recruiting qualified managerial and sales personnel having experience in business. Competition for qualified individuals is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find, attract and retain existing employees or that we will be able to find, attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. Our current management resources may not be sufficient for the future, and we have no assurance that we can attract additional qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that the current level of management is sufficient to perform all responsibilities necessary or beneficial for management to perform. Our success in attracting additional qualified personnel will depend on many factors, including our ability to provide them with competitive compensation arrangements, equity participation and other benefits. There is no assurance that (if we need to) we will be successful in attracting highly qualified individuals in key management positions. -11- We may experience rapid growth, and in such case, we will need to manage this growth effectively. We believe that, given the right business opportunities, we may expand our operations rapidly and significantly. If rapid growth were to occur, it could place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. To manage any significant growth of our operations, we will be required to undertake the following successfully: (i) manage relationships with various strategic partners and other third parties; (ii) hire and retain skilled personnel necessary to support our business; (iii) train and manage a growing employee base; and (iv) continually develop our financial and information management systems. If we fail to make adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with this expansion or if our systems, procedures or controls are not adequate to support our operations, our business could be harmed. Our inability to manage growth effectively could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are an emerging growth company, and it is possible that the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. As an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make our financial statements not comparable with those of another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. Risks Related to our Common Stock There is no existing market for our common stock, and a trading market that will provide you with adequate liquidity may not develop for our common stock. In addition, once our common stock begins trading, the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely. There is currently no public market for our common stock. We intend to apply to list our common stock on the OTC Pink Sheets under a ticker symbol to be determined. However, an active trading market for our common stock may not develop as a result of the Spin-Off or may not be sustained in the future. -12- We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain all of our earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases. Our board of directors retains discretion to change this policy. THE OFFERING The Spin-Off Background Information On April 21, 2018, Cleartronic announced plans for the complete legal and structural separation of the VoiceInterop from Cleartronic. Cleartronic currently owns 100% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Cleartronic will distribute all of its outstanding shares of our common stock, to Cleartronics shareholders owning shares of its common stock, Series C preferred stock and Series D preferred stock on the Record Date pursuant to certain distribution ratios described herein. The shareholders owning Series A Prefered Stock and Series E Preferred Stock signed waiver letters on September 18, 2018 in which they agreed not to accept any distributions of shares of our common stock in the Spin Off. Following the Spin-Off, Cleartronic will not own any shares of our issued and outstanding common stock and we will operate independently from Cleartronic. No approval of Cleartronics shareholders is required in connection with the Spin-Off, and Cleartronics shareholders will not have any appraisal rights in connection with the Spin-Off. The Spin-Off is subject to the satisfaction, or the Cleartronics board of directors waiver, of a number of conditions. In addition, Cleartronic has the right not to complete the Spin-Off if, at any time, the Cleartronic Board determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the Spin-Off is not in the best interests of Cleartronic or its shareholders or is otherwise not advisable. For a more detailed description, see The Spin-OffConditions to the Spin-Off. Reasons for the Spin Off Cleartronic believed that the subsequent Spin-Off would enhance value for its shareholders and our shareholders by creating significant opportunities and benefits, including: · making VoiceInterop a publicly traded company. · segregating businesses that may be valued greater as separate public companies. We believe that by segregating Cleartronic and VoiceInterop, the AudioMate Gateway and unified communications group, respectively, will be better able to be valued independently, allowing for the potential of greater shareholder value. · allowing our management to focus its efforts on maximizing the value of its unified communications group. We believe that being a separate company without being under the umbrella of Cleartronic, will allow VoiceInterop to attract better management, business opportunities, capital, and value for our shareholders. · unlocking shareholder value by shareholders owning stock in two companies rather than one. We believe that segregating two businesses in different fields will allow investors to appropriately value each company and allow our shareholders to maximize their investment opportunities. The negative factor associated with the Spin-Off is the uncertainty of value and liquidity of our stock, presuming we are able to obtain listing on the OTC Markets Pink, of which there is no assurance. There is also no certainty that we will be able to raise the capital we need as a public company. -13- Manner of Effecting the Spin-Off Cleartronic will distribute to its shareholders owning its common stock .075 shares of VoiceInterops common stock for every one share of Cleartronic common stock outstanding as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date. (1,000 shares of Cleartronic common stock will receive 75 shares of VoiceInterop common stock). Cleartronic will distribute to its shareholders owning Series C or Series D Preferred Stock .375 shares of common stock of VoiceInterop for everyone share of Cleartronic Series C or Series D preferred stock outstanding as of 5:00 pm, New York City time on the Record Date (1,000 shares of Cleartronic Series C or Series D Preferred Stock will receive 375 shares of VoiceInterop common stock). In case of anyone entitled to receive a fractional share, the number of shares will be rounded up. The holders of Cleartronics Series A Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock have waived their rights to receive shares of VoiceInterops common stock in the Spin-Off. Prior to the Spin-Off, Cleartronic will deliver all of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock to ClearTrust, who will serve as the distribution agent in connection with the Distribution and as transfer agent and registrar for our common stock. If you own Cleartronic common stock, Series C preferred stock or Series D preferred stock as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date, the shares of our common stock that you are entitled to receive in the Distribution will be issued to your account as follows:  Registered shareholders . If you own your shares of Cleartronic common stock directly through Cleartronics transfer agent, ClearTrust, you are a registered shareholder. In this case, the distribution agent, ClearTrust, will credit the whole shares of our common stock you receive in the Spin-Off by way of direct registration in book-entry form to a new account with our transfer agent. Registration in book-entry form refers to a method of recording share ownership where no physical stock certificates are issued to shareholders, as is the case in the Spin-Off. You will be able to access information regarding your book-entry account holding our shares at ClearTrust. Commencing on or shortly after the Spin-Off Date, the distribution agent will mail to you an account statement that indicates the number of whole shares of our common stock that have been registered in book-entry form in your name. We expect it will take the distribution agent up to two weeks after the Spin-Off Date to complete the distribution of the shares of our common stock and mail statements of holding to all registered shareholders.   Street name  or beneficial shareholders . Most Cleartronic shareholders own their shares of Cleartronic common stock beneficially through a bank, broker or other nominee. In these cases, the bank, broker or other nominee holds the shares in street name and records your ownership on its books. If you own your shares of Cleartronic common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee, your bank, broker or other nominee will credit your account with the whole shares of our common stock that you receive in the Spin-Off on or shortly after the Distribution Date. We encourage you to contact your bank, broker or other nominee if you have any questions concerning the mechanics of having shares held in street name. If you sell any of your shares of Cleartronic common stock on or before the Spin-Off Date, the buyer of those shares may in some circumstances be entitled to receive the shares of our common stock to be distributed in respect of the Cleartronic shares you sold. See The Spin-OffTrading Prior to the Spin-Off Date for more information. We are not asking Cleartronic shareholders to take any action in connection with the Spin-Off. No approval of the holders of Cleartronic common stock is required for the Spin-Off. We are not asking you for a proxy and request that you not send us a proxy. We are also not asking you to make any payment or surrender or exchange any of your shares of Cleartronic common stock for shares of our common stock. The number of outstanding shares of Cleartronic common stock will not change as a result of the Spin-Off. Results of the Spin-Off After the Spin-Off, we will be an independent publicly-traded company. Immediately following the Spin-Off, we expect to have approximately 312 holders of shares of our common stock and approximately 24,111,183 shares of our common stock outstanding, based on the number of Cleartronic shareholders and shares of Cleartronic common stock outstanding as of May 10, 2019. The actual number of shares of our common stock Cleartronic will distribute in the Spin-Off will depend on the actual number -14- of shares of Cleartronic common stock outstanding on the Record Date, which will reflect any issuance of new shares or exercises of outstanding options on or prior to the Record Date. The Spin-Off will not affect the number of outstanding shares of Cleartronic common stock or any rights of Cleartronic shareholders, although we expect the trading price of shares of Cleartronic common stock immediately following the Distribution to be lower than immediately prior to the Distribution because the trading price of Cleartronic common stock will no longer reflect the value of the VoiceInterop. Furthermore, until the market has fully analyzed the value of Cleartronic without the VoiceInterop, the trading price of shares of Cleartronic common stock may fluctuate. Before our separation from Cleartronic, we intend to enter into a Separation Agreement with Cleartronic related to the Spin-Off. This agreement will govern the relationship between us and Cleartronic up to and after completion of the Spin-Off and allocate between us and Cleartronic various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations, including employee benefits, intellectual property and tax-related assets and liabilities. We describe these arrangements in greater detail under Certain Relationships and Related Party TransactionsAgreements with Cleartronic. Listing and Trading of our Common Stock There is currently no public market for our common stock. We intend to apply have our common stock authorized for quotation on the OTC Markets Pink or other secondary market, depending on our qualifications at the time with a symbol to be selected by us. We cannot, however, ensure that we will be successful in doing so or that an active trading market will exist thereafter. We have not applied to register the shares in any state. An exemption from registration will be relied upon in the states where the shares are distributed and may only be traded in such jurisdictions after compliance with applicable securities laws. There can be no assurances that the shares will be eligible for sale or resale in such jurisdictions. We may apply to register the shares in several states for secondary trading; however we are under no requirement to do so. Neither we nor Cleartronic can assure you as to the trading price of Cleartronic common stock or our common stock after the Spin-Off, or as to whether the combined trading prices of our common stock and the Cleartronic common stock after the Spin-Off will be less than, equal to or greater than the trading prices of Cleartronic common stock prior to the Spin-Off. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly following the Spin-Off. See Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our common stock and the Securities Market for more detail. The shares of our common stock distributed to Cleartronic shareholders will be freely transferable, except for shares received by individuals who are our affiliates. Individuals who may be considered our affiliates after the Spin-Off include individuals who control, are controlled by or are under common control with us, as those terms generally are interpreted for federal securities law purposes. These individuals may include some or all of our directors and executive officers. Individuals who are our affiliates will be permitted to sell their shares of our common stock only pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, such as those afforded by Section 4(1) of the Securities Act or Rule 144 thereunder. Reasons for Furnishing this Prospectus We are furnishing this Prospectus solely to provide information to Cleartronics shareholders who will receive shares of our common stock in the Distribution. You should not construe this Prospectus as an inducement or encouragement to buy, hold or sell any of our securities or any securities of Cleartronic. We believe that the information contained in this Prospectus is accurate as of the date set forth on the cover. Changes to the information contained in this Prospectus may occur after that date, and neither we nor Cleartronic undertakes any obligation to update the information except in the normal course of our and Cleartronics public disclosure obligations and practices and except as required by applicable law. Important Federal Income Tax Consequences -15- The Spin-Off may or may not be tax-free for Cleartronic shareholders. We do not have any ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service nor do we have a favorable opinion by our accounting firm or any other expert confirming the Spin-Offs tax status, nor do we plan to obtain one. Cleartronic shareholders should consult with their own tax advisor as to the particular consequences of the Spin-Off to them. Resale of Shares Effective as of April 1, 2018, we committed to sell an aggregate of 650,000 shares of our common stock to six (6) private investors at a price of $.06 to $.166 per share, with such purchase being subject to the effectiveness of the registration statement. After the registration statement is declared effective, we have agreed to register for resale the shares issued to these private investors. We have also agreed to register for resale an aggregate of 6 million shares of common stock owned by an executive officer and director. SELLING SHAREHOLDERS The following individuals listed below are the Selling Shareholders who are selling the Resale Shares covered by this Registration Statement. The Selling Shareholders may have sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, at any time or from time to time since the date on which it provided the information regarding the shares, all or a portion of the shares of common stock beneficially owned in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. As used in this prospectus, selling shareholder  includes the person or persons listed in the table below, and the donees, pledgees, transferees or other successors-in-interest selling shares received from the named Selling Shareholder as a gift, pledge, distribution or other transfer. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3(d) promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Unless otherwise noted, each person or group identified possesses sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares, subject to community property laws where applicable. NAME Number of Resale Shares Larry Reid 6,000,000 Harry Schloss 100,000 Carl Feuerstein 100,000 Janet Mortensen 100,000 Frank Vicino, Jr. 150,000 Frank Vicino, Sr. 150,000 Thomas Mahoney 50,000 PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION Distribution Shares This Prospectus covers the distribution of 24,111,183 shares of our common stock owned by Cleartronic to its shareholders owning common stock, Series C and Series D preferred stock. The Distribution will be accomplished ten (10) days after the Record Date. The mechanics of the Distribution will be performed by our transfer agent, ClearTrust. -16- Resale by Selling Shareholders Each Selling Shareholder of our common stock and any of their donees, pledgees, transferees, assignees and other successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any or all of their shares of common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board or any other stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. A Selling Shareholder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares: · ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers; · block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; · purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account; · an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange; · privately negotiated transactions; · settlement of short sales entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part; · broker-dealers may agree with the Selling Shareholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share; · through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise; · a combination of any such methods of sale; or · any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. The Selling Shareholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus. Broker-dealers engaged by any Selling Shareholder may arrange for other broker-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling Shareholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA NASD Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with FINRA IM-2440. In connection with the sale of our common stock or interests therein, the Selling Shareholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, who may in turn engage in short sales of our common stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. However, the Selling Shareholders will not sell shares of our common stock short. The Selling Shareholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). The Selling Shareholders and any underwriters, broker-dealers or agents that participate in the sale of our common stock or interests therein will be considered underwriters within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act in connection with such sales and, as such, any discounts, commissions, concessions or profit they earn on any resale of the shares may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act. Since the Selling Shareholders are deemed to be an -17- underwriter within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act, it will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. In no event shall any broker-dealer receive fees, commissions and markups which, in the aggregate, would exceed eight percent (8%). We are required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by us incident to the registration of the shares. We have agreed to indemnify the Selling Shareholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. The Selling Shareholders are subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act including Rule 172 thereunder. In addition, any securities covered by this prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than this prospectus. There is no underwriter or coordinating broker-dealer acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale shares by the Selling Shareholders. The Resale Shares will be sold only through registered or licensed broker-dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale shares may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with. As of the date of this prospectus, we have not filed for registration or qualification in any state. Under applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale shares may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to our common stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the Selling Shareholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of shares of our common stock by the Selling Shareholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the Selling Shareholders and have informed them of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act). MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS Public Market for Common Stock There is currently no trading market for our common stock. We intend to apply to qualify our common stock for quotation on the OTC Markets Pink or other secondary market for which it qualifies under a symbol yet to be determined. We cannot, however, ensure that we will be successful in either case or that an active trading market will exist thereafter. Shares of our common stock distributed to holders in connection with the Spin-Off will, as of the Distribution Date, be transferable without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) except for shares received by persons who may be deemed to be our affiliates. Our affiliates after the Spin-Off generally will include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with us, which may include our executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders. Securities held by our affiliates will be subject to resale restrictions under the Securities Act. After the effective date of this Registration Statement and the distribution of the Spin-Off Shares, 100% of the shares of VoiceInterops common stock distributed by Cleartronic in the Spin-Off will be unrestricted and freely salable. We expect to have our common stock either quoted on the OTC Markets Pink or other secondary markets, but there can be assurances that such application will be accepted, or that if accepted, any market for our shares will ever develop. Holders -18- Immediately following the Spin-Off of the Spin-Off Shares, we anticipate that there will be approximately 312 record holders of VoiceInterops common stock. Dividends Since its incorporation, VoiceInterop has not declared any dividends on its common stock. VoiceInterop does not anticipate declaring or paying a dividend on its common stock for the foreseeable future. We plan to retain any future earnings for use in our business activities. Transfer Agent The transfer agent and registrar for VoiceInterops common stock will be ClearTrust Transfer LLC. Equity Compensation Plans As of the date of this Prospectus, VoiceInterop does not have any equity compensation plans. USE OF PROCEEDS VoiceInterop will not receive any proceeds from the shares of common stock distributed in the Spin-Off. The Selling Shareholders will receive all of the proceeds from the sale of the Resale Shares and we will receive none of these proceeds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Prospectus. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under the heading RISK FACTORS and elsewhere in this Prospectus. Our actual results and the timing of selected events discussed below could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. OVERVIEW VoiceInterop was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on November 15, 2007. VoiceInterop sells hardware and software solutions for unified group communications, which are deployed by commercial enterprises, as well as government emergency responders, airports and educational institutions. VoiceInterop will continue to focus on our leading product, the airport crash phone system, named Command Phone. While not limited to airports, its primary function is group calling to a fixed set of endpoints (phones, speakers, etc.) so that everybody in the relevant community receives the same message simultaneously. VoiceInterop has elected to establish its fiscal year end as September 30. Results of OperationsFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2018 (2018) Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2017 (2017) Revenues. -21- Revenues increased 7% to $191,635 in 2018, from $179,377 during the fiscal year ended September 2017. This increase of approximately $12,200 was primarily due to two new Command Phone installations in the year ended September 30, 2018 while we completed one installation in the year ended September 30, 2017. Cost of Revenues and Gross Margins. Cost of revenues decreased from $90,102 in 2017, to $80,604 in 2018. Gross margins increased approximately 8%, from 50% or $89,275 in 2017 to 58% or $111,031 in 2018. Operating Expenses. Operating expenses increased approximately 97% in 2018, to $188,317 compared to $95,678 in 2017. Operating expenses include acquisition costs of $95,817 incurred in 2018 while there were no acquisition cost in 2017. Selling Expenses. Selling expenses increased approximately 46% from $19,368 in 2017, to $28,300 in 2018, primarily due to increased commissions associated with sales of products and services. Administrative Expenses. Administrative expenses decreased to $64,200 in 2018 from $76,310 in 2017, primarily because one employee became an independent contractor from salaried employee because his position did not warrant full-time status. Other Income Other income increased from $830 in 2017 to $3,442 in 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased fees generated from processing credit card transaction for an unrelated party. Net Incomet (Loss). Net loss was $(73,844) for 2018 compared with $(5,573) for 2017. Liquidity and Capital Resources. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $18,149 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, to $285. Net used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, was $66,604 as compared to $26,652 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, due primarily to the increase net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018. We funded our operating activities during the most recent fiscal year through contributions from unrelated parties in the amount of $68,000. Six private investors have agreed to purchase 650,000 shares of common stock of VoiceInterop for $68,000. At September 30, 2018, our total liabilities were $106,806, which included $10,086 in accounts payable, $28,720 in deferred revenue and $68,000 due to unrelated parties. Our current operating expenses are approximately $9,000 per month. In order for us to cover our monthly operating expenses, we must generate approximately $18,000 per month in revenue. Accordingly, in the absence of sufficient revenues, we must raise $9,000 in equity or debt capital each month to cover our overhead expenses. In order to remain in business for one year without any revenues, we must secure $108,000 in equity or debt capital. If we are unsuccessful in securing sufficient capital or revenues, we will be unable to continue our business activities. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $0 for both fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, and September 30, 2017. -22- Financing Activities. Net cash from financing activities amounted to $48,455 in fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, $68,000 of which was provided by unrelated parties to be converted into VoiceInterop common stock on effective date of this prospectus. There was $44,541 in cash from financing activities in fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, all of which was provided to our parent company Cleartronic, Inc. Results of Operations for Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Revenues. Revenues increased approximately 101% to $45,551 for the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $22,618 for the three months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to the additional revenue generated by from a new airport Command Phone installation completed in December 2018. Sales of AudioMate gateways increased approximately 77% to $5,296 in the three months ended December 31, 2018 from $2,986 for the same period in 2017. Third party hardware sales increased 243% to $9,536 in the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2,780 in the same period in 2017. Command Phone software sales increased 100% to $8,995 in the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared with $0 sales in the same period in 2017. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $8,994 for the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $8,088 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately 11%. This increase was primarily due to costs associated with third party hardware costs associated with a Command Phone project completed in December 2018 resulting in a 100% increase in sales. Operating Expenses. Operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2018 were $31,302 compared to $21,277 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately 47%. The increase was primarily due to legal expenses associated with the preparation of an S-1 registration statement for the spin-off of VoiceInterop from Cleartronic. Income (Loss) from Operations. Income from operations for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was $5,255 compared to a loss of ($6,747) for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The change from loss to profit from operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 versus December 31, 2017 was due to an increase in revenue from $22,618 in 2017 to $45,551 in 2018. The increased revenue was generated by a Command Phone project completed in December 2018. Other Income (Expenses). Other income (expenses) increased to $191 during the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared with $0 for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Net Income (Loss) Net income attributable to common shareholders was $5,446 for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of ($6,747) for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Net income per common share was $5.45 and ($6.75) for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources. -23- Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $29,289 for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $(5,281) for the three months ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was mainly attributable to the increase in accounts receivable offset by the increase in accounts payable. Net cash used in investing activities was $(25,000) for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0 for the three months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to the issuance of a note receivable to a shareholder in the amount of $25,000. Net cash used in financing activities was $(2,583) for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to ($9,677) for the three months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to receipt of $43,810 from an installment loan off set by contributions to our parent Cleartronic, Inc. Management believes that the Spin-Off of VoiceInterop into its own operating company will allow the VoiceInterop to raise additional capital to grow the business. There can be no assurance that the VoiceInterops efforts in this Spin-Off will be successful or that raising additional capital will be sufficient to meet current and future obligations. We have incurred losses since our inception and continue to require additional capital to fund operations and development. As such, our ability to pay our already incurred obligations is mostly dependent on the VoiceInterop being able to have substantially increased revenues and raising substantial additional capital through the sale of its equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that the VoiceInterop will be successful in accomplishing any of the foregoing. We believe that in order to fund our business plan, we will need approximately $1,000,000 in new equity or debt capital. In the past, in addition to revenues and deferred revenues, we have obtained funds from the private sale of our debt and equity securities. We have also had discussions with several securities broker-dealers with respect to a private or public offering of our securities. Although none of such discussions has resulted in any funding, we intend to continue to have such discussions in the future. We also intend to continue to seek private financing from certain of our existing shareholders and others. Our operating expenses are approximately $9,000 per month. In order for us to cover our monthly operating expenses, we must generate approximately $18,000 per month in revenue. Accordingly, in the absence of sufficient revenues, we must raise $9,000 in equity or debt capital each month to cover our overhead expenses. In order to remain in business for one year without any revenues, we must secure $108,000 in equity or debt capital. If we are unsuccessful in securing sufficient capital or revenues, we will be unable to continue our business activities. Command Phone Sales and Marketing Plan VoiceInterop has addressed a market demand for immediate emergency communication with the development of its Command Phone solution for enterprise and public safety organizations. This proprietary VoIP emergency notification system is customized to organizations specific requirements such as Airport Crash Net phones and industrial campus IP phone networks. This system is essentially an outbound conference call to multiple recipients in real time providing instant audio communication. Utilizing existing or new IP networks this highly customizable and scalable phone communication system has been deployed at major international airports in North America as well as Fortune 1000 companies as the primary phone emergency notification platform. However, the Command Phone is more than just phones. It has flexibility to include overhead paging speakers in addition to, or in lieu of, a conventional telephone station. A VoiceInterop AudioMate360 RoIP (Radio over IP) gateway can be introduced to transmit the audio alert over a radio channel to field units. The system can send voice alerts to off campus personnel via cell phones and the public telephone network. The Command Phone system can even trigger existing alerting systems to open doors, turn on the lights, and activate other functions at the start of an emergency alert call. The concentration of VoiceInterop sales and marketing to date has been to the airport industry. To realize increased revenue and further monetize the Command Phone solution market penetration in various additional vertical sectors such as industrial campuses, utilities and educational organizations will require additional marketing dollars. These marketing funds would be used to advertise in vertical industry trade publications, direct and indirect -24- sales activities, Constant Contact email campaigns, and industry association memberships and trade shows. These activities would be primarily focused on regional organizations to establish market share and shorten the sales cycle compared to large national opportunities. If we are successful in securing additional equity or debt capital, the following is a schedule of use of proceeds: Use of Funds Amount Advertising and promotion $200,000 Trade show expenses 100,000 Salaries, wages, office expense 375,000 Research and development 100,000 Professional fees and working capital 225,000 Total $1,000,000 The largest expense is salaries and wages which includes sales and marketing, engineering and development and administrative salaries and office expense. Advertising and trade show expenses amount to an estimated $300,000 while research and development is budgeted at $100,000. We intend to use commission only sales representatives. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2018, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and impairment of long-lived assets. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenues In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605, "Revenue Recognition." This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year, and allowed entities the option to early adopt the new revenue standard as of the original effective date. There have been multiple standards updates amending this guidance or providing corrections or improvements on issues in the guidance. The requirements for these standards relating to Topic 606 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. This standard permitted adoption using one of two transition methods, either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. The Company adopted these standards at the beginning of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed statements of operations during the three months ended December 31, 2018. The Company revenue recognition policy follows guidance from Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from contract with customers. Revenue is recognized when the Company transferred promised goods -25- and services to the customer and in the amount that reflect the consideration to which the company expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i )Identification of Contact with a customer; (ii) Identify the performant obligation of the contract (iii) Determine transaction price; (iv) Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) Recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. Unified group communication solutions consist of three elements to be provided to customers: software licenses and equipment purchased from third-party vendors, proprietary hardware that is manufactured on contract to required specifications and installation and integration of the hardware and software into a cohesive communication source. No right of return privileges are granted to customers after shipment. The Company recognizes revenue for the elements separately as the sales of the equipment and software, installation and integration, and support services represent separate earnings processes that are generally specified under separate agreements. Revenue from the resale of equipment utilized in unified group communication solutions is recognized when shipped. For software licenses, the Company does not provide any services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software, and therefore revenue is recognized upon delivery of the software, provided (1) there is evidence of an arrangement, (2) collection of the fee is considered probable and (3) the fee is fixed and determinable. The Company also provides support to customers under separate contracts varying from one to five years. The Companys obligations under its service contracts vary by the length of the contract. In all cases the Company is the primary obligor to provide first level support to the client. If the contract has less than one year of service and support remaining on the contract it is classified as a current liability, if longer it is classified as a non-current liability. Installation and integration services are recognized upon completion. Inventory. The company carries no inventory as all hardware is purchased as finished goods on an as needed basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases , which will amend current lease accounting to require lessees to recognize (i) a lease liability, which is a lessees obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessees right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 201610 (the Update) Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606): identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in -26- Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on (a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entitys promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entitys intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entitys intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments in this Update are intended to render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation to reduce the degree of judgement necessary to comply with Topic 606. The Company adopted this guidance effective October 1, 2018. Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants We have had no changes in or disagreements with our accountants. BUSINESS Overview We are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cleartronic, Inc. and were incorporated under the laws of the state of Florida on November 2007. VoiceInterop sells hardware and software solutions for unified group communications, which are deployed by commercial enterprises, as well as government emergency responders, airports and educational institutions. VoiceInterop will continue to focus on our leading product, the airport crash phone system, named Command Phone. While not limited to airports, its primary function is group calling to a fixed set of endpoints (phones, speakers, etc.) so that everybody in the relevant community receives the same message simultaneously. Need for Unified Group Communications Although public safety personnel regularly use cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other commercial wireless devices and services, we believe that these devices are currently not sufficiently suited for public safety mission critical communications during critical incidents. As an example, hundreds of firefighters and police officers rushed to rescue victims from the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. As police and firefighters swarmed the building searching for survivors, incident commanders outside were hearing warnings from helicopters circling the scene from above that the towers were beginning to glow and were dangerously close to collapse. Radio communications were a lifeline for the hundreds of police officers who received the word to evacuate the buildingall but 60 police officers escaped with their lives. Tragically, hundreds of New York firefighters and emergency workers did not receive that warning because they were using a different radio communications system. Unaware of the impending collapse, 412 firefighters and emergency workers lost their lives. A report from the University of New Hampshire based ATLAS Project stated, From numerous interviews gathered as part of a fire department inquiry into the events of September 11th, it would appear that non-interoperability was at least partially responsible for the loss of 343 firefighters at the World Trade Center. We believe that public safety officials should not depend solely on commercial communication systems that can be overloaded and that may be unreliable during critical incidents when public demand can overwhelm the systems. Public safety officials have unique and demanding communications requirements. Optimal public safety radio communication systems require: · dedicated channels and priority access that is available at all times to handle unexpected emergencies; · reliable one-to-many broadcast capability, which is not generally available in cellular systems; -27- · highly reliable and redundant networks that are engineered and maintained to withstand natural disasters and other emergencies; and · the best possible coverage within a given geographic area, with a minimum of dead zones. Unique equipment designed for quick response in emergency situationsdialing, waiting for call connection, and busy signals are unacceptable during critical events when seconds can mean the difference between life and death. We believe that our software when properly used can add value, redundancy and alternative methods of communicating for radios and radio systems and the personnel who use them. Unified Group Communication Services and Solutions We offer professional engineering, consulting, system design, installation and annual support contracts for standards based audio and voice unified group communication solutions. We have designed, built and installed eighteen unified group communication solutions for various vertical markets within government and private enterprise organizations, with an emphasis in the aviation industry as of April 1, 2018. Twelve of which utilized a third partys software solution prior to us developing our own proprietary application. We are now able to use our own proprietary software in future installations which provides the company with greater profit margins. Some of our airport clients include; Edmonton, Alberta Canada International, Palm Beach International, Omaha International (Eppley Field), Austin Bergstrom International, Southwest Florida International, Key West International. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing efforts are focused on the two aspects of our business, software and hardware. We have marketed our software solution, trade named Command Phone and the patented AudioMate360 IP gateways through our Director of Sales and Marketing. We intend to continue to develop our worldwide network of network of value added resellers (VARs). As of July 1, 2018, we had 46 VARs in our distribution network. These existing and potential VARs range in size from single-site, regional firms with specialized products and services to multi-national firms that provide a full range of information technology products and services. Sales prospects are derived from website inquiries, client referrals and trade show activities. We intend to use search engine optimization to increase the number of inquiries that we receive from our website, and if we become adequately funded, we intend to hire additional commission only d sales representatives.

These activities would be primarily focused on regional organizations to establish market share and shorten the sales cycle compared to large national opportunities. VoiceInterop Hardware and Radio Interoperability The lack of radio interoperability within and between agencies has been an issue for decades. User groups on different frequencies and using radios made by different manufacturers are not able to communicate, sometimes even within their own agency. The AudioMate360r is a cost-effective IP audio gateway for bridging most LMR (Land Mobile Radios) and IP-based unified group communication networks via RoIP (Radio over IP). Users can connect two-way land mobile radios regardless of frequency range or equipment manufacturer, whether conventional or trunked. Each AudioMate360 is completely software programmable via a web browser. The AudioMate360a Analog Gateway provides baseband audio inputs and outputs to access to VoIP (Voice over IP) unified communications network With the Audiomate360, radio talk groups on different frequencies, in different locations and using different radios communicate securely, regardless of their location via a private network or the Internet. Using AudioMates increases communications capabilities, lowers the cost, greatly simplifies the implementation and use by organizations, and extends and enables true communications interoperability between talk groups and locations. When combined with ReadyOp, the two-way radio communications can be extended to authorized ReadyOp users using their laptops and cellphones. The AudioMate 360r Radio Gateway connects to a compatible 2-way land mobile radio configured as a control station, acting as its microphone and speaker. The AM360r connects to a wide variety of radios, regardless of operating frequency, including Motorola, Kenwood, Icom, Tait, and others. There are currently several thousand AudioMate gateways deployed throughout the United States and internationally. The gateways are used in daily operations as well as in emergencies by law enforcement, fire rescue operations, hospitals, local and state government agencies, schools and universities and by private sector corporations. More than 200 million radio transmissions have already been completed via the AudioMate gateways and their use continues to grow. ReadyOp Communications The Company is a licensed distributor of ReadyOp software, which is a simple, innovative tool for effectively planning, managing, communicating and directing activities within a single organization or in a unified command structure involving multiple organizations. ReadyOp is designed to handle fast-paced, demanding communications challenges of Incident Command Response, ReadyOps flexibility supports daily, exercise and response activities for a single organization as well as unified, multi-location agencies and operations.

The Company believes there is no other program that offers the flexibility for planning, command, control and communications directly with the people and agencies involved in special events, readiness exercises, incidents and emergencies. -29- Strategic Acquisitions Our management team believes there are numerous opportunities for a new, properly capitalized public company to acquire private companies not only in our industry but in other industries where prospective companies would welcome the opportunity to benefit from being a part of a new public company. Competition The unified group communications industry is extremely competitive. Over the past year, the number of companies entering our industry has increased dramatically. Competitive pricing pressures can negatively impact profit margins, if any. Competitors include Cisco Systems, Inc., Tyco Electronics Ltd., Catalyst Communications Technologies, Inc., Telex, Inc., Federal Signal Corporation and Mutuallink, Inc. as well as Twisted Pair Solutions, Inc. and its other resellers and licensees. These and other potential competitors are generally large and well capitalized and have substantially more experience than we do in our industry. We expect to face intense competition from traditional telephone companies, wireless companies, cable companies and alternative voice communication providers. We may also face intense competition from cable companies which have added or are planning to add VoIP services to their existing product lines. The traditional wireline and wireless telephone service providers and cable companies are substantially larger and better capitalized than we are and have the advantage of a large existing customer base. Because substantially all of our prospective customers are already purchasing communications services from one or more of these providers, our success may be dependent upon, among other things, our ability to attract target customers away from their existing providers. These potential competitors could focus their substantial financial resources to develop competing technology that may be more attractive to potential customers than what we offer. Our competitors financial resources may allow them to offer services at prices below cost or without charge in order to maintain and gain market share or otherwise improve their competitive positions. Our competitors also could use their greater financial resources to offer more attractive service packages that include on-site installation and more robust customer service. In addition, because of the other services our competitors provide, they may choose to offer unified group communication services as part of a bundle that includes other products, such as VoIP telephone service, video, high speed Internet access and wireless telephone service, which we do not and cannot offer. This bundle may enable our competitors to offer unified group communication service at price levels with which we may not be able to compete or to offer functionality that integrates that service with their other offerings, both of which may be more desirable to consumers. Any of these competitive factors could make it difficult or impossible for us to attract and retain customers, cause us to lower our prices in order to compete and reduce our market share and revenues. Employees As of April 1, 2019, VoiceInterop has two employees, consisting of: Larry Reid as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Director and James Concannon as the Director of Sales and Marketing.

Subject to the rights of the holders of our preferred stock, holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends that may be declared by our board of directors out of legally available funds. Voting Rights. Except as otherwise required by law or as may be provided in the resolutions of the board of directors authorizing the issuance of any class or series of preferred stock, the holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders and do not have cumulative voting rights. Holders of our common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors may elect by a plurality of the votes cast for nominees for election to our board of directors. Liquidation Rights. Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, whether voluntary or involuntary, and after the holders of our preferred stock have been paid in full the amounts to which they are entitled, if any, the holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets available for distribution after payment in full to our creditors and holders of our preferred stock, if any. Other Provisions. The holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive or similar rights. The outstanding shares of our common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that our board of directors may designate and we may issue in the future. Preferred Stock We are currently authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which are issued and outstanding. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may designate and issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock from our authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. Subject to limitations imposed by law or our articles of incorporation, our board of directors is empowered to determine: (i) the voting rights, whether special or conditional, full or limited of each class or series of preferred stock, (ii) the designation of and the number of shares comprising the class or series of preferred stock, (ii) the preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, if any, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any with respect to any class or series, (iv) the redemption prices and terms applicable, if any, to any class or series of preferred stock, (v) whether or not the shares of a class or series will be subject to a retirement or sinking fund and the terms applicable thereto, (vi) the dividend rights and dividend rate, if any, for any class or series of preferred stock, (vii) the amounts payable on the series upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, (viii) the terms and condition s of any conversion rights for the class or series of preferred stock, if any and (ix) the terms and conditions of any other special rights and protective provisions that the Board of Directors deems advisable. Anti-Takeover Provisions Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Florida law contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control. These provisions include those which permit our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships and specify advance notice procedures that must be complied with by shareholders in order to make shareholder proposals or nominate directors. In addition, the authorized but unissued shares of our common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without shareholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the listing standards of the Nasdaq. These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate finance transactions, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock (and our board of directors authority to establish the rights, preferences and limitation of the preferred stock, as described above) could make more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. -37- As a Florida corporation, we are also subject to the provisions of the FBCA, including those limiting the voting rights of “control shares.” Under the FBCA, subject to certain exceptions, including mergers and acquisitions effected in accordance with the FBCA, the holder of “control shares” of a Florida corporation that has (i) 100 or more shareholders, (ii) its principal place of business, its principal office or substantial assets in Florida and (iii) either more than 10% of its shareholders residing in Florida, more than 10% of its shares owned by Florida residents or 1,000 shareholders residing in Florida, will not have the right to vote those shares unless the acquisition of the shares was approved by a majority of each class of voting securities of the corporation, excluding those shares held by interested persons. Control shares are defined in the FBCA as shares acquired by a person, either directly or indirectly, that when added to all other shares of the issuing corporation owned by that person, would entitle that person to exercise, either directly or indirectly, voting power within any of the following ranges: (i) 20% or more but less than 33% of all voting power of the corporations voting securities; (ii) 33% or more but less than a majority of all voting power of the corporations voting securities; or (iii) a majority or more of all of the voting power of the corporations voting securities. Indemnification Section 607.0850 of the FBCA and our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide for the indemnification of each of our directors and officers against claims, liabilities, amounts paid in settlement and expenses if such director or officer is or was a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that such person is or was our director or officer or is or was serving as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise at our request, which may include liabilities under the Securities Act. In addition, we carry insurance permitted by the laws of the State of Florida on behalf of directors, officers, employees or agents which covers alleged or actual error or omission, misstatement, misleading misstatement, neglect or breach of fiduciary duty while acting solely as a director or officer of our VoiceInterop, which acts may also include liabilities under the Securities Act. To the extent our directors and officers are indemnified against liabilities arising under the Securities Act, whether under the provisions contained in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or our Amended and Restated Bylaws or pursuant to Florida law or other contractual arrangements providing for indemnification which we may enter into from time to time, we have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Boards of Directors of VoiceInterop and Cleartronic have each separately adopted a written Related Party Transaction Policy for the review, approval and ratification of transactions involving the related parties of VoiceInterop and Cleartronic, respectively. In each case, related parties are directors and nominees for director, executive officers and immediate family members of the foregoing, as well as security holders known to beneficially own more than five percent of our common stock. The policy covers any transaction, arrangement or relationship, or series of transactions, arrangements or relationships, in which Cleartronic and/or VoiceInterop was, is or will be a participant and the amount exceeds $120,000, and in which a related party has any direct or indirect interest. The policy is administered by the appropriate board acting as a committee of the whole. -38- In determining whether to approve or ratify a related party transaction, the appropriate board will consider whether or not the transaction is in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the appropriate company. In making this determination, the appropriate board is required to consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances in light of the following factors and any other factors to the extent deemed pertinent by the committee: · whether the terms of the Related Party Transaction are fair to the company and on the same basis as would apply if the transaction did not involve a Related Party; · whether there are business reasons for the company to enter into the Related Party Transaction; · whether the Related Party Transaction would impair the independence of an outside director, if applicable; and · whether the Related Party Transaction would present an improper conflict of interests for any director or executive officer of the company, taking into account the size of the transaction, the overall financial position of the director, executive officer or Related Party, the direct or indirect nature of the director's, executive officer's or Related Party's interest in the transaction and the ongoing nature of any proposed relationship, and any other factors the board deems relevant. The policy contains standing pre-approvals for certain types of transactions which, even though they may fall within the definition of a related party transaction, are deemed to be pre-approved by VoiceInterop and/or Cleartronic given their nature, size and/or degree of significance to the appropriate company. In the event VoiceInterop and/or Cleartronic inadvertently enters into a related party transaction that requires, but has not received, pre-approval under the policy, the transaction will be presented to the appropriate board for review and ratification promptly upon discovery. In such event, the committee will consider whether such transaction should be rescinded or modified and whether any changes in our controls and procedures or other actions are needed. For a discussion of the potential conflicts of interest between VoiceInterop and Cleartronic, see  Relationship between VoiceInterop and Cleartronic Following the Spin-off . Cleartronic believes that any past transactions with its affiliates have been at prices and on terms no less favorable to us than transactions with independent third parties. We may enter into transactions with its affiliates in the future. We intend to continue to enter into such transactions only at prices and on terms no less favorable to us than transactions with independent third parties. In this context, we will require any director or officer who has a pecuniary interest in a matter being considered to excuse him or herself from any negotiations.

In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, a person, or group of persons whose shares are required to be aggregated, who is deemed to have been an affiliate at any time during the three months preceding a sale, who has beneficially owned shares that are restricted securities as defined in Rule 144 for at least six months is entitled to sell, within any three-month period commencing 90 days after the date of this Prospectus, a number of shares that does not exceed 1% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, which will be approximately 241,121 shares. In addition, a person who is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at any time during the 90 days preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned shares of our common stock for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner, except if the prior owner was one of our affiliates, would be entitled to sell all of their shares, provided the availability of current public information about our company. To the extent that shares were acquired from one of our affiliates, a person's holding period for the purpose of effecting a sale under Rule 144 would commence on the date the shares were acquired from the affiliate. -41- EXPERTS The financial statements of Voiceinterop, Inc. at September 30, 2018 and 2017, have been audited, by Liggett & Webb P.A., an independent registered public accounting firm, as set forth in their report thereon appearing elsewhere in this Prospectus and are included in reliance upon such report given on the authority of such firm as an expert in accounting and auditing.

Our bylaws provide that we will advance to any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of us, or is or was serving at the request of us as a director or executive officer of another company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefore, all expenses incurred by any director or officer in connection with such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under the bylaws or otherwise. Our bylaws provide that no advance shall be made by us to an officer except by reason of the fact that such officer is or was our director in which event this paragraph shall not apply, in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly made: (a) by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (b) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of us .

UNDERTAKINGS a) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: (a)(1) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any Prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) To reflect in the Prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of Prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement. (2) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (h) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. -45- SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized in the City of Boca Raton, State of Florida, on the 13th day of May 2019. VoiceInterop, Inc. By: /s/Larry Reid Name: Larry Reid Title: President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Director Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, this registration statement has been signed by the following persons in the capacities and on the dates indicated.

Neill Member of the Board of Directors May 13, 2019 -46- REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of: Voiceinterop, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Voiceinterop, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2018 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the  financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Explanatory Paragraph  Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has recurring losses, a working capital deficit and an accumulated deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal controls over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Liggett & Webb, P.A. LIGGETT & WEBB, P.A.

Notes to Financial Statements September 30, 2018 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION, AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ORGANIZATION The accompanying financial statements include the historical accounts of VoiceInterop, Inc. (VoiceInterop), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cleartronic, Inc. (Cleartronic or Parent). VoiceInterop, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the state of Florida on November 15, 2007. On March 21, 2018, the Board of Directors approved plans for the complete legal and structural separation of VoiceInterop from Cleartronic (the Spin-Off). The Spin-Off is expected to be executed by a special dividend distribution to holders off Cleartronics common stock and holders of Cleartronics Series C and D Convertible Preferred stock. Cleartronic common stock shareholders will receive .075 shares of VoiceInterop common stock for each one (1) share of Cleartronic common stock held. Cleartronic Series C and D Preferred shareholders will receive .375 shares of VoiceInterop common stock for each one (1) share of Series C or D Preferred share held. Any fractional shares will be rounded up. Following the Spin-Off, Cleartronic will not own any equity interest in us, and we will operate independently from Cleartronic. The Company, designs, builds and installs unified group communication solutions, including unique hardware and customized software under the tradename CommandPhone, for public and private enterprises and markets those services and products under the VoiceInterop brand name. The Company also provides support for these communication installations under a Support Agreement with the customer. These agreements range from one to five years. The Company also sells IP Gateways for Land Mobile Radio installations under the tradename VoiceInterop. The gateway is manufactured by Cleartronic, Inc. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a stand-alone basis and are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cleartronic, Inc. Our financial statements reflect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as we were historically managed, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). VoiceInterop has historically operated as a part of Cleartronic and not as a stand-alone company. The financial statements have been derived from Cleartronics historical accounting records and are presented on a stand-alone basis. The accompanying financial statements include the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses that are directly attributable to VoiceInterop. In addition, certain costs related to VoiceInterop as well as allocations deemed reasonable by management have been included to present the financial position, results of operations, changes in equity and cash flows of VoiceInterop on a stand-alone basis. The allocation methodologies have been described within the notes to the financial statements where appropriate. These allocated costs are primarily related to corporate administrative expenses, including administrative and technical employee related costs including benefits for corporate and shared employees, and fees for other corporate and support services. Income taxes have been accounted for in these financial statements as described in Income Taxes section. The financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect the financial position, results of operations, changes in equity and cash flows of VoiceInterop in the future or what they have been had VoiceInterop been a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. F-6 USE OF ESTIMATES In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and operations for the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on managements knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results. Significant estimates include the assumption used in valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred tax assets. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS For financial statement purposes, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company did not own any cash equivalents at September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon a periodic review and analysis of outstanding accounts receivable balances. Uncollectible receivables are charged to the allowance when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are used to credit the allowance account in the periods in which the recoveries are made. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK The Company currently maintains cash balances at one FDIC-insured banking institution. Deposits held in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 at all FDIC-insured institutions. At September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the Company had no cash balances above the FDIC-insured limit, respectively. REVENUE RECOGNITION AND DEFERRED REVENUES Unified group communication solutions consist of three elements to be provided to customers: software licenses developed by the Company, equipment purchased from third-party vendors, and proprietary hardware that is manufactured on contract to required specifications and installation and integration of the hardware and software into the cohesive communication source. The Company's revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 605-10 Revenue Recognition (ASC 605-10). Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the contract price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. No right of return privileges are granted to customers after shipment. The Company recognizes revenue for the elements separately as the sales of the equipment and software, installation and integration, and support services represent separate earnings processes that are generally specified under separate agreements. Revenue from the resale of equipment utilized in unified group communication solutions is recognized when shipped. For software licenses, the Company does not provide any services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software, and therefore revenue is recognized upon delivery of the software, provided (1) there is evidence of an arrangement, (2) collection of the fee is considered probable and (3) the fee is fixed and determinable. The Company also provides support to customers under separate contracts varying from one to five years. The Companys obligations under its service contracts vary by the length of the contract. In all cases the Company is the primary obligor to provide first level support to the client. If the contract has less than one year of service and support remaining on the contract, it is classified as a current liability; if longer, it is classified as a non-current liability. F-7 Installation and integration services are recognized upon completion. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE In accordance with accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC 260 Earning per Share, basic (loss) per common share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods reported. Diluted earnings per share include the weighted average effect of all dilutive securities outstanding during the periods presented. Diluted per share loss is the same as basic per share loss when there is a loss from continuing operations. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company adopted ASC topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), Fair Value Measurements, effective January 1, 2009. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets.  Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  Level 3: Inputs that are generally unobservable. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in managements best estimate of fair value. Financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments in the accompanying balance sheet approximate their fair values due to their relatively short-term nature. The fair value of long-term debt is based on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities. The carrying amounts approximate fair value. It is managements opinion that the Company is not exposed to any significant currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. INVENTORY The Company maintains no inventory. All hardware items are purchased on an as needed basis from third party vendors. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are recorded at cost. For financial statement purposes depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the asset. Expenditures for replacements, maintenance and repairs that do not extend the lives of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired, sold or otherwise disposed of, their costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and resulting gains or losses are recognized. F-8 As of September 30, 2018, and September 30, 2017 all property and equipment had been fully depreciated. INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires that the Company recognizes income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a tax rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized. Changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances. The Company is required to recognize measure, classify, and disclose in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the Companys tax returns. Management has determined that the Company does not have any uncertain tax positions and associated unrecognized benefits that materially impact the financial statements or related disclosures. Since tax matters are subject to some degree of uncertainty, there can be no assurance that the Companys tax returns will not be challenged by the taxing authorities and that the Company will not be subject to additional tax penalties, and interest because of such challenge. The federal and state income tax returns of the Company for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are subject to examination by the IRS and state taxing authorities generally for three years after they were filed. There are no tax examinations currently in process. The Companys tax returns were filed as consolidated returns were filed as consolidated returns with Cleartronic, Inc. for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015. NOTE 2 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases , which will amend current lease accounting to require lessees to recognize (i) a lease liability, which is a lessees obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessees right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 201610 Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606): identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on (a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entitys promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entitys intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entitys intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments in this Update are intended render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation to reduce the degree of judgement necessary to comply with Topic 606. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. F-9 NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN During the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, and since inception, the Company has experienced cash flow problems. From time-to-time, the Company has experienced difficulties meeting its obligations as they became due. The Company believes that as a stand-alone entity with a new capital structure it will be able to raise debt and equity capital and acquire other companies. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017. The Company believes that becoming a separate corporate entity with a simple capital structure it will be able to raise additional capital and complete strategic acquisitions. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. There is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern without raising additional debt or equity capital. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 4  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS VoiceInterop has been allocated expenses from Cleartronic for the year ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These allocated costs, which are included in selling and administrative expenses and are primarily related to corporate administrative expenses, including administrative and technical employee related costs including benefits for corporate and shared employees, and fees for other corporate and support services. The costs for these services and support functions have been allocated to VoiceInterop using the most meaningful allocation methodology which was based on proportionate direct costs. All of VoiceInterops transactions with Cleartronic are considered to be financing transactions, which are presented as net contributions from Parent in the accompanying statements of cash flows.

Notes to Condensed Financial Statements December 31, 2018 (unaudited) NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION, AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ORGANIZATION The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include the historical accounts of VoiceInterop, Inc. (VoiceInterop), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cleartronic, Inc. (Cleartronic or Parent). VoiceInterop, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the state of Florida on November 15, 2007. On March 21, 2018, the Board of Directors approved plans for the complete legal and structural separation of VoiceInterop from Cleartronic (the Spin-Off). The Spin-Off is expected to be executed by a special dividend distribution to holders off Cleartronics common stock and holders of Cleartronics Series C and D Convertible Preferred stock. Cleartronic common stock shareholders will receive .075 shares of VoiceInterop common stock for each one (1) share of Cleartronic common stock held. Cleartronic Series C and D Preferred shareholders will receive .375 shares of VoiceInterop common stock for each one (1) share of Series C or D Preferred share held. Any fractional shares will be rounded up. Following the Spin-Off, Cleartronic will not own any equity interest in us, and we will operate independently from Cleartronic. The Company, designs, builds and installs unified group communication solutions, including unique hardware and customized software under the tradename CommandPhone, for public and private enterprises and markets those services and products under the VoiceInterop brand name. The Company also provides support for these communication installations under a Support Agreement with the customer. These agreements range from one to five years. The Company also sells IP Gateways for Land Mobile Radio installations under the tradename VoiceInterop. The gateway is manufactured by Cleartronic, Inc. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared on a stand-alone basis and are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cleartronic, Inc. Our condensed financial statements reflect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as we were historically managed, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). VoiceInterop has historically operated as a part of Cleartronic and not as a stand-alone company. The unaudited financial statements have been derived from Cleartronics historical accounting records and are presented on a stand-alone basis. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses that are directly attributable to VoiceInterop. In addition, certain costs related to VoiceInterop as well as allocations deemed reasonable by management have been included to present the financial position, results of operations, changes in equity and cash flows of VoiceInterop on a stand-alone basis. The allocation methodologies have been described within the notes to the unaudited financial statements where appropriate. These allocated costs are primarily related to corporate administrative expenses, including administrative and technical employee related costs including benefits for corporate and shared employees, and fees for other corporate and support services. Income taxes have been accounted for in these condensed unaudited financial statements as described in Income Taxes section. The unaudited condensed financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect the financial position, results of operations, changes in equity and cash flows of VoiceInterop in the future or what they have been had VoiceInterop been a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. USE OF ESTIMATES F-16 In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and operations for the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on managements knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results. Significant estimates include the assumption used in valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred tax asset. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS For financial statement purposes, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company did not own any cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon a periodic review and analysis of outstanding accounts receivable balances. Uncollectible receivables are charged to the allowance when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are used to credit the allowance account in the periods in which the recoveries are made. The Company provided $0 and $0 allowances for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018, respectively. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK The Company currently maintains cash balances at one FDIC-insured banking institution. Deposits held in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 at all FDIC-insured institutions. At December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018, the Company had no cash balances above the FDIC-insured limit, respectively. REVENUE RECOGNITION AND DEFERRED REVENUES In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605, "Revenue Recognition." This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year, and allowed entities the option to early adopt the new revenue standard as of the original effective date. There have been multiple standards updates amending this guidance or providing corrections or improvements on issues in the guidance. The requirements for these standards relating to Topic 606 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. This standard permitted adoption using one of two transition methods, either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. The Company adopted these standards at the beginning of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed statements of operations during the three months ended December 31, 2018. The Company revenue recognition policy follows guidance from Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from contract with customers. Revenue is recognized when the Company transferred promised goods and services to the customer and in the amount that reflect the consideration to which the company expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. F-17 The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) Identification of Contact with a customer; (ii) Identify the performant obligation of the contract (iii) Determine transaction price; (iv) Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) Recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. Unified group communication solutions consist of three elements to be provided to customers: software licenses and equipment purchased from third-party vendors, proprietary hardware that is manufactured on contract to required specifications and installation and integration of the hardware and software into a cohesive communication source. No right of return privileges are granted to customers after shipment. The Company recognizes revenue for the elements separately as the sales of the equipment and software, installation and integration, and support services represent separate earnings processes that are generally specified under separate agreements. Revenue from the resale of equipment utilized in unified group communication solutions is recognized when shipped. For software licenses, the Company does not provide any services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software, and therefore revenue is recognized upon delivery of the software, provided (1) there is evidence of an arrangement, (2) collection of the fee is considered probable and (3) the fee is fixed and determinable. The Company also provides support to customers under separate contracts varying from one to five years. The Companys obligations under its service contracts vary by the length of the contract. In all cases the Company is the primary obligor to provide first level support to the client. If the contract has less than one year of service and support remaining on the contract it is classified as a current liability, if longer it is classified as a non-current liability. Installation and integration services are recognized upon completion. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE In accordance with accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC 260 Earning per Share, basic (loss) per common share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods reported. Diluted earnings per share include the weighted average effect of all dilutive securities outstanding during the periods presented. Diluted per share loss is the same as basic per share loss when there is a loss from continuing operations. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company adopted ASC topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), Fair Value Measurements, effective January 1, 2009. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets.  Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  Level 3: Inputs that are generally unobservable. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in managements best estimate of fair value. F-18 Financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments in the accompanying balance sheet approximate their fair values due to their relatively short-term nature. The fair value of long-term debt is based on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities. The carrying amounts approximate fair value. It is managements opinion that the Company is not exposed to any significant currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. INVENTORY The Company maintains no inventory. All hardware items are purchased on an as needed basis from third party vendors. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are recorded at cost. For financial statement purposes depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the asset. Expenditures for replacements, maintenance and repairs that do not extend the lives of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired, sold or otherwise disposed of, their costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and resulting gains or losses are recognized. As of December 31, 2018, and September 30, 2018 all property and equipment had been fully depreciated. INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires that the Company recognizes income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a tax rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized. Changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances. The Company is required to recognize measure, classify, and disclose in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the Companys tax returns. Management has determined that the Company does not have any uncertain tax positions and associated unrecognized benefits that materially impact the financial statements or related disclosures. Since tax matters are subject to some degree of uncertainty, there can be no assurance that the Companys tax returns will not be challenged by the taxing authorities and that the Company will not be subject to additional tax penalties, and interest because of such challenge. The federal and state income tax returns of the Company for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are subject to examination by the IRS and state taxing authorities generally for three years after they were filed. There are no tax examinations currently in process. The Companys tax returns were filed as consolidated returns with Cleartronic, Inc. for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016. NOTE 2 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases , which will amend current lease accounting to require lessees to recognize (i) a lease liability, which is a lessees obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessees right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. F-19 NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN During the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and since inception, the Company has experienced cash flow problems. From time-to-time, the Company has experienced difficulties meeting its obligations as they became due. The Company believes that as a stand-alone entity with a new capital structure it will be able to raise debt and equity capital and acquire other companies. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018. The Company believes that becoming a separate corporate entity with a simple capital structure it will be able to raise additional capital and complete strategic acquisitions. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. There is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern without additional debt or equity capital. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 4  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS VoiceInterop has been allocated expenses from Cleartronic for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These allocated costs, which are included in selling and administrative expenses and are primarily related to corporate administrative expenses, including administrative and technical employee related costs including benefits for corporate and shared employees, and fees for other corporate and support services. The costs for these services and support functions have been allocated to VoiceInterop using the most meaningful allocation methodology which was based on proportionate direct costs. All of VoiceInterops transactions with Cleartronic are considered to be financing transactions, which are presented as net contributions from Parent in the accompanying statements of cash flows.
