For the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share, an explanation of why we present these metrics and a description of the limitations of these non-GAAP measures, as well as a reconciliation to net income, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Evaluate Growth. When we use the terms we, us, our, LPL or the company, we mean LPL Investment Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries, including LPL Financial Corporation (LPL Financial), taken as a whole, as well as the predecessor entity LPL Holdings, Inc. (predecessor), unless the context otherwise indicates. Overview We provide an integrated platform of proprietary technology, brokerage and investment advisory services to over 12,000 independent financial advisors and financial advisors at financial institutions (our advisors) across the country, enabling them to successfully service their retail investors with unbiased, conflict-free financial advice. In addition, we support over 4,000 financial advisors with customized clearing, advisory platforms and technology solutions. Our singular focus is to support our advisors with the front, middle and back-office support they need to serve the large and growing market for independent investment advice, particularly in the mass affluent market (which we define as investors with $100,000  $1,000,000 in investable assets). We believe we are the only company that offers advisors the unique combination of an integrated technology platform, comprehensive self-clearing services and full open architecture access to leading financial products, all delivered in an environment unencumbered by conflicts from product manufacturing, underwriting or market making. For over 20 years we have served the independent advisor market. We currently support the largest independent advisor base and the fifth largest overall advisor base in the United States. Through our advisors, we are also one of the largest distributors of financial products in the United States. Our scale is a substantial competitive advantage and enables us to more effectively attract and retain advisors. Our unique model allows us to invest more resources in our advisors, increasing their revenues and creating a virtuous cycle of growth. Since 2000, we have grown our net revenues at a 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). We are headquartered in Boston and currently have over 2,400 employees in our Boston, Charlotte and San Diego locations. Market Opportunity and Industry Background The market our advisors serve is significant and expanding. According to the Federal Reserve, U.S. household and non-profit organization financial assets totaled $45.1 trillion as of December 31, 2009, up from $41.7 trillion at December 31, 2008 and $38.9 trillion at December 31, 2004. In addition, according to Cerulli Associates, a research and consulting firm specializing in the financial services industry, $8.5 trillion of retail assets were professionally managed as of December 31, 2008, up from $6.8 trillion as of December 31, 2003. Finally, 58% of all U.S. households utilized a financial advisor in 2008. 1 Table of Contents Cerulli Associates divides the retail advisor market into six broad channels: the two independent channels that we serve (independent and registered investment advisors (RIAs)) and four employee model or captive channels (insurance, wirehouse, regional and bank). During the period from 2004 to 2008, the independent channels experienced substantial growth on both an absolute and relative basis, taking market share from the captive channels. According to Cerulli Associates, the independent channels market share by number of advisors increased from 40% in 2004 to 43% in 2008. In 2008, over 132,000 independent financial advisors managed $2.7 trillion in client assets, representing 33% of total retail advisor client assets. Cerulli Associates forecasts that total U.S. assets under management will grow 29% from 2008 to 2012 due to factors such as the retirement of the baby boomer generation as well as the continued growth of individual retirement account rollovers. During the same period, Cerulli Associates estimates that the independent channels market share by number of advisors will grow by seven percentage points to 50%, and market share by client assets will grow six percentage points to 39%. We believe there are several key factors driving the growth of the independent channels. Investors in the mass affluent market, and increasingly in the high net worth market, are seeking unbiased, conflict-free advice. The number of advisors electing to leave the large financial institutions to become independent financial advisors has accelerated over the last several years in part because of the ongoing consolidation among the captive platforms, particularly among the wirehouses. Finally, many advisors have entrepreneurial aspirations and are attracted to the flexibility, control and compelling economics inherent in the independent financial advisor model. Our Business With our focus and scale, we are not only a beneficiary of the secular shift among advisors toward independence, but an active catalyst of this trend. Between 2004 and 2008, our number of advisors increased at a CAGR of 20%, while according to Cerulli Associates, the total number of advisors across all channels remained flat. We enable our advisors to provide their clients with high quality independent financial advice and investment solutions, and support our advisors in managing the complexity of their businesses by providing a leading integrated platform of technology and clearing services. We provide these services through an open architecture product platform with no proprietary manufactured products, which enables an unbiased, conflict-free environment. Our Financial Advisors For more than 20 years our Commitment Creed has been ingrained in our culture and reflects our singular focus on the advisors we serve. The size and growth of our business has benefited from this focus. Our advisor base has grown from 3,569 advisors in 2000 to 12,026 as of March 31, 2010, representing a CAGR in excess of 14%. Our advisor base includes independent financial advisors, RIAs and advisors at small and mid-sized financial institutions. Advisors that join us average over 15 years of industry experience. This substantial industry experience allows us to focus on enhancing our advisors businesses without the need for basic training or subsidizing advisors that are new to the industry. We are also rigorous in both our initial advisor screening and diligence as well as our ongoing monitoring through our internal risk management and compliance functions. Our independent advisors join us from a broad range of firms including wirehouses, regional and insurance broker-dealers, banks and other independent firms. Our flexible business platform allows our advisors to choose the most appropriate business model to support their clients, whether they conduct brokerage business, offer brokerage and fee-based services on our corporate RIA platforms or provide fee-based services through their own RIAs. Among our 12,000 advisors, we support over 2,400 advisors at over 750 banks and credit unions. We believe these financial institutions are drawn to our outsourcing solutions because we 2 Table of Contents provide the broad array of services advisors at these institutions need to be successful, allowing these institutions to focus their energy and capital on their core businesses. We also provide support to over 4,000 additional financial advisors who are affiliated and licensed with insurance companies. These outsourcing arrangements provide customized clearing, advisory platforms and technology solutions that enable financial advisors at these insurance companies to efficiently provide a breadth of services to their client base. Our Service Value Proposition The core of our business is dedicated to meeting the evolving needs of our advisors and providing the platform and tools to grow and enhance the profitability of their businesses. We support our advisors by providing front, middle and back-office solutions through the four pillars of our distinct value proposition:  Enabling Technology. We provide our technology and service to advisors through BranchNet, our proprietary, integrated technology platform that is server-based and web-accessed. Using the BranchNet workstation, our advisors effectively manage all critical aspects of their businesses while remaining highly efficient and responsive to their clients needs.  Comprehensive Clearing and Compliance Services. We custody and clear the majority of our advisors transactions, providing an enhanced advisor experience and expedited processing capabilities. Our self-clearing platform also enables us to serve a wider variety of advisors, including RIAs and dually-registered advisors (hybrid RIAs). We have made sizeable investments in our compliance offering to fully integrate these tools into our technology platform. Since 2000, our commitment of resources and focus on compliance have enabled us to maintain one of the best regulatory compliance records, based upon the number of regulatory events reported in FINRAs BrokerCheck Reports, among the five largest U.S. broker-dealers, ranked by number of advisors.  Practice Management Programs and Training. Our practice management programs help our advisors enhance and grow their businesses. Because of our scale, we are able to dedicate a large and experienced group of professionals that work with our advisors to build and better manage their business and client relationships through one-on-one consulting. In addition, we hold 140 conferences and group training events annually for the benefit of our advisors.  Independent Research. Our research team consists of over 25 professionals with an average of 12 years of industry experience, dedicated to providing unbiased, conflict-free advice. We provide our advisors with integrated access to comprehensive proprietary and third-party independent research on mutual funds, separate accounts, insurance and annuities, asset allocation strategies, financial markets and the economy, among other areas. Our Economic Value Proposition We offer a compelling economic value proposition that is a key factor in our ability to attract and retain advisors. The independent channels pay advisors a greater share of brokerage commissions and advisory fees than the captive channels  generally 80-90% compared to 30-50%. Because of our scale and efficient operating model, we offer our advisors the highest average payout ratios among the five largest U.S. broker-dealers, ranked by number of advisors. We believe our superior technology and service platforms enable our advisors to operate their practices at a lower cost than other independent advisors. As a result, we believe owners of practices associated with us earn meaningfully more pre-tax profit than owners of practices affiliated with other independent brokerage firms. We attribute this difference in profitability, in part, to lower fixed costs driven by the need for fewer staff at our associated practices. Finally, as business owners, independent advisors, unlike captive advisors, also have the opportunity to build equity in their own businesses. 3 Table of Contents Our Product Access We do not manufacture any financial products. Instead, we provide our advisors open architecture access to a large variety of commission, fee-based, cash and money market products and services. Our platform provides access to over 8,500 financial products, which are manufactured by over 400 product sponsors. Our product diligence group pre-screens all new products. As of March 31, 2010, advisory and brokerage assets totaled $285 billion, of which $81 billion was in advisory assets. In 2009, brokerage sales were over $28 billion, including over $10 billion in mutual funds and $14 billion in annuities. Advisory sales were $23 billion, which consisted primarily of mutual funds. As a result of this scale and significant distribution capabilities, we can offer leading products and services with attractive economics to our advisors. Our Financial Model We have a proven track record of strong financial performance. We have increased our annual Adjusted EBITDA for the past nine consecutive years with only two declines in annual revenue in 2001 and 2009, both in conjunction with major market downturns. We have experienced greater variability in our net income primarily due to amortization of purchased assets and interest expense from our senior secured credit facilities and subordinated notes, both a result of our leveraged buyout transaction in 2005, as well as acquisition integration and restructuring initiatives. As we demonstrated during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, our financial model has inherent resilience, and our overall financial performance is a function of the following favorable characteristics:  Diverse and Recurring Revenue. Our revenue stems from diverse sources, including commission and advisory fees as well as fees from product manufacturers, recordkeeping and cash sweep balances. A majority of our revenue is recurring and predictable in nature, and a significant proportion is not correlated with financial markets. Our revenue base is not concentrated by advisor, product or geography.  Variable Expenses. Our expenses are predominantly variable. They consist primarily of payouts to advisors, which are determined as a percentage of advisor-generated revenue. This percentage payout generally varies with advisor productivity, which is correlated to market performance. Our general and administrative expenses can be actively managed, as evidenced during the recent financial crisis.  Low Capital Requirements. We do not manufacture products, make markets, provide underwriting or engage in mortgage lending. As a result, our cash flow is not encumbered by capital intensive activities. In addition, we can reinvest the substantial free cash flows that we generate in our business. Our Competitive Strengths  Significant Scale and Market Leadership Position. We are the established leader in the independent advisor market, which is our core business focus. Our scale enables us to benefit from the following dynamics:  We actively reinvest in our leading technology platform and practice support, which further improves the productivity of our advisors.  As one of the largest distributors of financial products in the United States, we are able to obtain attractive economics from product manufacturers.  Among the five largest U.S. broker-dealers by number of advisors, we offer the highest average payout ratios to our advisors. 4 Table of Contents The combination of our ability to reinvest in the business and maintain highly competitive payout ratios allows us to attract and retain advisors successfully. This, in turn, drives our growth and leads to a virtuous cycle that reinforces our established scale advantage.  Unique Value Proposition for Independent Advisors. We believe we are the only company that offers a conflict-free, open architecture and scalable platform, which leads to greater economics for our advisors and allows them to build equity in their businesses. This generates a significant opportunity to attract and retain highly qualified advisors who are seeking independence.  Unique Value Proposition for Institutions. We provide solutions to financial institutions, such as regional banks, credit unions and insurers, who would otherwise find the technology, infrastructure and regulatory requirements associated with delivering financial advice to be cost-prohibitive.  Ability to Profitably Serve the Mass Affluent Market. We have designed and integrated all aspects of our platforms and services to profitably meet the needs of advisors who serve the mass affluent market. We believe there is an attractive opportunity in this market, in part because wirehouses have not historically focused on the mass affluent market. We believe our scale will sustain and strengthen our competitive advantage in the mass affluent market.  Ability to Serve a Broad Range of Advisor Models. As a result of our integrated technology platform and the resulting flexibility, we are able to attract and retain advisors from multiple channels, including wirehouses, regional broker-dealers and other independent broker-dealers. In addition, although we have grown through our focus on the mass affluent market, the breadth of our platform has facilitated growing penetration of the high net worth market. As of March 31, 2010 our advisors supported accounts with more than $1 million in assets that in the aggregate represented $42.2 billion in advisory and brokerage assets, or 15% of our total.  Experienced and Committed Senior Management Team. We have an experienced and committed senior management team that provides stable and long-standing leadership for our business. On average, our senior management has 26 years of industry experience. The management team is aligned with stockholders and holds significant equity ownership in the company. Our Sources of Growth We expect to increase our revenue and profitability by benefiting from favorable industry trends and by executing strategies to accelerate our growth beyond that of the broader markets in which we operate. Favorable Industry Trends  Growth in Investable Assets. According to Cerulli Associates, total assets under management in the United States are anticipated to grow at 7% per year over the next four years and retirement assets are expected to grow 8% from 2008 to 2014 (in part due to the retirement of the baby boomer generation and the resulting assets which are projected to flow out of retirement plans and into individual retirement accounts). In addition, individual retirement account rollovers are projected to almost double, growing from $3.6 trillion as of 2008 to $6.8 trillion by 2014.  Increasing Demand for Independent Financial Advice. Retail investors, particularly in the mass affluent market, are increasingly seeking financial advice from independent sources.  Advisor Migration to Independence. Independent channels are gaining market share from captive channels. We believe that we are not just a beneficiary of this secular shift, but an active catalyst in the movement to independence. 5 Table of Contents  Macroeconomic Trends. As the macroeconomic environment continues to stabilize, we anticipate an appreciation in asset prices and a rise in interest rates from current, historically low levels. We expect that our business will benefit from growth in advisory and brokerage assets as well as increasing asset-based and cash sweep fees. LPL-Specific Growth Opportunities  Attracting New Advisors to our Platform. We have only 3.8% market share of the approximately 310,000 financial advisors in the United States, according to Cerulli Associates, which provides us with significant opportunity to attract new advisors.  Ramp-up of Newly-Attracted Advisors. We predominately attract experienced advisors who have established practices. In our experience, it takes an average of three years for new advisors to re-establish their practices and associated revenues. This seasoning process creates accelerated growth of revenue from our new advisors.  Increasing Productivity of Existing Advisor Base. The productivity of our advisors increases over time as we enable them to add new clients, gain shares of their clients investable assets, and expand their existing practices with additional advisors. We facilitate these productivity improvements by helping our advisors better manage their practices in an increasingly complex environment.  Our Business Model has Inherent Economies of Scale. The largely fixed costs necessary to support our advisors deliver higher marginal profitability as our advisors client assets and our revenues grow. Historically, this dynamic has been demonstrated through the growth in our operating margins.  Opportunistic Pursuit of Acquisitions. We have a proven history of expanding our business through opportunistic acquisitions. In the past six years, we have successfully completed four transactions. Our scalable business model and operating platform make us an attractive acquirer in a fragmented market. Risks That We Face Our business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making an investment decision. These risks are discussed more fully in the Risk Factors section of this prospectus immediately following this prospectus summary. These risks include the following:  We depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced and productive advisors.  Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by market fluctuations and other economic factors.  Regulatory developments and our failure to comply with regulations could adversely affect our business by increasing our costs and exposure to litigation, affecting our reputation and making our business less profitable.  We operate in an intensely competitive industry, which could cause us to lose advisors and their assets, thereby reducing our revenues and net income.  We rely on technology in our business, and technology and execution failures could subject us to losses, litigation and regulatory actions.  Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and may limit our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs.  Investment funds affiliated with Hellman & Friedman LLC and TPG Capital will have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder approval and may have interests that differ from those of our other stockholders. 6 Table of Contents Recent Developments On May 24, 2010, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (our senior secured credit agreement) with our subsidiary, LPL Holdings, Inc., the lending institutions from time to time parties thereto, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, as Administrative Agent, and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as Collateral Agent, which amended and restated our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 18, 2007. We entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to raise an additional $580.0 million to redeem our senior unsecured subordinated notes due 2015. This transaction resulted in the reduction in our overall weighted average cost of interest. In addition, we extended the maturity of $500.0 million of our original term loan tranche to 2015 (the remaining balance of $317.1 million will mature on the original maturity date in 2013) and achieved greater flexibility to pay down our indebtedness in the future without penalty.

(UVEST) (acquired on January 2, 2007), Pacific Select Group, LLC (renamed LPL Investment Advisory Services Group, LLC) and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Mutual Service Corporation (MSC), Associated Financial Group, Inc. (AFG), Associated Securities Corp. (Associated), Associated Planners Investment Advisory, Inc. (APIA) and Waterstone Financial Group, Inc. (WFG) (MSC, AFG, Associated, APIA and WFG are collectively referred to herein as the Affiliated Entities) (acquired on June 20, 2007) and IFMG Securities, Inc., Independent Financial Marketing Group, Inc. and LSC Insurance Agency of Arizona, Inc. (collectively IFMG) (acquired on November 7, 2007). Consequently, the results of operations for 2009, 2008 and 2007 and three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 may not be directly comparable to prior periods. (2) On December 28, 2005, investment funds affiliated with Hellman & Friedman LLC and TPG Capital acquired a majority of our capital stake through a merger transaction. Activities as of December 28, 2005 and periods prior are those of the predecessor. (3) The unaudited pro forma net income per share gives effect to: (i) the recognition of $ million of share-based compensation expense based on the number of restricted shares issued under our Fifth Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Bonus Plan multiplied by the assumed initial public offering price net of the related tax benefit, (ii) the sale by us of shares of common stock (assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional shares) that we are offering at the assumed initial public offering price and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us and (iii) the use of proceeds from the sale by us of these shares to reduce amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities. For purposes of this calculation, the assumed initial public offering price is $ per share, which is the midpoint of the range listed on the cover page of this prospectus. (4) Total debt consists of our senior secured credit facilities, senior unsecured subordinated notes, revolving line of credit facility and bank loans payable. (5) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Some of these limitations are:  Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share do not reflect all cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;  Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs and  Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt. For a discussion of why we think these are useful measures of our operating performance, please see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Evaluate Growth. 10 Table of Contents The reconciliation from net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income for the periods presented is as follows (in thousands): For the Three Months For the Year Ended December 31, Ended March 31, Predecessor(2) 2010 2009 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 (unaudited) Net income $ 25,554 $ 14,797 $ 47,520 $ 45,496 $ 61,069 $ 33,642 $ 43,089 Loss from discontinued operations       26,200 Interest expense 24,336 25,941 100,922 115,558 122,817 125,103 1,388 Income tax expense 19,162 11,988 25,047 47,269 46,764 21,224 46,461 Depreciation and amortization 25,590 27,395 108,296 100,462 78,748 65,348 17,854 EBITDA $ 94,642 $ 80,121 $ 281,785 $ 308,785 $ 309,398 $ 245,317 $ 134,992 EBITDA Adjustments: Share-based compensation expense (a) $ 2,536 $ 1,225 $ 6,437 $ 4,160 $ 2,159 $ 2,878 $ 8,354 Acquisition and integration related expenses (b) 140 822 3,037 18,326 16,350 1,237 33,741 Restructuring and conversion costs (c) 7,979 (259 ) 64,658 15,122    Other (d) 160 39 151 3,778 1,172 (1,520 ) 11,830 Adjusted EBITDA $ 105,457 $ 81,948 $ 356,068 $ 350,171 $ 329,079 $ 247,912 $ 188,917 Net income $ 25,554 $ 14,797 $ 47,520 $ 45,496 $ 61,069 $ 33,642 $ 43,089 After-Tax: EBITDA Adjustments (e) 7,015 1,395 46,089 26,045 12,263 1,820 33,919 Amortization of purchased intangible assets (e)(f) 8,530 9,119 35,947 37,322 34,072 29,910 1,270 Adjusted Net Income $ 41,099 $ 25,311 $ 129,556 $ 108,863 $ 107,404 $ 65,372 $ 78,278 Adjusted Net Income per share (g) $ 0.42 $ 0.26 $ 1.32 $ 1.09 $ 1.08 $ 0.68 $ 0.82 Weighted average shares outstanding  diluted 98,945 97,959 98,494 100,334 99,099 96,159 95,555 (a) Represents share-based compensation for stock options awarded to employees and non-executive directors.

(d) Represents impairment charges in 2008 for our equity investment in Blue Frog Solutions, Inc. (Blue Frog) and in 2005 for our mortgage subsidiary Innovex Mortgage, Inc., which subsequently ceased operations on December 31, 2007, as well as other taxes and employment tax withholding related to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. (e) EBITDA Adjustments and amortization of purchased intangible assets have been tax effected using a federal rate of 35.0% and the applicable effective state rate which ranged from 3.90% to 4.71%, net of the federal tax benefit. (f) Represents amortization of intangible assets and software resulting from our 2005 leveraged buyout transaction and our 2007 acquisitions of UVEST, the Affiliated Entities and IFMG. (g) Represents Adjusted Net Income divided by weighted average number of shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. (6) Number of advisors is defined as those investment professionals who are licensed to do business with our broker-dealer subsidiaries. In 2009, we attracted record levels of new advisors due to the dislocation in the marketplace that impacted many of our competitors. This record recruitment was offset due to anticipated attrition related to the consolidation of the operations of the Affiliated Entities. Excluding this attrition, we added 750 net new advisors during 2009, representing 6.3% advisor growth. (7) Advisory and brokerage assets are comprised of assets that are custodied, networked and non-networked and reflect market movement in addition to new assets, inclusive of new business development and net of attrition. Non-networked assets was not available in 2005 and accordingly, advisory and brokerage assets is comprised of custodied and networked accounts. 11 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this prospectus, before deciding to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry We depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced and productive advisors. We derive a large portion of our revenues from commissions and fees generated by our advisors. Our ability to attract and retain experienced and productive advisors has contributed significantly to our growth and success, and our strategic plan is premised upon continued growth in the number of our advisors. If we fail to attract new advisors or to retain and motivate our current advisors, our business may suffer. The market for experienced and productive advisors is highly competitive, and we devote significant resources to attracting and retaining the most qualified advisors. In attracting and retaining advisors, we compete directly with a variety of financial institutions such as wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies and other independent broker-dealers. If we are not successful in attracting or retaining highly qualified advisors, we may not be able to recover the expense involved in attracting and training these individuals. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain the advisors needed to achieve our growth objectives. Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by market fluctuations and other economic factors. Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by market fluctuations and other economic factors. Significant downturns and volatility in equity and other financial markets have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. General economic and market factors can affect our commission and fee revenue. For example, a decrease in market levels can:  reduce new investments by both new and existing clients in financial products that are linked to the stock market, such as variable life insurance, variable annuities, mutual funds and managed accounts;  reduce trading activity, thereby affecting our brokerage commissions;  reduce the value of advisory and brokerage assets, thereby reducing asset-based fee income and  motivate clients to withdraw funds from their accounts, reducing advisory and brokerage assets, advisory fee revenue and asset-based fee income. In addition, because certain of our expenses are fixed, our ability to reduce them over short periods of time is limited, which could negatively impact our profitability. Significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability and financial condition. Our revenues are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates payable to us from banks participating in our cash sweep programs. In the current low interest rate environment, our revenue from our cash sweep program has declined and may decline further due to changes in interest rates or clients moving assets out of our cash sweep program. We may also be 12 Table of Contents limited in the amount we can reduce interest rates payable to clients in our cash sweep program and still offer a competitive return. Lack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial condition. Liquidity, or ready access to funds, is essential to our business. We expend significant resources investing in our business, in particular with respect to our technology and service platforms. In addition, we must maintain certain levels of required capital. As a result, reduced levels of liquidity could have a significant negative effect on us. Some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include:  illiquid or volatile markets;  diminished access to debt or capital markets or  unforeseen cash or capital requirements, adverse legal settlements or judgments (including, among others, risks associated with auction rate securities). The capital and credit markets continue to experience varying degrees of volatility and disruption. In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for businesses similar to ours. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be required to curtail our operations, and our business would suffer. Notwithstanding the self-funding nature of our operations, we may sometimes be required to fund timing differences arising from the delayed receipt of funds associated with the settlement of transactions in securities markets. Historically, these timing differences were funded either with internally generated cash flow or, if needed, with funds drawn under short-term borrowing facilities, including both committed unsecured lines of credit and uncommitted lines of credit secured by client securities. LPL Financial, one of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, utilizes uncommitted lines secured by client securities to fund margin loans and other client transaction-related timing differences. In the event current resources are insufficient to satisfy our needs, we may need to rely on financing sources such as bank debt. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as  market conditions;  the general availability of credit;  the volume of trading activities;  the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry;  our credit ratings and credit capacity and  the possibility that our stockholders, advisors or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long-or short-term financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating organizations take negative actions against us. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business. Such market conditions may limit our ability to satisfy statutory capital requirements, generate commission, fee and other market-related revenue to meet liquidity needs and access the capital necessary to grow our business. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue different types of capital than we would otherwise, less effectively deploy such capital or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. 13 Table of Contents If the counterparties to the derivative instruments we use to hedge our interest rate risk default, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate. We use derivative instruments to hedge our interest rate risk. If our counterparties fail to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments, our hedges of the interest rate risk will be ineffective. That failure could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows that could be material. A loss of our marketing relationships with manufacturers of financial products could harm our relationship with our advisors and, in turn, their clients. We operate on an open architecture product platform with no proprietary financial products. To help our advisors meet their clients needs with suitable investment options, we have relationships with most of the industry-leading providers of financial and insurance products. We have sponsorship agreements with some manufacturers of fixed and variable annuities and mutual funds that, subject to the survival of certain terms and conditions, may be terminated upon notice. If we lose our relationships with one or more of these manufacturers, our ability to serve our advisors and our business may be materially and adversely affected. Risks Related to Our Regulatory Environment Regulatory developments and our failure to comply with regulations could adversely affect our business by increasing our costs and exposure to litigation, affecting our reputation and making our business less profitable. Our business is subject to extensive U.S. regulation and supervision, including securities and investment advisory services. The securities industry in the United States is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws. Our broker-dealer subsidiary, LPL Financial, is:  registered as a broker-dealer with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), each of the 50 states, and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands;  registered as an investment advisor with the SEC;  a member of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA);  regulated by the Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC) with respect to the futures and commodities trading activities it conducts as an introducing broker and  a member of the Nasdaq Stock Market and the Chicago Stock Exchange. Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations (SROs), namely FINRA and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). The primary regulators of LPL Financial are FINRA, and for municipal securities, the MSRB. The CFTC has designated the National Futures Association (NFA) as LPL Financials primary regulator for futures and commodities trading activities. The SEC, FINRA, CFTC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), various securities and futures exchanges and other U.S. governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations. There can also be no assurance that other federal or state agencies will not attempt to further regulate our business. These legislative and regulatory initiatives may affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business model less profitable. Our ability to conduct business in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the laws, rules and regulations promulgated by federal regulatory bodies and the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Our ability to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit and reporting systems and procedures, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance, 14 Table of Contents audit and risk management personnel. While we have adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, these systems and procedures may not be fully effective, and there can be no assurance that regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with respect to our past or future compliance with applicable regulations. Our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally and, in particular, our advisors clients, including changes to the laws governing taxation (including the classification of independent contractor status of our advisors), electronic commerce, privacy and data protection. Failure to comply with new rules and regulations could subject us to regulatory actions or litigation and it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In addition, new rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct, modifications to our business practices, increased capital requirements or additional costs. We are subject to various regulatory ownership requirements, which, if not complied with, could result in the restriction of the ongoing conduct, growth, or even liquidation of parts of our business. The business activities that we may conduct are limited by various regulatory agencies. Our membership agreement with FINRA may be amended by application to include additional business activities. This application process is time-consuming and may not be successful. As a result, we may be prevented from entering new potentially profitable businesses in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, as a member of FINRA, we are subject to certain regulations regarding changes in control of our ownership. Rule 1017 of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) generally provides, among other things, that FINRA approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a change in our equity ownership that results in one person or entity directly or indirectly owning or controlling 25% or more of our equity capital. Similarly, the OCC imposes advance approval requirements for a change of control, and control is presumed to exist if a person acquires 10% or more of our common stock. These regulatory approval processes can result in delay, increased costs and/or impose additional transaction terms in connection with a proposed change of control, such as capital contributions to the regulated entity. As a result of these regulations, our future efforts to sell shares or raise additional capital may be delayed or prohibited. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements, which, if not complied with, could result in the restriction of the ongoing conduct, growth, or even liquidation of parts of our business. The SEC, FINRA, CFTC, OCC and NFA have extensive rules and regulations with respect to capital requirements. As a registered broker-dealer, LPL Financial is subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Uniform Net Capital Rule) and related SRO requirements. The CFTC and NFA also impose net capital requirements. The Uniform Net Capital Rule specifies minimum capital requirements that are intended to ensure the general soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. Because we are not a registered broker-dealer, we are not subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule. However, our ability to withdraw capital from our broker-dealer subsidiaries could be restricted, which in turn could limit our ability to fund operations, repay debt and redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock. A large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our present levels of business. Failure to comply with ERISA regulations could result in penalties against us. We are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) and Sections 4975(c)(1)(A), (B), (C) and (D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code), and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as we act as a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients or otherwise deal with benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose duties on persons who 15 Table of Contents are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit specified transactions involving ERISA plan clients (including, without limitation, employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans) and impose monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties against us that could have a material adverse effect on our business (or, in a worst case, severely limit the extent to which we could act as fiduciaries for any plans under ERISA). Risks Related to Our Competition We operate in an intensely competitive industry, which could cause us to lose advisors and their assets, thereby reducing our revenues and net income. We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, including competition for our advisors and their clients, from:  asset management firms;  commercial banks and thrift institutions;  insurance companies;  other clearing/custodial technology companies and  brokerage and investment banking firms. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of services, including financial products, across more markets. Some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the services they offer. For example, certain of our competitors only provide clearing services and consequently would not have any supervision or oversight liability relating to actions of their financial advisors. We believe that competition within our industry will intensify as a result of consolidation and acquisition activity and because new competitors face few barriers to entry. If we fail to continue to attract highly qualified advisors or advisors licensed with us leave us to pursue other opportunities, or if current or potential clients of our advisors decide to use one of their competitors, we could face a significant decline in market share, commission and fee revenues and net income. If we are required to increase our payout of commissions and fees to our advisors in order to remain competitive, our net income could be significantly reduced. Poor service or performance of the financial products that we offer or competitive pressures on pricing of such services or products may cause clients of our advisors to withdraw their assets on short notice. Clients of our advisors control their assets under management with us. Poor service or performance of the financial products that we offer or competitive pressures on pricing of such services or products may result in the loss of accounts. In addition, we must monitor the pricing of our services and financial products in relation to competitors and periodically may need to adjust commission and fee rates, interest rates on deposits and margin loans and other fee structures to remain competitive. Competition from other financial services firms, such as reduced commissions to attract clients or trading volume or higher deposit rates to attract client cash balances, could adversely impact our business. The decrease in revenue that could result from such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business. We face competition in attracting and retaining key talent. Our success and future growth depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. There is significant competition for qualified employees in the broker-dealer industry. We may not be able to retain our existing employees or fill new positions or vacancies created by 16 Table of Contents expansion or turnover. The loss or unavailability of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, our success depends upon the continued services of our key senior management personnel, including our executive officers and senior managers. The loss of one or more of our key senior management personnel, and the failure to recruit a suitable replacement or replacements, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Risks Related to Our Debt Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and may limit our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs. At March 31, 2010, we had total indebtedness of $1.4 billion. Following this initial public offering, we expect to have total indebtedness of $ . Our level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. It could also require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. In addition, our level of indebtedness may limit our flexibility in planning for changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance indebtedness obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, as discussed above, we are limited in the amount of capital that we can draw from our broker-dealer subsidiaries. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful or feasible. Our senior secured credit agreement restricts our ability to sell assets. Even if we could consummate those sales, the proceeds that we realize from them may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Furthermore, if an event of default were to occur with respect to our senior secured credit agreement or other indebtedness, our creditors could, among other things, accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness. In addition, as a result of reduced operating performance or weaker than expected financial condition, rating agencies could downgrade our senior unsecured subordinated notes, which would adversely affect the value of shares of our common stock. Our senior secured credit agreement permits us to incur additional indebtedness. Although our senior secured credit agreement contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as defined in our senior secured credit agreement. To the extent new debt or other obligations are added to our currently anticipated debt levels, the substantial indebtedness risks described above would increase. 17 Table of Contents Restrictions under certain of our indebtedness may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business. Certain of our indebtedness contain customary restrictions on our activities, including covenants that may restrict us from:  incurring additional indebtedness or issuing disqualified stock or preferred stock;  paying dividends on, redeeming or repurchasing our capital stock;  making investments or acquisitions;  creating liens;  selling assets;  restricting dividends or other payments to us;  guaranteeing indebtedness;  engaging in transactions with affiliates and  consolidating, merging or transferring all or substantially all of our assets. We are also required to meet specified financial ratios. These restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants will depend on our future performance, which may be affected by events beyond our control. If we violate any of these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, we would be in default under the applicable agreements and payment of the indebtedness could be accelerated. The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay that indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our indebtedness is in default for any reason, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the common stock and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. Provisions of our senior secured credit agreement could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party. Certain provisions of our senior secured credit agreement could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us, and any of our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a change of control, all indebtedness under our senior secured credit agreement may be accelerated and become due and payable. A potential acquirer may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase our outstanding indebtedness in connection with a change of control. Risks Related to Our Technology We rely on technology in our business, and technology and execution failures could subject us to losses, litigation and regulatory actions. Our business relies extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems. In addition to better serving our advisors and clients, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables firms like ours to reduce costs. Our continued success will depend, in part, upon:  our ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our systems; 18 Table of Contents  our ability to address the needs of our advisors and their clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands and  our ability to retain skilled information technology employees. Failure of our systems, which could result from events beyond our control, or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services, could result in financial losses, liability to clients and damage to our reputation. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, this could jeopardize our own, our advisors or their clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed, stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our own, our advisors or their clients, our counterparties or third parties operations. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured or are not fully covered through any insurance we maintain. The securities settlement process exposes us to risks that may expose our advisors and us to adverse movements in price. LPL Financial, one of our subsidiaries, provides clearing services and trade processing for our advisors and their clients and certain financial institutions. Broker-dealers that clear their own trades are subject to substantially more regulatory requirements than brokers that outsource these functions to third-party providers. Errors in performing clearing functions, including clerical, technological and other errors related to the handling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of clients, could lead to censures, fines or other sanctions imposed by applicable regulatory authorities as well as losses and liability in related lawsuits and proceedings brought by our advisors clients and others. Any unsettled securities transactions or wrongly executed transactions may expose our advisors and us to adverse movements in the prices of such securities. Our networks may be vulnerable to security risks. The secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations. As part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about clients of our advisors as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations. Our application service provider systems maintain and process confidential data on behalf of advisors and their clients, some of which is critical to our advisors business operations. If our application service provider systems are disrupted or fail for any reason, or if our systems or facilities are infiltrated or damaged by unauthorized persons, our advisors could experience data loss, financial loss, harm to reputation and significant business interruption. If such a disruption or failure occurs, we may be exposed to unexpected liability, advisors may withdraw their assets, our reputation may be tarnished and there could be a material adverse effect on our business. Our networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other security problems in the future. We rely on our advisors to comply with our policies and procedures to safeguard confidential data. The failure of our advisors to comply with such policies and procedures could result in the loss or wrongful use of their clients confidential information or other sensitive information. In addition, even if we and our advisors comply with our policies and procedures, persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our confidential information or clients 19 Table of Contents confidential information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Such loss or use could, among other things:  seriously damage our reputation;  allow competitors access to our proprietary business information;  subject us to liability for a failure to safeguard client data;  result in the termination of relationships with our advisors;  subject us to regulatory sanctions or burdens, based on the authority of the SEC and FINRA to enforce regulations regarding business continuity planning and  require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach. Failure to maintain technological capabilities, flaws in existing technology, difficulties in upgrading our technology platform or the introduction of a competitive platform could have a material adverse effect on our business. We depend on highly specialized and, in many cases, proprietary technology to support our business functions, including among others:  securities trading and custody;  portfolio management;  customer service;  accounting and internal financial processes and controls and  regulatory compliance and reporting. In addition, our continued success depends on our ability to effectively adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client, industry and regulatory demands. We might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive technology. For example, we believe that our technology platform, particularly our BranchNet system, is one of our competitive strengths, and our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological advancements required to meet the changing demands of our advisors. The emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing systems obsolete or uncompetitive. Any upgrades or expansions may require significant expenditures of funds and may also cause us to suffer system degradations, outages and failures. There cannot be any assurance that we will have sufficient funds to adequately update and expand our networks, nor can there be any assurance that any upgrade or expansion attempts will be successful and accepted by our current and prospective advisors. If our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could lead to a loss of advisors and could harm our reputation. A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our advisors and their clients. There cannot be any assurance that another company will not design a similar platform that affects our competitive advantage. Inadequacy or disruption of our disaster recovery plans and procedures in the event of a catastrophe could adversely affect our business. We have made a significant investment in our infrastructure, and our operations are dependent on our ability to protect the continuity of our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster, breach of security, loss of power, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made events. A catastrophic event could have a direct negative impact on us by adversely affecting our advisors, employees or facilities, or an indirect impact on us by adversely affecting the financial markets or the overall economy. While we have implemented business continuity and disaster 20 Table of Contents recovery plans and maintain business interruption insurance, it is impossible to fully anticipate and protect against all potential catastrophes. If our business continuity and disaster recovery plans and procedures were disrupted or unsuccessful in the event of a catastrophe, we could experience a material adverse interruption of our operations. We rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions. We rely on outsourced service providers to perform certain key technology, processing and support functions. For example, we have an agreement with Thomson Reuters BETA Systems, a division of Thomson Reuters, under which they provide us operational support, including data processing services for securities transactions and back office processing support. Any significant failures by these service providers could cause us to incur losses and could harm our reputation. If we had to change these service providers, we would experience a disruption to our business. Although we believe we have the resources to make such transitions with minimal disruption, we cannot predict the costs and time for such conversions. We cannot provide any assurance that the disruption caused by a change in our service providers would not have a material adverse affect on our business. Risks Related to Our Business Generally Any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income. We have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity and superior client service, which is built upon our four pillars of support for our advisors: enabling technology, comprehensive clearing and compliance services, practice management programs and training, and independent research. Our ability to attract and retain advisors and employees is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our level of service, business practices and financial condition. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects and may arise from numerous sources, including:  litigation or regulatory actions;  failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality;  compliance failures and  unethical behavior and the misconduct of employees, advisors or counterparties. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing and potential advisors and employees. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. These occurrences could lead to loss of revenue and net income. Our business is subject to risks related to litigation, arbitration actions and governmental and SRO investigations. We are subject to legal proceedings arising out of our business operations, including lawsuits, arbitration claims, regulatory, governmental or SRO subpoenas, investigations and actions and other claims. Many of our legal claims are client initiated and involve the purchase or sale of investment securities. In our investment advisory programs, we have fiduciary obligations that require us and our advisors to act in the best interests of our advisors clients. We may face liabilities for actual or alleged breaches of legal duties to our advisors clients, in respect of issues related to the suitability of the financial products we make available in our open architecture product platform or the investment advice of our advisors based on their clients investment objectives (including, for example, auction rate securities or exchange traded funds). In addition, we, along with other industry participants, are subject to risks related to litigation and settlements arising from market events such as the failures in the auction rate securities market. We may also become subject to claims, allegations and legal 21 Table of Contents proceedings that we infringe or misappropriate intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others. The outcome of any such actions cannot be predicted, and a negative outcome in such a proceeding could result in substantial legal liability, loss of intellectual property rights and injunctive or other equitable relief against us. Further, such outcome may cause us significant reputational harm and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risks. We have adopted policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage our operational risk. These policies and procedures, however, may not be fully effective. Some of our risk evaluation methods depend upon information provided by others and public information regarding markets, clients or other matters that are otherwise accessible by us. In some cases, however, that information may not be accurate, complete or up-to-date. Also, because our advisors work in small, decentralized offices, additional risk management challenges may exist. If our policies and procedures are not fully effective or we are not always successful in capturing all risks to which we are or may be exposed, we may suffer harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation or regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Misconduct and errors by our employees and our advisors, who operate in a decentralized-environment, could harm our business. Misconduct and errors by our employees and our advisors could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm. We cannot always prevent misconduct and errors by our employees and our advisors, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective in all cases. Prevention and detection among our advisors, who are not our direct employees and some of whom tend to be located in small, decentralized offices, present additional challenges. There cannot be any assurance that misconduct and errors by our employees and advisors will not lead to a material adverse effect on our business. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate or expensive. We are subject to claims in the ordinary course of business. These claims may involve substantial amounts of money and involve significant defense costs. It is not always possible to prevent or detect activities giving rise to claims, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. We maintain voluntary and required insurance coverage, including, among others, general liability, property, director and officer, excess-SIPC, business interruption, errors and omissions, excess entity errors and omissions and fidelity bond insurance. Recently, premium and deductible costs associated with certain insurance coverages have increased, coverage terms have become more restrictive and the number of insurers has decreased. While we endeavor to purchase coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of our risk, we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency, nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages. Our business may be negatively affected if in the future our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable. In addition, insurance claims may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments. We may seek to opportunistically acquire businesses that offer complementary products, services or technologies. These acquisitions are accompanied by risks. For instance, the acquisition could have a negative effect on our financial and strategic position and reputation or the acquired business could fail to further our strategic goals. We could incur significant costs when integrating an 22 Table of Contents acquired business and may not be successful in doing so. We may have a lack of experience in new markets, products or technologies brought on by the acquisition and we may have an initial dependence on unfamiliar supply or distribution partners. The acquisition may create an impairment of relationships with customers or suppliers of the acquired business or our advisors or suppliers. All of these and other potential risks may serve as a diversion of our managements attention from other business concerns and any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes in U.S. federal income tax law could make some of the products distributed by our advisors less attractive to clients. Some of the financial products distributed by our advisors, such as variable annuities, enjoy favorable treatment under current U.S. federal income tax law. Changes in U.S. federal income tax law, in particular with respect to variable annuity products or with respect to tax rates on capital gains or dividends, could make some of these products less attractive to clients and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Risks Related to this Offering and Ownership of Our Common Stock The Majority Holders will have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder approval and may have interests that differ from those of our other stockholders. Investment funds affiliated with Hellman & Friedman LLC and TPG Capital (collectively, the Majority Holders), own a majority of our capital stock, on a fully-diluted basis, as of March 31, 2010. After the completion of this offering, the Majority Holders will own approximately % of our common stock, or % on a fully diluted basis. The Majority Holders have significant influence over corporate transactions. So long as investment funds associated with or designated by the Majority Holders continue to own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, the Majority Holders will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions, regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that the transaction is in their own best interests. Such concentration of voting power could also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. If the Majority Holders enter into a change-in-control transaction our executive team does not approve, certain members of our executive team have the contractual ability to terminate their employment agreements within a short period after such event and receive severance payments. In addition, the Majority Holders and their affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time in the future, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. To the extent the Majority Holders invest in such other businesses, the Majority Holders may have differing interests than our other stockholders. The Majority Holders may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. An active trading market for our common stock may not develop. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. Although we plan to apply to have our common stock listed on the , an active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained following this offering. If the market does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock at a price that is attractive to you or at all. In addition, an inactive market may impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies by using our shares as consideration, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business. 23 Table of Contents The price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for investors purchasing shares in this offering. The initial public offering price for the shares of our common stock sold in this offering will be determined by negotiation between the representatives of the underwriters and us. This price may not reflect the market price of our common stock following this offering. In addition, the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to the following factors (in addition to the other risk factors described in this section):  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;  variance in our financial performance from the expectations of equity research analysts;  conditions and trends in the markets we serve;  announcements of significant new services or products by us or our competitors;  additions or changes to key personnel;  the commencement or outcome of litigation;  changes in market valuation or earnings of our competitors;  the trading volume of our common stock;  future sale of our equity securities;  changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets;  legislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions and  general economic conditions. In addition, the stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance. As a result of these factors, you might be unable to resell your shares at or above the initial public offering price after this offering. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company. This type of litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources. We currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates. Following the completion of this offering, we do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, our senior secured credit agreement places substantial restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, if you purchase shares in this offering, realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock. Please see the section titled Dividend Policy for additional information. 24 Table of Contents Upon expiration of lock-up agreements between the underwriters and our officers, directors and certain holders of our common stock, a substantial number of shares of our common stock could be sold into the public market shortly after this offering, which could depress our stock price. Our officers, directors and certain holders of our common stock have entered into lock-up agreements with our underwriters which prohibit, subject to certain limited exceptions, the disposal or pledge of, or the hedging against, any of their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock for a period through the date 180 days after the date of this prospectus, subject to extension in certain circumstances. In addition, certain holders who receive shares of common stock upon vesting of their restricted stock in connection with the initial public offering will be restricted from transferring such shares until the earlier of 180 days after the initial public offering and March 15, 2011. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders in the market after this offering and after the expiration of these lock-up periods, or the perception that these sales could occur. Once a trading market develops for our common stock, and after these lock-up periods expire, many of our stockholders will have an opportunity to sell their stock for the first time. These factors could also make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock. Please see the section titled Shares Eligible for Future Sale for additional information regarding these factors. As a new investor, you will incur immediate and substantial dilution as a result of this offering. The initial public offering price of our common stock will be substantially higher than the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, if you purchase shares of our common stock at the assumed initial public offering price (the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus), you will incur immediate and substantial dilution of $ per share. If the holders of outstanding options or warrants exercise those options or warrants, you will suffer further dilution. Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds we receive in this offering and might not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment. Our management will have broad discretion to use the net proceeds from this offering, and you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these proceeds. They might not apply the net proceeds of this offering in ways that increase the value of your investment. We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the term loans under our senior secured credit facilities. Our management might not be able to yield any return on the investment and use of these net proceeds. You will not have the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use the proceeds. Anti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prevent or delay a change in control of our company. Our certificate of incorporation, which will be in effect as of the closing of this offering, includes a provision similar to the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. We have exempted transactions with the Majority Holders or with certain transferees of their shares. For more information, please see the section titled Description of Capital Stock  Anti-takeover Effects of the Delaware General Corporation Law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. In addition, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which will be in effect as of the closing of this offering, may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable, including the following, 25 Table of Contents some of which may only become effective when our Majority Holders collectively own less than 40% of our outstanding common stock:  the division of our board of directors into three classes and the election of each class for three-year terms;  the sole ability of the board of directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors;  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations;  limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and to take action by written consent;  the required approval of holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws, or amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation;  the required approval of holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of the directors to remove directors and, following the classification of the board of directors, removal only for cause;  provisions that reproduce much of the effect of DGCL Section 203 to limit the ability of interested stockholders (other than the Majority Holders and certain of their transferees) from engaging in specified business combinations with us absent prior approval of the board of directors or holders of 66 2 / 3 % of our voting stock and  the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock, without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a rights plan, or a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership or a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in the acquisition. For more information, please see the section titled Description of Capital Stock. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We may not obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock could be negatively impacted. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us publishes unfavorable research or reports or downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. 26 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus, including the sections titled Prospectus Summary, Risk Factors, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Business, and the documents incorporated by reference contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements convey our current expectations or forecasts of future events. All statements contained in this prospectus other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected costs, plans and objectives of management for future operations. The words may, might, should, predict, potential, continue, estimate, intend, plan, will, believe, project, expect, seek, anticipate and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this prospectus may turn out to be inaccurate. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements including, but not limited to, changes in general economic and financial market conditions, fluctuations in the value of assets under management, effects of competition in the financial services industry, changes in the number of our advisors and their ability to effectively market financial products and services, the effect of current, pending and future legislation and regulation and regulatory actions. In particular, you should consider the numerous risks described in the Risk Factors section of this prospectus. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this prospectus may not occur as contemplated, and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not unduly rely on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this prospectus. Unless required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect new information or future events or otherwise. You should, however, review the factors and risks we describe in the reports we will file from time to time with the SEC after the date of this prospectus. See Where You Can Find Additional Information. 27 Table of Contents USE OF PROCEEDS We estimate that the net proceeds of the sale of the common stock that we are offering will be approximately $ million, or $ million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, assuming an initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the range listed on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders. We expect to use approximately $ million of the net proceeds from this offering received by us to repay a portion of the term loans under our senior secured credit facilities. We currently have three term loan tranches under our senior secured credit facilities  a term loan tranche of $317.1 million maturing on June 28, 2013 (the 2013 Term Loans), a term loan tranche of $500.0 million maturing on June 25, 2015 (the 2015 Term Loans) and a term loan tranche of $580.0 million maturing on June 28, 2017 (the 2017 Term Loans). The applicable margin for borrowings with respect to the (a) 2013 Term Loans is currently 0.75% for base rate borrowings and 1.75% for LIBOR borrowings, (b) 2015 Term Loans is currently 1.75% for base rate borrowings and 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings, and (c) 2017 Term Loans is currently 2.75% for base rate borrowings and 3.75% for LIBOR borrowings. We have not yet determined how we will allocate the reduction of indebtedness among our term loan tranches. Management will retain broad discretion in the allocation and use of the net proceeds to us from this offering, and determine the allocation of the net proceeds to repay indebtedness following the completion of this offering based on a number of factors, including remaining maturity, applicable interest rates, outstanding balance and ability to reborrow. 28 Table of Contents DIVIDEND POLICY We have not paid any dividends on our common stock during the past four fiscal years and we do not currently anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance operations and repay debt. Certain of our indebtedness contains restrictions on our activities, including paying dividends on our capital stock and restricting dividends or other payments to us. Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including future earnings, capital requirements, financial conditions, future prospects, contractual restrictions and covenants and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. 29 Table of Contents CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our capitalization as of March 31, 2010:  on an actual basis;  on an as-adjusted basis to give effect to (i) the addition of a new $580.0 million term loan tranche of our senior secured credit facilities on May 24, 2010, (ii) the redemption of the $550.0 million senior unsecured subordinated notes at a price of 105.375% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest through March 31, 2010, (iii) the payment in cash of fees and costs totaling $18.0 million associated with the new term loan tranche and (iv) the after-tax impact to retained earnings of the loss on the early retirement of the senior unsecured subordinated notes of $22.9 million, and  on a pro forma as-adjusted basis after giving effect to (i) the adjustments described above, (ii) the recognition of $ million of share-based compensation expense based on the number of restricted shares issued under our Fifth Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Bonus Plan multiplied by the assumed initial public offering price net of the related tax benefit, (iii) the sale by us of shares of common stock (assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional shares) that we are offering at the assumed initial public offering price and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us and (iv) the use of proceeds from the sale by us of these shares to reduce amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities.

(acquired on January 2, 2007), Pacific Select Group, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Mutual Service Corporation, Associated Financial Group, Inc., Associated Securities Corp., Associated Planners Investment Advisory, Inc. and Waterstone Financial Group, Inc. (acquired on June 20, 2007) and IFMG Securities, Inc., Independent Financial Marketing Group, Inc. and LSC Insurance Agency of Arizona, Inc. (acquired on November 7, 2007). Consequently, the results of operations for 2009, 2008 and 2007 and three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 may not be directly comparable to prior periods. (2) On December 28, 2005, investment funds affiliated with Hellman & Friedman LLC and TPG Capital acquired a majority of our capital stock through a merger transaction. Activities as of December 28, 2005 and periods prior are those of the predecessor. (3) The unaudited pro forma net income per share gives effect to: (i) the recognition of $ million of share-based compensation expense based on the number of restricted shares issued under our Fifth Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Bonus Plan multiplied by the assumed initial public offering price net of the related tax benefit, (ii) the sale by us of shares of common stock (assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional shares) that we are offering at the assumed initial public offering price and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us and (iii) the use of proceeds from the sale by us of these shares to reduce amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities. For purposes of this calculation, the assumed initial public offering price is $ per share, which is the midpoint of the range listed on the cover page of this prospectus. (4) Total debt consists of our senior secured credit facilities, senior unsecured subordinated notes, revolving line of credit facility and bank loans payable. (5) See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Evaluate Growth for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share. (6) Gross margin is calculated as net revenues less production expenses. Production expenses consist of commissions and advisory fees as well as brokerage, clearing and exchange fees. (7) Number of advisors is defined as those investment professionals who are licensed to do business with our broker-dealer subsidiaries. (8) Advisory and brokerage assets are comprised of assets that are custodied, networked and non-networked and reflect market movement in addition to new assets, inclusive of new business development and net of attrition. Non-networked assets was not available in 2005 and accordingly, advisory and brokerage assets is comprised of custodied and networked accounts. 34 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this prospectus, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Overview We provide an integrated platform of proprietary technology, brokerage and investment advisory services to over 12,000 independent financial advisors and financial advisors at financial institutions across the country, enabling them to successfully service their retail investors with unbiased, conflict-free financial advice. In addition, we support over 4,000 financial advisors with customized clearing, advisory platforms and technology solutions. Our singular focus is to support our advisors with the front, middle and back-office support they need to serve the large and growing market for independent investment advice, particularly in the mass affluent market. We believe we are the only company that offers advisors the unique combination of an integrated technology platform, comprehensive self-clearing services and full open architecture access to leading financial products, all delivered in an environment unencumbered by conflicts from product manufacturing, underwriting or market making. Our Sources of Revenue Our revenues are derived primarily from fees and commissions from products and advisory services offered by our advisors to their clients, a substantial portion of which we pay out to our advisors, as well as fees we receive from our advisors for use of our technology, custody and clearing platforms. We also generate asset-based fees through a distribution of financial products for a broad range of product manufacturers. Under our self-clearing platform, we custody the majority of client assets invested in these financial products, which includes providing statements, transaction processing and ongoing account management. In return for these services, mutual funds, insurance companies, banks and other financial product manufacturers pay us fees based on asset levels or number of accounts managed. We also earn fees for margin lending to our advisors clients. 35 Table of Contents The table below summarizes the sources of our revenue and the underlying drivers:  Commissions and Advisory Fees. Transaction-based commissions and advisory fees both represent advisor-generated revenue, generally 85-90% of which is paid to advisors. Commissions. Transaction-based commission revenues represent gross commissions generated by our advisors, primarily from commissions earned on the sale of various financial products such as fixed and variable annuities, mutual funds, general securities, alternative investments and insurance. We also earn trailing commission type revenues (a commission that is paid over time such as 12(b)-1 fees) on mutual funds and variable annuities held by clients of our advisors. Trail commissions are recurring in nature and are earned based on the current market value of investment holdings. Advisory Fees. Advisory fee revenues represent fees charged by us and our advisors to their clients based on the value of advisory assets.  Asset-Based Fees. Asset-based fees are comprised of fees from cash sweep vehicles, our financial product manufacturer sponsorship programs, and sub-transfer agency and networking services. Pursuant to contractual arrangements, uninvested cash balances in our advisors client accounts are swept into either insured deposit accounts at various banks or third-party money market funds, for which we receive fees, including administrative and record-keeping fees based on account type and the invested balances. In addition, we receive fees from certain financial product manufacturers in connection with sponsorship programs that support our marketing and sales-force education and training efforts. We also earn fees on mutual fund assets for which we provide administrative and record-keeping services as a sub-transfer agent. Our networking fees represent fees paid to us by mutual fund and annuity product manufacturers in exchange for administrative and record-keeping services that we provide to 36 Table of Contents clients of our advisors. Networking fees are correlated to the number of positions we administer, not the value of assets under administration.  Transaction and Other Fees. Revenues earned from transaction and other fees primarily consist of transaction fees and ticket charges, subscription fees, IRA custodian fees, contract and license fees, conference fees and small/inactive account fees. We charge fees to our advisors and their clients for executing transactions in brokerage and fee-based advisory accounts. We earn subscription fees for the software and technology services provided to our advisors and on IRA custodial services that we provide for their client accounts. We charge monthly administrative fees to our advisors. We charge fees to financial product manufacturers for participating in our training and marketing conferences and fees to our advisors and their clients for accounts that fail to meet certain specified thresholds of size or activity.  Interest and Other Revenue. Other revenue includes marketing re-allowances from certain financial product manufacturers as well as interest income from client margin accounts and cash equivalents, net of operating interest expense. Our Operating Expenses  Production Expenses. Production expenses consist of commissions and advisory fees as well as brokerage, clearing and exchange fees. We pay out the majority of commissions and advisory fees received from sales or services provided by our advisors. Substantially all of these payouts are variable and correlated to the revenues generated by each advisor.  Compensation and Benefits Expense. Compensation and benefits expense includes salaries and wages and related employee benefits and taxes for our employees (including share-based compensation), as well as compensation for temporary employees and consultants.  General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include promotional fees, occupancy and equipment, communications and data processing, regulatory fees, travel and entertainment and professional services.  Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense represents the benefits received for using long-lived assets. Those assets represent significant intangible assets established through our acquisitions, as well as fixed assets which include internally developed software, hardware, leasehold improvements and other equipment.  Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges represent expenses incurred as a result of our 2009 consolidation of the Affiliated Entities and our strategic business review committed to and implemented in 2008 to reduce our cost structure and approve operating efficiencies.  Other Expenses. Other expenses include bank fees, other taxes, bad debt expense and other miscellaneous expenses. How We Evaluate Growth We focus on several key financial and non-financial metrics in evaluating the success of our business relationships and our resulting financial position and operating performance. Our key metrics 37 Table of Contents as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 and the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows: As of and for the Three Months As of and for the Year Ended March 31, Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2009 2008 2007 (unaudited) Non-Financial Metrics Advisors(1) 12,026 12,294 11,950 11,920 11,089 Advisory and brokerage assets(2) (in billions) $ 284.6 $ 231.7 $ 279.4 $ 233.9 $ 283.2 Advisory assets under management (in billions) $ 81.0 $ 57.5 $ 77.2 $ 59.6 $ 73.9 Financial Metrics Revenue growth (decline) from prior period 15.6 % (19.5 )% (11.8 )% 14.7 % 56.2 % Recurring revenue as a % of net revenue(3) 60.1 % 55.0 % 57.3 % 58.5 % 57.1 % Gross margin(4) (in millions) $ 230.2 $ 200.4 $ 844.9 $ 953.3 $ 781.1 Gross margin as a % of net revenue(4) 31.0 % 31.2 % 30.7 % 30.6 % 28.8 % Net income (in millions) $ 25.6 $ 14.8 $ 47.5 $ 45.5 $ 61.1 Adjusted EBITDA (in millions) $ 105.5 $ 81.9 $ 356.1 $ 350.2 $ 329.1 Adjusted Net Income (in millions) $ 41.1 $ 25.3 $ 129.6 $ 108.9 $ 107.4 (1) Advisors are defined as those investment professionals who are licensed to do business with our broker-dealer subsidiaries. In 2009, we attracted record levels of new advisors due to the dislocation in the marketplace that impacted many of our competitors. This record recruitment was offset due to anticipated attrition related to the consolidation of the operations of the Affiliated Entities. Excluding this attrition, we added 750 net new advisors during 2009, representing 6.3% advisor growth. (2) Advisory and brokerage assets are comprised of assets that are custodied, networked and non-networked and reflect market movement in addition to new assets, inclusive of recruiting and net of attrition. (3) Recurring revenue is derived from sources such as advisory fees, asset-based fees, trailing commission fees, fees related to our cash sweep programs, interest earned on margin accounts and technology and service fees. In 2009, we revised our definition of recurring revenues. Accordingly, prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change. (4) Gross margin is calculated as net revenues less production expenses, which include commissions and advisory fees as well as brokerage, clearing and exchange fees. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization), further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges and other adjustments set forth below. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it an important measure of our performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a useful financial metric in assessing our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business, such as certain material non-cash items and other adjustments that we do not expect to continue in the future and are outside the control of management. 38 Table of Contents We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our reported GAAP results, provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations for the following reasons:  because non-cash equity grants made to employees at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time, stock-based compensation expense is not a key measure of our operating performance and  because costs associated with acquisitions and the resulting integrations, restructuring and conversions can vary from period to period and transaction to transaction, expenses associated with these activities are not considered a key measure of our operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA:  as a measure of operating performance;  for planning purposes, including the preparation of budgets and forecasts;  to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business;  to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies;  in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance and  as a bonus target for certain of our employees. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure as defined by Regulation G under the Securities Act and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The term Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income, operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and is subject to important limitations. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:  Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;  Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs and  Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental information. 39 Table of Contents Set forth below is a reconciliation from our net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands): For the Three Months Ended March 31, For The Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2009 2008 2007 (unaudited) Net income $ 25,554 $ 14,797 $ 47,520 $ 45,496 $ 61,069 Interest expense 24,336 25,941 100,922 115,558 122,817 Income tax expense 19,162 11,988 25,047 47,269 46,764 Depreciation and amortization 25,590 27,395 108,296 100,462 78,748 EBITDA $ 94,642 $ 80,121 $ 281,785 $ 308,785 $ 309,398 Share-based compensation expense(a) $ 2,536 $ 1,225 $ 6,437 $ 4,160 $ 2,159 Acquisition and integration related expenses(b) 140 822 3,037 18,326 16,350 Restructuring and conversion costs(c) 7,979 (259 ) 64,658 15,122  Other(d) 160 39 151 3,778 1,172 Adjusted EBITDA $ 105,457 $ 81,948 $ 356,068 $ 350,171 $ 329,079 (a) Represents share-based compensation for stock options awarded to employees and non-executive directors. (b) Represents acquisition and integration costs primarily as a result of our 2007 acquisitions of UVEST, the Affiliated Entities and IFMG. (c) Represents organizational restructuring charges incurred in 2008 and 2009 for severance and one-time termination benefits, asset impairments, lease and contract termination fees and other transfer costs. (d) Represents impairment charges in 2008 for our equity investment in Blue Frog, other taxes and employment tax withholding related to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share Adjusted Net Income represents net income before: (a) share-based compensation expense, (b) amortization of intangible assets and software resulting from our 2005 leveraged buy-out transaction and our 2007 acquisitions, (c) acquisition and integration related expenses and (d) restructuring and conversion costs. Reconciling items are tax effected using the income tax rates in effect for the applicable period, adjusted for any potentially non-deductible amounts. Adjusted Net Income per share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by weighted average outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis. We prepared Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share to eliminate the effects of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. 40 Table of Contents We believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share, viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our reported GAAP results provide useful information to investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations for the following reasons:  because non-cash equity grants made to employees at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time, stock-based compensation expense is not a key measure of our operating performance;  because costs associated with acquisitions and related integrations, restructuring and conversions can vary from period to period and transaction to transaction, expenses associated with these activities are not considered a key measure of our operating performance and  because amortization expenses can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon each companys financing and accounting methods, the fair value and average expected life of acquired intangible assets and the method by which assets were acquired, the amortization of intangible assets obtained in acquisitions are not considered a key measure in comparing our operating performance. We have historically not used Adjusted Net Income for internal management reporting and evaluation purposes; however, we believe Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts use them as supplemental measures to evaluate the overall performance of companies, and we anticipate that our investor and analyst presentations after we are public will include Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share are not measures of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or earnings per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our profitability or liquidity. We understand that, although Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share are frequently used by securities analysts and others in their evaluation of companies, they have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share in isolation, or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In particular you should consider:  Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;  Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs and  Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share through disclosure of such limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP and reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income. 41 Table of Contents The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share on our historical results: For the Three Months Ended March 31, For The Year Ended 2010 2009 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands, except per share data) (unaudited) Net income $ 25,554 $ 14,797 $ 47,520 $ 45,496 $ 61,069 After-Tax: EBITDA Adjustments(1) 7,015 1,395 46,089 26,045 12,263 Amortization of purchased intangible assets(2) 8,530 9,119 35,947 37,322 34,072 Adjusted Net Income $ 41,099 $ 25,311 $ 129,556 $ 108,863 $ 107,404 Adjusted Net Income per share(3) $ 0.42 $ 0.26 $ 1.32 $ 1.09 $ 1.08 Weighted average shares outstanding  diluted 98,945 97,959 98,494 100,334 99,099 (1) EBITDA Adjustments and amortization of purchased intangible assets have been tax effected using a federal rate of 35.0% and the applicable effective state rate which ranged from 4.23% to 4.71%, net of the federal tax benefit.

Economic Overview and Impact of Financial Market Events During the first quarter of 2010, the equity and fixed income markets continued the positive trends that were observed toward the second half of 2009. For example, the S&P 500 averaged 1,124 during the first quarter of 2010, 39.1% above the average of 808 in the comparable prior year period. This rebound has positively influenced our advisory and brokerage assets and improved those revenue sources which are directly driven by client asset levels. Despite the markets trending recovery, overall economic activity including consumer discretionary income, employment and consumer confidence remained weak. In response to the market turbulence and overall economic environment, the central banks including the Federal Reserve have maintained historically low interest rates. The average effective rate for federal funds was 0.13% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to 0.12% for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 0.19% for the first quarter of 2009. The low interest rate environment negatively impacts our revenues from client assets in our cash sweep programs. While our business has improved as a result of the more favorable environment, our outlook remains cautiously optimistic and we persist in our efforts to reduce costs and control our expenditures. Throughout 2008 and 2009, we launched a series of expense management and organizational simplification initiatives that enabled us to reduce compensation and benefits expenses and other general and administrative expenses from 2008 to 2009 by $72.7 million and $48.0 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we initiated a series of cost reduction measures through a strategic business review. Those efforts included the December 31, 2008 decision to reduce our workforce by approximately 250 employees, or approximately 10%, which resulted in additional 42 Table of Contents expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2008 and reduced compensation and benefits expense by approximately $27.0 million during 2009 in comparison to 2008. In addition, the strategic business review included expense reductions that we view as temporary in nature. These items include (a) decreases in project expenses, (b) the elimination of or reduction in scope of certain advisor recognition programs and annual conferences and (c) employee-related items such as reduction in bonuses and employer contributions to our retirement plans. In the third quarter of 2009, we furthered our restructuring plans by consolidating the operations of Pacific Select Group, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, which we refer to collectively as the Affiliated Entities, with those of LPL Financial. We also identified opportunities to restructure and consolidate certain advisor support activities, including sales and marketing and compliance across certain of our subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2010, we have incurred charges of $63.1 million and expect $10.6 million in additional one-time restructuring charges, all for severance and termination benefits, asset impairments, contract termination fees and other conversion costs. Beginning in 2010, we estimate the 2009 consolidation of our Affiliated Entities will result in approximately $24.0 million of annual cost savings. We also enjoyed strong business development results in 2009 as market turbulence resulted in a significant dislocation of advisors at firms disrupted by or forced to merge in response to these adverse market conditions. In 2009, we attracted 750 net new advisors, exclusive of the attrition of those advisors impacted by our consolidation of the operations of the Affiliated Entities. We continue to attempt to mitigate the impact of financial market events on our earnings with a strategic focus on attractive growth opportunities such as business development from attracting new advisors and through efficiency initiatives and expense management activities described earlier. We plan to continue these efforts into future periods as they may help mitigate some of the negative financial risks associated with volatile market conditions and bolster our growth capabilities. We remain focused on retaining our advisors and enabling them to provide their clients with independent and unbiased financial advice and leading service. This strategy is a key advantage and we believe it provides sustainable success for our advisors and our company. Recent Acquisitions and Divestitures From time to time we undertake acquisitions and/or divestitures based on opportunities in the competitive landscape. These activities are part of our overall growth strategy, but can distort comparability when reviewing revenue and expense trends for periods presented. The following describes significant acquisition and divestiture activities that have impacted our 2007, 2008 and 2009 results. On January 2, 2007, we completed our acquisition of UVEST, augmenting our position in providing independent third-party brokerage services to banks, credit unions and other financial institutions. The purchase price was $89.5 million at closing, comprised of $78.0 million in cash financed primarily through borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, as well as the issuance of 603,660 shares of our common stock at an estimated fair value of $18.90 per share on the date of acquisition. Immediately following the acquisition, we satisfied certain obligations under a phantom stock plan for UVEST employees by issuing 65,820 shares of common stock at an estimated fair value of $18.90 per share. On June 20, 2007, we acquired the Affiliated Entities which increased the number of our advisors and strengthened our position as a leading independent broker-dealer. Accordingly, our 2007 results of operations include the activities of the Affiliated Entities beginning on June 21, 2007. Total purchase consideration was $120.5 million comprised of $63.3 million in cash funded primarily through borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, and the issuance of 2,645,500 shares of common stock with an estimated fair value of $21.60 per share on the date of acquisition. 43 Table of Contents On November 7, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of IFMG, further expanding our reach in offering financial services to banks, savings and loan institutions and credit unions nationwide. Accordingly, our 2007 results of operations include the activities of IFMG beginning on November 7, 2007. Purchase consideration at closing was $25.7 million and was financed with borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities. At the time of acquisition, we announced a plan (the Shutdown Plan) to transfer existing IFMG financial institutional relationships to our other broker-dealer subsidiaries, LPL Financial and UVEST. In accordance with the Shutdown Plan, we made several post-closing payments based on the successful recruitment, retention and transition of these relationships during the third and fourth quarter of 2008. On December 31, 2007, we ceased the operations of our subsidiary Innovex Mortgage, Inc. (Innovex). Prior to that date, Innovex provided comprehensive mortgage services for residential properties of the clients of our advisors. On September 1, 2009, we consolidated the operations of the Affiliated Entities with those of LPL Financial. The consolidation involved the transfer of securities licenses of certain registered representatives associated with the Affiliated Entities and their client accounts. Following the consolidation, the registered representatives and client accounts that were transferred are now associated with LPL Financial. The consolidation of the Affiliated Entities was effected to enhance service offerings to our advisors while also generating efficiencies. While our acquisitions of the Affiliated Entities and IFMG have contributed to the overall growth of our base of advisors and related revenue and market position, we have incurred significant non-recurring costs related to acquisition integration and the subsequent shutdown and/or conversion. Many of these expenditures are in the form of restructuring charges, personnel costs, system costs and professional fees. For example, the consolidation of the Affiliated Entities with LPL Financial in September 2009 resulted in restructuring charges including severance and one-time termination benefits, lease and contract termination fees, asset impairments and transfer and conversion costs. 44 Table of Contents Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 The following discussion presents an analysis of our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends, and where possible and practical, have quantified the impact of such items. Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 2009 % Change (In thousands) Revenues Commissions $ 388,972 $ 347,220 12.0 % Advisory fees 206,330 163,905 25.9 % Asset-based fees 71,450 62,654 14.0 % Transaction and other fees 67,363 61,338 9.8 % Other 9,291 7,861 18.2 % Net revenues 743,406 642,978 15.6 % Expenses Production 513,202 442,531 16.0 % Compensation and benefits 73,575 66,978 9.8 % General and administrative 53,237 49,871 6.7 % Depreciation and amortization 25,590 27,395 (6.6 )% Restructuring charges 3,949 (327 ) * Other 4,777 3,720 28.4 % Total operating expenses 674,330 590,168 14.3 % Non-operating interest expense 24,336 25,941 (6.2 )% Loss on equity method investment 24 84 (71.4 )% Total expenses 698,690 616,193 13.4 % Income before provision for income taxes 44,716 26,785 66.9 % Provision for income taxes 19,162 11,988 59.8 % Net income $ 25,554 $ 14,797 72.7 % * Not meaningful. 45 Table of Contents Revenues Commissions The following table sets forth our commission revenue by product category included in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 % Total 2009 % Total Variable annuities $ 155,692 40.0 % $ 129,443 37.3 % Mutual funds 115,001 29.6 % 82,822 23.9 % Fixed annuities 33,888 8.7 % 60,153 17.3 % Equities 24,106 6.2 % 20,086 5.8 % Fixed income 21,012 5.4 % 15,637 4.5 % Alternative investments 20,018 5.1 % 17,321 5.0 % Insurance 18,678 4.8 % 21,101 6.0 % Other 577 0.2 % 657 0.2 % Total commission revenue $ 388,972 100.0 % $ 347,220 100.0 % Commission revenue increased by $41.8 million, or 12.0%, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with 2009. In comparison to the prior year, trail-based commissions increased significantly as a result of improved market conditions as well as growth in assets eligible for trail payment. Transaction-based commissions increased slightly, also as a result of greater sales of commission-based products. In particular, more market sensitive products such as mutual funds and variable annuities experienced an increase over the prior year period, which was partially offset by decreased sales of financial products with more predictable cash flows such as fixed annuities and insurance products. Advisory Fees Advisory fees increased by $42.4 million, or 25.9%, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with 2009. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the rebounding market, which prompted a significant increase on the value of client assets in advisory programs. Our advisory assets increased 40.9% from $57.5 billion at March 31, 2009 to $81.0 billion at March 31, 2010. Asset-Based Fees Asset-based fees increased by $8.8 million, or 14.0%, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with 2009. This increase was primarily due to higher sponsor and record-keeping related revenues, which were driven by improved market conditions and the conversion of our Affiliated Entities to the LPL Financial self-clearing platform. This trend was partially offset by a decrease in assets held in our cash sweep programs and the depressed interest rate environment as reflected by the average effective federal funds rate and its influence on fees associated with our cash sweep programs. For the three months ended March 31, 2010, the effective federal funds rate averaged 0.13% compared to 0.19% for the three months ended March 31, 2009. Assets in our cash sweep programs averaged $18.4 billion and $22.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Transaction and Other Fees Transaction and other fees increased by $6.0 million, or 9.8%, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with 2009. This increase was primarily attributed to fees associated with advisors and their client accounts that have transitioned to our self-clearing platform. We also had an increase of $2.5 million in conference related revenues for conferences that occurred in 2010 but were 46 Table of Contents not held in the prior year. In addition, there was an increase of $3.0 million in charges to advisors largely for professional liability insurance premiums. Other Revenue Other revenue increased by $1.4 million, or 18.2%, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with 2009. The increase was due primarily to improved market conditions, which drove higher direct investment marketing allowances received from product sponsor programs. Expenses Production Expenses Production expenses increased by $70.7 million, or 16.0%, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with 2009. This increase was correlated with our commission and advisory revenues, which increased by 16.5% during the same period. Our production payout averaged 84.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 85.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2009. Compensation and Benefits Expense Compensation and benefits increased by $6.6 million, or 9.8%, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with 2009. The increase was primarily attributed to the restoration of certain employee benefits in the current year period that were suspended in 2009 as a result of our cost management initiatives. Our average number of full-time employees was 2,464 and 2,463 for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased by $3.4 million, or 6.7%, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with 2009. The increase compared to the prior year was due to aggressive cost reduction measures that took place in the first quarter of 2009 due to our ongoing strategic business review. As market conditions improve, we have cautiously reinstated certain levels of general and administrative expenses that are necessary to support the growth and service to our advisors. During the first quarter of 2010 we reinstated certain conference services, which contributed to increases of $1.7 million in promotional fees and $1.4 million in professional fees. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $1.8 million, or 6.6%, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with 2009. The decrease was attributed to lower asset balances resulting from asset impairments that were recorded in the third and fourth quarter of 2009 in the consolidation of our Affiliated Entities. Restructuring Charges Restructuring charges represent expenses incurred as a result of our 2008 strategic business review and our 2009 consolidation of the Affiliated Entities. Restructuring charges were $3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, which includes charges incurred for severance and termination benefits of $1.8 million, contract termination costs of $0.4 million, asset impairment charges of $0.2 million and $1.5 million in other expenditures principally relating to the conversion and transfer of advisors and their client accounts from the Affiliated Entities to LPL Financial. In the first quarter of 2009, we recorded $0.3 million in adjustments that reduced previously estimated restructuring charges related to our 2008 strategic business review. 47 Table of Contents Other Expenses Other expenses increased by $1.1 million, or 28.4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense. Interest Expense Interest expense includes non-operating interest expense for our senior secured credit facilities and our senior unsecured subordinated notes. Interest expense decreased by $1.6 million, or 6.2%, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with 2009. The decline reflects a decrease in the average principal amount of debt outstanding due primarily to lower level of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our average outstanding borrowing activity in the revolving and uncommitted line of credit facilities have decreased by $81.8 million from $90.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009 to $8.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010. Loss on Equity Method Investment Loss on equity method investment represents our share of losses related to our investment in a privately held technology company. Loss on equity method investment decreased by $0.1 million, or 71.4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with 2009. Provision for Income Taxes We estimate our full-year effective income tax rate at the end of each interim reporting period. This estimate is used in providing for income taxes on a year-to-date basis and may change in subsequent interim periods. The tax rate in any quarter can be affected positively and negatively by adjustments that are required to be reported in the specific quarter of resolution. During the three months ended March 31, 2010, we recorded income tax expense of $19.2 million compared with an income tax expense of $12.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009. Our effective income tax rate was 42.9% and 44.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective rates reflect the impact of state taxes, settlement contingencies and expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes. 48 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 The following discussion presents an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Revenues Commissions The following table sets forth our commission revenue, by product category included in our consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2009 % Total 2008 % Total 2007 % Total Variable annuities $ 551,345 37.3 % $ 627,021 38.2 % $ 605,318 41.2 % Mutual funds 389,458 26.4 % 474,948 28.9 % 498,880 33.9 % Fixed annuities 225,342 15.3 % 179,743 11.0 % 42,775 2.9 % Equities 86,606 5.8 % 85,586 5.2 % 82,215 5.6 % Alternative investments 77,079 5.2 % 112,706 6.9 % 113,183 7.7 % Fixed income 75,210 5.1 % 65,309 4.0 % 48,552 3.3 % Insurance 69,907 4.7 % 91,327 5.6 % 77,613 5.3 % Other 2,708 0.2 % 3,578 0.2 % 1,749 0.1 % Total commission revenue $ 1,477,655 100.0 % $ 1,640,218 100.0 % $ 1,470,285 100.0 % 49 Table of Contents Commission revenue decreased by $162.6 million, or 9.9%, for 2009 compared to 2008. Transaction-based commissions decreased as a result of market turbulence and volatility that dampened client demand for purchases of new financial products, particularly in the more market sensitive products such as mutual funds, alternative investments and variable annuities. This decline was partially offset by increased sales of products with more predictable cash flows such as fixed annuities and fixed income securities. Trail commissions reflect the effects of the market declines offset by growth in assets eligible for trail payment. Commission revenue increased by $169.9 million, or 11.6%, for 2008 compared to 2007, fueled primarily by the commission base obtained through our acquisitions of the Affiliated Entities and IFMG. Organic commission revenue growth remained relatively flat during this same period, attributed to the successful recruitment of our base of advisors which increased 7.5% to 11,920 in 2008 from 11,089 in 2007, largely offset by a decline in commissionable transactions and brokerage assets under management due to the unfavorable market conditions in 2008. Advisory Fees Advisory fees decreased by $126.4 million, or 15.2%, for 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the effect of the declining value of client assets in advisory programs, offset by increasing sales attributed to new advisory relationships. Advisory fees increased by $91.6 million, or 12.4%, in 2008 from 2007, driven in part by the advisory fee base obtained through our acquisitions of the Affiliated Entities and IFMG, in addition to a trend amongst our advisors to provide a higher percentage of fee-based advisory services to their clients, which are recurring revenue streams. Consequently our recurring revenues as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively unchanged through the unfavorable market conditions in 2008. Asset-Based Fees Asset-based fees decreased by $79.4 million, or 22.5%, for 2009 compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by the declining interest rate environment as reflected by the average effective federal funds rate and its influence on fees associated with our cash sweep programs. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the effective federal funds rate averaged 0.16% compared to 1.92% for the prior year. Assets in our cash sweep programs averaged $20.5 billion and $19.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Asset-based fees increased by $91.4 million, or 35.0%, from 2007 to 2008. Fees from our cash sweep vehicles increased $60.9 million driven primarily by a 72.7% increase in the average assets custodied in these programs, which can be attributed to prevailing negative market conditions and the resulting shift of client assets from invested capital to our cash sweep programs. For 2008, the increase associated with this trend was partially offset by the negative interest rate environment and its influence on the margins associated with these products. Transaction and Other Fees Transaction and other fees increased $15.1 million, or 6.3%, for 2009 compared to 2008. This increase was primarily attributed to increases in our number of advisors and their client accounts. We also had increases of $6.6 million in charges to advisors largely for professional liability insurance premiums and $5.3 million in IRA custodial fees, offset by a $4.4 million decline in conference related revenues. Transaction and other fees increased $55.9 million, or 30.3%, in 2008 from 2007. The increase was attributed primarily to a 4.8 million, or 59.3%, increase in trade volume in 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of underlying client accounts through our acquisitions of the Affiliated Entities and IFMG. 50 Table of Contents Other Revenue Prior to our dissolution of our mortgage subsidiary, Innovex, other revenue also consisted of gains on the sale of mortgage loans held for sale. Other revenue decreased $13.6 million, or 25.7%, for 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was due primarily to lower interest revenue from client margin lending activities and to a lesser extent by lower interest income earned on our cash equivalents. Our average client margin balances decreased 33.5% from $328.3 million in 2008 to $218.3 million in 2009, reflecting a reduced demand by clients for margin leverage. Other revenue decreased $9.0 million, or 14.6%, in 2008 from 2007. Through our mortgage affiliate Innovex, we recognized gains related to mortgage loans held for sale during 2007 that did not recur in 2008 because we ceased the operations of Innovex on December 31, 2007. Expenses Production Expenses Production expenses decreased by $258.5 million, or 11.9%, for 2009 compared to 2008. Commission and advisory revenues declined $289.0 million, or 11.7%, during the same period, resulting in a corresponding decrease in our production payout to our advisors. Our production payout averaged 85.8% in 2009 and 86.3% in 2008. Production expenses increased by $227.6 million, or 11.8%, for 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in production expenses was highly correlated with our increase in commission and advisory revenues, which increased by $261.6 million, or 11.8%, for 2008 compared to 2007. Our production payout averaged 86.3% in 2008 and 86.4% in 2007. Compensation and Benefits Expense Compensation and benefits expense decreased by $72.7 million, or 21.2%, for 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily attributed to our ongoing strategic business review and resulting cost management initiatives. As a result of attrition, retirements and our reduction in workforce implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008, our average number of full-time employees declined by 383, or 13.6%, to 2,430 for 2009, compared to 2,813 for 2008. Compensation and benefits increased by $86.0 million, or 33.4%, for 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was attributed to salaries and benefits and the average number of full-time employees, which grew by 729, or 35.0%, to 2,813 in 2008, compared to 2,084 in 2007, primarily due to our acquisitions of the Affiliated Entities and IFMG and resulting integration efforts, and our initiative to strengthen our service infrastructure. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased by $48.0 million, or 18.0%, for 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily attributable to our ongoing strategic business review and resulting cost reduction measures which led to decreases of $38.3 million in promotional fees, $8.3 million in occupancy and equipment, $5.8 million in travel and entertainment and $3.8 million in communications and data processing. General and administrative expenses increased by $66.6 million, or 33.3%, for 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of $35.4 million in promotional fees and recruiting, $15.3 million in occupancy and equipment and $12.1 million in communication and data processing. The increase in these expenses was primarily due to our acquisitions of the Affiliated Entities and IFMG, and resulting integration efforts to support our overall growth. 51 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $7.8 million, or 7.8%, for 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was attributed to capital expenditures made to support integration efforts and the general growth of our business. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $21.7 million, or 27.6%, for 2008 compared to 2007, attributed to amortization of identifiable intangible assets and depreciation and amortization of fixed assets resulting from our acquisitions of the Affiliated Entities and IFMG, as well as capital expenditures made to support integration efforts and the general growth of our business. Restructuring Charges Restructuring charges were $58.7 million in 2009, compared to $15.0 million in 2008. In 2009, restructuring charges were incurred for severance and termination benefits of $9.5 million, contract termination costs of $15.9 million, asset impairment charges of $19.9 million and $13.9 million in other expenditures principally relating to the conversion and transfer of advisors and their client accounts from the Affiliated Entities to LPL Financial. These costs were partially offset by $0.5 million in adjustments that were recorded in the first half of 2009 for changes in cost estimates associated with post-employment benefits provided to employees impacted by our 2008 strategic business review. In 2008, we committed to and implemented a strategic business review, resulting in a reduction in our overall workforce of approximately 250 employees, or approximately 10% of our workforce. Accordingly, we recorded a $15.0 million restructuring charge at the time such plan was communicated to our employees. Other Expenses Other expenses decreased by $2.3 million, or 12.9%, from 2008 to 2009. The decrease was primarily due to cost reduction measures. Other expenses increased by $3.6 million, or 26.0%, from 2007 to 2008. The increase was due primarily to increases in bad debt expense and write-off activity with respect to our advisors. The remaining increase was due to storage services, which grew by $1.1 million in 2008. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased by $14.6 million, or 12.7%, for 2009 compared with 2008. The decline reflected lower average interest rates on our borrowings due in part to a credit rating upgrade received in the third quarter of 2008, partially offset by an increase in the average principal amount of debt outstanding due primarily to borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our average outstanding borrowing activity in the revolving and uncommitted line of credit facilities increased by $7.8 million from $48.7 million for 2008 to $56.5 million for 2009. Interest expense decreased by $7.3 million, or 5.9%, from 2007 to 2008, reflecting lower average interest rates on our borrowings due in part by a credit rating upgrade, partially offset by an increase in the principal amount of debt outstanding. Loss on Equity Method Investment Loss on equity investment decreased by $2.1 million, or 87.4%, for 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was attributed to a $1.7 million other than temporary impairment charge incurred during the second quarter of 2008. Loss on equity method investment increased by $1.7 million, or 250.1%, for 2008 compared to 2007, due to the $1.7 million other than temporary impairment charge during the second quarter of 2008. 52 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes decreased by $22.2 million, or 47.0%, between 2008 and 2009. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in the effective income tax rate under GAAP, which was 34.5% for 2009 as compared to 51.0% for 2008, as well as a decline in pre-tax income. In addition, our current effective tax rate reflects a benefit of approximately 8% from a newly enacted change to Californias income sourcing rules that are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2011. This change requires us to revalue our deferred tax liabilities to the rate that will be in effect when the tax liabilities are utilized. Our provision for income taxes increased by $0.5 million, or 1.1%, between 2007 and 2008. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in the effective income tax rate under GAAP, which was 51.0% for 2008 as compared to 43.4% for 2007, offset largely by a decline in pre-tax income. Changes in our effective tax rates reflect additional expenses and/or changes in our estimates for expenses that cannot be deducted for income tax purposes, namely a change in our estimates for certain state income tax rates and the impact of that change on our deferred tax liabilities. Additional increases in our effective tax rates relate to increases in items such as meals and entertainment and compensation for incentive stock options.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Senior management establishes our liquidity and capital policies. These policies include senior managements review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures and daily monitoring of liquidity for our subsidiaries. Decisions on the allocation of capital include projected profitability and cash flow, risks of the business, regulatory capital requirements and future liquidity needs for strategic activities. Our Treasury Department assists in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the business activities that impact our financial condition, liquidity and capital structure and maintains relationships with various lenders. The objectives of these policies are to support the executive business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity. 54 Table of Contents A summary of changes in cash flow data is provided as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2009 2008 2007 Net cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities $ (86,022 ) $ 103,885 $ 271,157 $ 89,277 $ 10,072 Investing activities (3,775 ) (1,905 ) (13,724 ) (76,202 ) (168,275 ) Financing activities 35,964 (1,825 ) (98,078 ) 18,161 101,043 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (53,833 ) 100,155 159,355 31,236 (57,160 ) Cash and cash equivalents  beginning of period 378,594 219,239 219,239 188,003 245,163 Cash and cash equivalents  end of period $ 324,761 $ 319,394 $ 378,594 $ 219,239 $ 188,003 Cash requirements and liquidity needs are primarily funded through our cash flow from operations and our capacity for additional borrowing. Net cash used in or provided by operating activities includes net income adjusted for non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, share based compensation, deferred income tax provision and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Operating assets and liabilities include balances related to settlement and funding of client transactions, receivables from product sponsors and accrued commissions and advisory fees due to our advisors. Operating assets and liabilities that arise from the settlement and funding of transactions by our advisors clients are the principal cause of changes to our net cash from operating activities and can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on overall trends and client behaviors. Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2010 was $86.0 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $103.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled $271.2 million, $89.3 million and $10.1 million, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2009 totaled $3.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2010 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2009 was principally due to a $2.5 million deposit to the escrow account in the first quarter of 2010 (See Note 3 of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). Net cash used in investing activities for 2009, 2008 and 2007, totaled $13.7 million, $76.2 million and $168.3 million, respectively. The decrease in 2009 as compared to 2008 was principally due to a decrease in capital expenditures and acquisition activity. The decrease in 2008 as compared to 2007 was principally due to our 2007 acquisitions of UVEST, the Affiliated Entities and IFMG. Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2010 was $36.0 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009. The increase in cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2010 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2009 was primarily related to proceeds of $40.0 million from our uncommitted lines of credit in the first quarter of 2010. Net cash used in financing activities for 2009 was $98.1 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities for 2008 and 2007 of $18.2 million and $101.0 million, respectively. The decrease in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily related to a $90.0 million pay down on our revolving line of credit, which occurred in 2009. The decrease in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily related to borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, which did not recur at the 55 Table of Contents same level in 2008. These borrowings in 2007 were principally related to our acquisitions of UVEST, the Affiliated Entities and IFMG. We believe that based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flow from operations, together with other available sources of funds, will be adequate to satisfy our working capital needs, the payment of all of our obligations and the funding of anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. Operating Capital Requirements Our primary requirement for working capital relates to funds we loan to our advisors clients for trading done on margin and funds we are required to maintain at clearing organizations to support these clients trading activities. We require that our advisors clients deposit funds with us in support of their trading activities and we hypothecate securities held as margin collateral, which we in turn use to lend to clients for margin transactions and deposit with our clearing organizations. These activities account for the majority of our working capital requirements, which are primarily funded directly or indirectly by our advisors clients. Our other working capital needs are primarily limited to regulatory capital requirements and software development, which we have satisfied in the past from internally generated cash flows. Notwithstanding the self-funding nature of our operations, we may sometimes be required to fund timing differences arising from the delayed receipt of client funds associated with the settlement of client transactions in securities markets. Historically, these timing differences were funded either with internally generated cash flow or, if needed, with funds drawn under short-term borrowing facilities, including both committed unsecured lines of credit and uncommitted lines of credit secured by client securities. LPL Financial, one of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, utilizes uncommitted lines secured by client securities to fund margin loans and other client transaction-related timing differences. Our registered broker-dealers are subject to the SECs Uniform Net Capital Rule, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. LPL Financial and Associated compute net capital requirements under the alternative method, which requires firms to maintain minimum net capital, as defined, equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions plus 1% of net commission payable, as defined. LPL Financial is also subject to the CFTCs minimum financial requirements, which require that it maintain net capital, as defined, equal to 4% of customer funds required to be segregated pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act, less the market value of certain commodity options, all as defined. UVEST, MSC and WFG all compute net capital requirements under the aggregate indebtedness method, which requires firms to maintain minimum net capital, as defined, of not less than 6.67% of aggregate indebtedness plus 1% of net commission payable, also as defined. Our subsidiary, The Private Trust Company, N.A. (PTC), is subject to various regulatory capital requirements. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity Assessment Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, our operating results, cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. Some risks that could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions and economic activity in the financial markets. The performance of our business is correlated with the economy and 56 Table of Contents financial markets, and a continuing slowdown in the economy or financial markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity constraints and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. However, our senior secured credit agreement will restrict our ability to dispose of assets and the use of proceeds from any such dispositions. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and even if we could consummate such dispositions, or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and, in any event, the proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Indebtedness On May 24, 2010, we amended and restated our senior secured credit agreement to add a new term loan tranche of $580.0 million maturing at June 28, 2017, which we used, together with cash on hand, to repay our $550.0 million of senior unsecured subordinated notes, as described below. We also extended the maturity of a $500.0 million tranche of our term loan facility to June 25, 2015, with the remaining $317.1 million tranche maturing at the original maturity date of June 28, 2013. On May 24, 2010, we gave notice of redemption of all of our outstanding senior unsecured subordinated notes. As of March 31, 2010, we had outstanding $550.0 million of our senior unsecured subordinated notes. The redemption price of the senior unsecured subordinated notes is 105.375% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to but not including June 22, 2010 (the Redemption Date). The senior unsecured subordinated notes will be redeemed on the Redemption Date. We also maintain a revolving credit facility which is provided through the senior secured credit facilities. On January 25, 2010, we amended our senior secured credit agreement to increase the revolving credit facility from $100 million to $218.2 million. In connection with this amendment, we extended the maturity of a $163.5 million tranche of the revolving credit facility to June 28, 2013. The remaining $54.7 million tranche retains its original maturity date of December 28, 2011. We also maintain two uncommitted lines of credit. One of the lines has an unspecified limit, and is primarily dependent on our ability to provide sufficient collateral. The other line has a limit of $100 million (increased to $150 million on May 27, 2010) and allows for both collateralized and uncollateralized (unsecured) borrowings. We also are a party to interest rate swap agreements, in a notional amount of $400 million, to mitigate interest rate risk by hedging the variability of a portion of our floating-rate senior secured term loan. Interest Rate and Fees Borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a base rate equal to the one, two, three, six, nine or twelve-month LIBOR plus our applicable margin, or an alternative base rate (ABR) plus our applicable margin. The ABR is equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the effective federal funds rate in effect on such day plus 0.5% and (c) solely in the case of the 2015 Term Loans and the 2017 Term Loans, 2.50%. The applicable margin for borrowings (a) with respect to the 2013 Term Loans is currently 0.75% for base rate borrowings and 1.75% for LIBOR borrowings, (b) with respect to the 2015 Term Loans is currently 1.75% for base rate borrowings and 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings, (c) with respect to the 2017 Term Loans is currently 2.75% for base rate borrowings and 3.75% for LIBOR borrowings, (d) with respect to revolver tranche maturing in 2011 is currently 1.00% for base rate borrowings and 57 Table of Contents 2.00% for LIBOR borrowings and (e) with respect to revolver tranche maturing in 2013 is currently 2.50% for base rate borrowings and 3.50% for LIBOR borrowings. The applicable margin on our 2013 Term Loans could change depending on our credit rating. The LIBOR Rate with respect to the 2015 Term Loans and the 2017 Term Loans shall in no event be less than 1.50%. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the senior secured credit facilities, we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The commitment fee rates at March 31, 2010 were 0.375% for our revolver tranche maturing in 2011 and 0.75% for our revolver tranche maturing in 2013, but are subject to change depending on our leverage ratio. We must also pay customary letter of credit fees. Prepayments The senior secured credit facilities (other than the revolving credit facility) require us to prepay outstanding amounts under our senior secured term loan facility subject to certain exceptions, with:  50% (percentage will be reduced to 25% if our total leverage ratio is 5.00 or less and to 0% if our total leverage ratio is 4.00 or less) of our annual excess cash flow (as defined in our senior secured credit agreement) adjusted for, among other things, changes in our net working capital;  100% of the net cash proceeds of all nonordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property, if we do not reinvest or commit to reinvest those proceeds in assets to be used in our business or to make certain other permitted investments within 15 months as long as such reinvestment is completed within 180 days and  100% of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt, other than proceeds from debt permitted under the senior secured credit agreement. The foregoing mandatory prepayments will be applied to scheduled installments of principal of the senior secured term loan facility in direct order. We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the senior secured credit agreement at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to LIBOR loans. Amortization We are required to repay the loans under the senior secured term loan facility in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1% of the original funded principal amount of such facility, with the balance being payable on the final maturity date of the facility. Principal amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facilities are due and payable in full at maturity. Guarantee and Security The senior secured credit facilities are secured primarily through pledges of the capital stock in our subsidiaries. Certain Covenants and Events of Default The senior secured credit agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to:  incur additional indebtedness;  create liens;  enter into sale and leaseback transactions; 58 Table of Contents  engage in mergers or consolidations;  sell or transfer assets;  pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock;  make investments, loans or advances;  prepay certain subordinated indebtedness;  engage in certain transactions with affiliates;  amend material agreements governing certain subordinated indebtedness or  change our lines of business. In addition, our financial covenant requirements include a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage ratio test. Under our leverage ratio test, we covenant not to allow the ratio of our consolidated total debt (as defined in our senior secured credit agreement) to an adjusted EBITDA reflecting financial covenants in our senior secured credit facilities (Credit Agreement Adjusted EBITDA) to exceed certain prescribed levels set forth in the agreement. Under our interest coverage ratio test, we covenant not to allow the ratio of our Credit Agreement Adjusted EBITDA to our consolidated interest expense (as defined in our senior secured credit agreement) to be less than certain prescribed levels set forth in the agreement. Each of our financial ratios is measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. As of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all of our covenant requirements. Our covenant requirements and pro forma ratios as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 are as follows: March 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Covenant Actual Covenant Actual Financial Ratio Requirement Ratio Requirement Ratio Leverage Test (Maximum) 4.40 3.08 4.60 3.42 Interest Coverage (Minimum) 2.25 3.97 2.15 3.81 Set forth below is a reconciliation from EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Agreement Adjusted EBITDA to our net income for the trailing twelve months ending March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Twelve Months Ended, March 31, December 31, 2010 2009 Net income $ 58,277 $ 47,520 Interest expense 99,317 100,922 Income tax expense 32,221 25,047 Depreciation and amortization 106,491 108,296 EBITDA 296,306 281,785 Share-based compensation expense(1) 7,748 6,437 Acquisition and integration related expenses(2) 2,355 3,037 Restructuring and conversion costs(3) 72,896 64,658 Other(4) 272 151 Adjusted EBITDA 379,577 356,068 Pro-forma adjustments(5)   Credit Agreement Adjusted EBITDA $ 379,577 $ 356,068 59 Table of Contents (1) Represents share-based compensation for stock options awarded to employees and non-executive directors.

(5) Credit Agreement Adjusted EBITDA excludes pro forma general and administrative expenditures from acquisitions, as defined under the terms our senior secured credit agreement. There were no such adjustments for the twelve month periods ended March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Interest Rate Swaps An interest rate swap is a financial derivative instrument whereby two parties enter into a contractual agreement to exchange payments based on underlying interest rates. We use interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability on our floating rate for $400.0 million of our term loan under our senior secured credit facilities. We are required to pay the counterparty to the agreement fixed interest payments on a notional balance and in turn receive variable interest payments on that notional balance. Payments are settled quarterly on a net basis. As of March 31, 2010, we assessed our interest rate swaps as being highly effective and we expect them to continue to be highly effective. While approximately $417.1 million of our term loan remains unhedged as of March 31, 2010, the risk of variability on our floating interest rate is partially mitigated by the client margin loans on which we carry floating interest rates. At March 31, 2010, our receivables from our advisors clients for margin loan activity were approximately $222.6 million. Senior Unsecured Subordinated Notes As of March 31, 2010, we had outstanding $550.0 million of our senior unsecured subordinated notes. On May 24, 2010, we gave notice of redemption of all of our outstanding senior unsecured subordinated notes. The redemption price of the senior unsecured subordinated notes is 105.375% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but not including the Redemption Date. The senior unsecured subordinated notes will be redeemed on the Redemption Date. Prior to this redemption, our senior unsecured subordinated notes were due in 2015 and bore interest at 10.75% per annum. Interest payments were payable semi-annually in arrears. Bank Loans Payable We maintain two uncommitted lines of credit. One line has an unspecified limit, and is primarily dependent on the companys ability to provide sufficient collateral. The other line has a $150.0 million limit and allows for both collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings. At March 31, 2010 there was a $40.0 million outstanding balance on the unsecured portion of one of the uncommitted lines of credit. The line was subsequently paid down in full on April 1, 2010. Both lines were utilized in 2009, however there were no balances outstanding at December 31, 2009. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We enter into various off-balance-sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our advisors clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. For information on these arrangements, see Notes 14 and 20 to our consolidated financial statements. 60 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table provides information with respect to our commitments and obligations as of March 31, 2010: Payments Due by Period < 1 1-3 4-5 > 5 Total Year Years Years Years (In thousands) Leases and other obligations(1) $ 115,005 $ 29,688 $ 49,929 $ 22,099 $ 13,289 Bank loans payable  unsecured 40,000 40,000    Senior secured credit facilities and senior unsecured subordinated notes(2)(3) 1,367,117 8,424 16,848 791,845 550,000 Fixed interest payments 337,505 59,125 118,250 118,250 41,880 Variable interest payments(2)(3) 92,617 20,174 64,268 8,175  Interest rate swap agreements(2)(3) 17,881 12,189 5,692   Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,970,125 $ 169,600 $ 254,987 $ 940,369 $ 605,169 (1) Minimum payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rental income of $0.5 million due in the future under noncancelable subleases. Note 10 of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements provides further detail on operating lease obligations and obligations under non-cancelable service contracts. (2) Notes 8 and 9 of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements provide further detail on these debt obligations. (3) Our senior secured credit facilities bear interest at floating rates. Of the $817.1 million outstanding at March 31, 2010, we have hedged the variable rate cash flows using interest rate swaps of $400.0 million of principal (see Notes 8 and 9 of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2010). Variable interest payments are shown for the unhedged ($417.1 million) portion of the senior secured credit facilities assuming the three-month LIBOR at March 31, 2010 remains unchanged (see Note 8 of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information). As of March 31, 2010, we reflect a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $22.5 million, which we have included in income taxes payable on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. This amount has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of future tax payments. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We use fair value measurements to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures. We use prices obtained from an independent third-party pricing service to measure the fair value of our trading securities. We validate prices received from the pricing service using various methods including, comparison to prices received from additional pricing services, comparison to available market prices and review of other relevant market data including implied yields of major categories of securities. At March 31, 2010, we did not adjust prices received from the independent third-party pricing service. For certificates of deposit and treasury securities, we utilize market-based inputs including observable market interest rates that correspond to the remaining maturities or next interest reset dates. 61 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that of our critical accounting policies, the following are noteworthy because they require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and reported financial results. Revenue Recognition We record commissions received from mutual funds, annuity, insurance, equity, fixed income, direct investment, option and commodity transactions on a trade-date basis. Commissions also include mutual fund and variable annuity trails, which are recognized as a percentage of assets under management over the period for which services are performed. Due to the significant volume of mutual fund and variable annuity purchases and sales transacted by financial advisors directly with product manufacturers, management must estimate a portion of its upfront commission and trail revenues for each accounting period for which the proceeds have not yet been received. These estimates are based on a number of factors including market levels, the volume of transactions in prior periods and cash receipts in the current period. We record commissions payable based upon standard payout ratios for each product as it accrues for commission revenue. Legal Reserves We record reserves for legal proceedings in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial condition. The determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management. We consider many factors including, but not limited to, the amount of the claim, the amount of the loss in the clients account, the basis and validity of the claim, the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of a advisor, likely insurance coverage, previous results in similar cases and legal precedents and case law. Each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management. Any change in the reserve amount is recorded as professional services in our consolidated statements of income. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangibles Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for the excess. We have elected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on October 1, 2009, we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units (generally defined as businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its carrying value, and therefore we concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired. The estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit. Adverse changes in our planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of our recorded goodwill. We review our property, equipment, capitalized software and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events or changes may include a deterioration in the business climate or a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used. If the 62 Table of Contents total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset, we may need to record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Income Taxes We estimate income tax expense based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. We must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is established to the extent that it is more-likely-than-not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized. When we establish a valuation allowance or modify the existing allowance in a certain reporting period, we generally record a corresponding increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income. We make significant judgments in determining the provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against the deferred tax asset. Changes in the estimate of these taxes occur periodically due to changes in the tax rates, changes in the business operations, implementation of tax planning strategies, resolution with taxing authorities of issues where we have previously taken certain tax positions and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. Additionally, we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP. The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous. We are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. As such, changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements. Valuation and Accounting for Financial Derivatives We periodically use financial derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, to protect us against changing market prices or interest rates and the related impact to our assets, liabilities, or cash flows. We also evaluate our contracts and commitments for terms that qualify as embedded derivatives. All derivatives are reported at their corresponding fair value in our consolidated statements of financial condition. Financial derivative instruments expected to be highly effective hedges against changes in cash flows are designated as such upon entering into the agreement. At each reporting date, we reassess the effectiveness of the hedge to determine whether or not it can continue to use hedge accounting. Under hedge accounting, we record the increase or decrease in fair value of the derivative, net of tax impact, as other comprehensive income or losses. If the hedge is not determined to be a perfect hedge, yet still considered highly effective, we will calculate the ineffective portion and record the related change in its fair value as additional interest income or expense in the consolidated statements of income. Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income are generally reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Share-Based Compensation Certain employees, advisors, officers and directors who contribute to our success participate in various stock option plans. In addition, certain financial institutions participate in a warrant plan. Stock options and warrants generally vest in equal increments over a three to five-year period and expire on the 10th anniversary following the date of grant. We recognize share-based compensation expense related to employee stock option awards in net income based on the grant-date fair value over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which generally equals the vesting period. We account for stock options and warrants awarded 63 Table of Contents to our advisors and financial institutions based on the fair value of the award at each interim reporting period. We record the increase in price of the option or warrant as commission expense during such period. If the value of our common stock increases over a given period, this accounting treatment results in additional commission expense. As there are no observable market prices for identical or similar instruments, we estimate fair value using a Black Scholes valuation model. We must make assumptions regarding the number of share-based awards that will be forfeited. The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate. Therefore, changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period. Rather, different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period. The following table presents the weighted average assumptions used by us in calculating the fair value of our stock options and warrants with the Black Scholes valuation model for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 and the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: March 31, December 31, 2010 2009 2009 2008 2007 Expected life (in years) 6.51 8.81 7.13 6.52 6.50 Expected stock price volatility 50.32 % 48.67 % 51.35 % 33.78 % 31.08 % Expected dividend yield      Annualized forfeiture rate 4.99 % 3.00 % 4.35 % 1.51 % 1.00 % Fair value of options $ 12.34 $ 10.40 $ 12.30 $ 9.96 $ 9.86 Risk-free interest rate 2.79 % 2.45 % 2.93 % 2.73 % 4.93 % The risk-free interest rates are based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of the grant with remaining terms equivalent to the respective expected terms of the options. The dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have no present intention to pay cash dividends. In the future, as we gain historical data for volatility of our stock and the actual term over which employees hold our options, expected volatility and the expected term may change, which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, compensation recorded on future grants. We estimate the expected term for our employee option awards using the simplified method in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 110, Certain Assumptions Used in Valuation Methods , because we do not have sufficient relevant historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns. We estimate the expected term for stock options and warrants awarded to our advisors using the contractual term. Expected volatility is calculated based on companies of similar growth and maturity and our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data. We will continue to use peer group volatility information until our historical volatility is relevant to measure expected volatility for future grants. We have assumed an annualized forfeiture rate for our stock options and warrants based on a combined review of industry and employee turnover data, as well as an analytical review performed of historical pre-vesting forfeitures occurring over the previous year. We record additional expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated and record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeiture is higher than estimated. As of each stock option grant date, we considered the fair value of the underlying common stock, determined as described below, in order to establish the option exercise price. As of each stock option grant date, we reviewed an average of the disclosed year-end volatility of a group of companies that we considered peers based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, similarity to us with respect to industry, business model, stage of growth, financial risk or other factors, along with considering the future plans of our company to determine the appropriate volatility. The expected life was based on our historical stock option activity. The risk-free interest rate was determined by reference to the United States Treasury rates with the remaining term approximating the expected life 64 Table of Contents assumed at the date of grant. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those options expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience. Further, to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.

We considered numerous objective and subjective factors in valuing our common stock, on quarterly valuation dates, in accordance with the guidance in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (the Practice Aid). These objective and subjective factors included, but were not limited to:  current and projected market multiples of revenues and earnings, including for peer companies;  multiples implied from recently-completed transactions involving financial services companies;  our projected growth rates in revenues and earnings, including EBITDA, as compared to peer companies;  contemporaneous independent valuations performed on a quarterly basis and  our weighted average cost of capital. Since 2008, independent valuations have been performed on a quarterly basis, and are considered in the course of determining the fair market value of our common stock. Our independent valuations were performed in accordance with the Practice Aid and derive an indicated value using a weighted average of three methods. The primary method employs a market approach using multiples of historical and projected EBITDA and pre-tax income for peer companies. We also consider a market approach using prices of recent transactions involving financial services companies and an income approach based upon discounted cash flow projections. Prior to the March 31, 2010 valuation, the indicated value was decreased by a market discount factor, reflecting our private status. This marketability discount factor ranged from 10 to 20% of the indicated value. The valuation report is then reviewed, and the fair value per share of common stock is determined, as of each quarter end period. That value is applied to any share or share-based issuance made during the following quarter. Prior to 2008, we relied on internally developed valuation models that used methods similar to those used in our independent valuations. In addition to use in determining the value of stock-based 66 Table of Contents compensation, these valuations were used in connection with several acquisitions for which a portion of the consideration paid was company stock. We have issued 7,423,973 restricted shares to our advisors. These restricted shares may not be sold, assigned or transferred and are not entitled to receive dividends or non-cash distributions, until either a sale of the company that constitutes a change in control or an initial public offering. We account for these restricted shares by measuring such grants at their then-current lowest aggregate value. Since the value is contingent upon the companys decision to sell itself or issue its common stock through an initial public offering, the current aggregate value will be zero until such event occurs. Upon the closing of this offering, we will record the par value, additional paid-in capital and expense based on the fair value per share multiplied by 7,423,973 restricted shares. We will also record an income tax benefit equal to our effective incremental income tax rate in effect for the period in which the offering occurs. Based on an assumed initial public offering price of , which is the midpoint of the range listed in the cover page of this prospectus, we expect the pre-tax expense to be $ million and the related tax benefit to be $ million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk We bear some market risk on margin transactions affected for our advisors clients. In margin transactions we extend credit to clients collateralized by cash and securities in the clients account. As our advisors execute margin transactions on behalf of their clients, we may incur losses if clients do not fulfill their obligations, the collateral in the clients account is insufficient to fully cover losses from such investments, and our advisors fail to reimburse us for such losses. The risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the client. To minimize this risk we assess the creditworthiness of the clients and monitor the margin level daily. Clients are required to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary. We also have market risk on the fees we earn that are based on the market value of advisory and brokerage assets, assets on which trail commissions are paid and assets eligible for sponsor payments. We do not enter into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to risk associated with changes in interest rates. As of March 31, 2010, all of the outstanding debt under our senior secured credit facilities, $817.1 million, was subject to floating interest rate risk. To provide some protection against potential rate increases associated with our floating senior secured credit facilities, we have entered into derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swap agreements covering a significant portion ($400.0 million) of our senior secured indebtedness. The interest rate swap agreements qualify for hedge accounting and have been designated as cash flow hedges against specific payments due on our senior secured term loan. Accordingly, any interest rate differential is reflected in an adjustment to interest expense over the lives of the interest rate swap agreements. While the unhedged portion of our senior secured debt is subject to increases in interest rates, we believe that this risk is offset with variable interest rates associated with client borrowings. At March 31, 2010, we had $417.1 million in unhedged senior secured borrowings, the variable cost of which is partially offset by variable interest income on $222.6 million of client margin receivables. Because of this relationship, and our expectation for outstanding balances in the future, we do not believe that a short-term change in interest rates would 67 Table of Contents have a material impact on our income before taxes. For a discussion of such interest rate swap agreements, see Note 9 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. We offer our advisors and their clients two primary cash sweep programs that are interest rate sensitive: our bank sweep programs and money market sweep vehicles involving multiple money market fund providers. Our bank sweep programs use multiple non-affiliated banks to provide up to $1.5 million ($3.0 million joint) of FDIC insurance for client deposits custodied at the banks. While clients earn interest for balances on deposit in the bank sweep programs, we earn a fee. Our fees from the bank sweep programs are based on prevailing interest rates in the current interest rate environment, but may be adjusted in an increasing or decreasing interest rate environment or for other reasons. Changes in interest rates and fees for the bank sweep programs are monitored by our Fee and Rate Setting Committee (the FRS Committee), which governs and approves any changes to our fees. By meeting promptly after interest rates change, or for other market or non-market reasons, the FRS Committee balances financial risk of the bank sweep programs with products that offer competitive client yields. However, as short-term interest rates hit lower levels, the FRS Committee may be compelled to lower fees. The average Federal Reserve effective federal funds rate for March 2010 was 0.16%. A change in short-term interest rates of 10 basis points, if accompanied by a commensurate change in fees for our cash sweep programs, could result in an increase or decrease in income before income taxes of $11.4 million on an annual basis (assuming that client balances at March 31, 2010 did not change). Actual impacts may vary depending on interest rate levels, the significance of change, and the FRS Committees strategy in responding to that change. Operational Risk Operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes. We operate in diverse markets and are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. These risks are less direct than credit and market risk, but managing them is critical, particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees or advisors, we could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions and damage to our reputation. Business continuity plans exist for critical systems, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. In order to mitigate and control operational risk, we have developed and continue to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout our organization and within various departments. These control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that our employees, advisors operate within established corporate policies and limits. 68 Table of Contents BUSINESS Overview We provide an integrated platform of proprietary technology, brokerage and investment advisory services to over 12,000 independent financial advisors and financial advisors at financial institutions across the country, enabling them to successfully service their retail investors with unbiased, conflict-free financial advice.

In addition, according to Cerulli Associates, $8.5 trillion of retail assets were professionally managed as of December 31, 2008, up from $6.8 trillion as of December 31, 2003. Finally, 58% of all U.S. households utilized a financial advisor in 2008. Cerulli Associates divides the retail advisor market into six broad channels: the two independent channels that we serve (independent and RIAs) and four employee model or captive channels (insurance, wirehouse, regional and bank). # of Assets Payout Channel # of Firms Advisors ($ billions) Range Example Firms Independent 1,203 (1) 113,746 (1) $ 1,801 (1) 70-100% LPL, Raymond James, Cetera RIA(2) 14,502 18,582 $ 911 100% n/a Wirehouse 4 54,865 $ 3,947 30-50% Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch, UBS, Wells Fargo Insurance 79 70,405 $ 283 40-60% NYLIFE Securities, Mass Mutual Investor Srvcs, Signator (John Hancock) Regional 199 35,960 $ 1,149 40-60% Edward Jones, RBC Dain Rauscher, Robert W. Baird, Morgan Keegan Bank 282 16,406 $ 182 30-50% Citizens Bank, Fifth Third Bank, Third-party marketers (PrimeVest) Source: Cerulli Associates Intermediary Matrix, 2009 69 Table of Contents (1) The number of advisors in the Independent channel includes 14,769 dually-registered advisors managing $619 billion in assets. Dually-registered advisors are not included in firm count. (2) RIA firms are registered with the SEC but custody their assets with companies such as LPL, Charles Schwab and Fidelity. During the period from 2004 to 2008, the independent channels experienced substantial growth on both an absolute and relative basis, taking market share from the captive channels. According to Cerulli Associates, the independent channels market share by number of advisors increased from 40% in 2004 to 43% in 2008. In 2008, over 132,000 independent financial advisors managed $2.7 trillion in client assets, representing 33% of total retail advisor client assets. Cerulli Associates forecasts that total U.S. assets under management will grow 29% from 2008 to 2012 due to factors such as the retirement of the baby boomer generation as well as the continued growth of individual retirement account rollovers. During the same period, Cerulli Associates estimates that the independent channels market share by number of advisors will grow by seven percentage points to 50%, and market share by client assets will grow six percentage points to 39%. There are several key factors driving the growth of the independent channels:  Demand for Independent Investment Advice. We believe investors, particularly those in the mass affluent market, and increasingly in the high net worth market, are seeking unbiased, conflict-free advice; a need that has become more acute given recent market volatility, the ever increasing complexity of the securities markets and the baby boomer generations focus on retirement savings. Independent financial advisors are uniquely equipped to provide this investment advice because, unlike their captive competitors, they are not committed to any particular proprietary products or production targets and can therefore concentrate solely on what is in the best interest of their clients.  Ongoing Challenges Among the Captive Platforms. We believe the number of financial advisors electing to leave the large captive financial institutions to become independent financial advisors has accelerated over the last several years because of the ongoing consolidation among the captive platforms, particularly among the wirehouses, and because of the reputational harm suffered by several of the largest financial institutions during the recent financial crisis. Furthermore, we believe many of our captive competitors are unwilling to focus on the mass affluent market because, unlike LPL, they are unable to service this market profitably.  Greater Autonomy and Economics Desired by Financial Advisors. We believe many financial advisors have entrepreneurial aspirations and are attracted to the flexibility and control of the independent financial advisor model. Independent financial advisors also enjoy a greater share of the brokerage commissions and advisory fees than financial advisors at the employee model firms  generally 80-90% compared to 30-50%. Our Business With our focus and scale, we are not only a beneficiary of the secular shift among advisors toward independence, but an active catalyst of this trend. Between 2004 and 2008, our number of advisors increased at a CAGR of 20%, while according to Cerulli Associates, the total number of advisors across all channels remained flat. We enable our advisors to provide their clients with high quality independent financial advice and investment solutions, and support our advisors in managing the complexity of their businesses by providing a leading integrated platform of technology and clearing services. We provide these services through an open architecture product platform with no proprietary manufactured products, which enables an unbiased, conflict-free environment. Additionally, we offer our advisors the highest average payout ratios among the five largest U.S. broker-dealers, as ranked by number of advisors. Our business is dedicated exclusively to our advisors; we are not a market-maker nor do we offer investment banking or underwriting services. 70 Table of Contents The size of our organization and scalability of our solutions allow us to continually reinvest in our technology and clearing platforms, tailor our services to the needs of our advisors and provide them with an attractive value proposition. We believe that our technology and service platforms allows our advisors to spend more time with their clients and enhance and grow their businesses. Our revenues are derived primarily from commissions and fees generated by our advisors. We also generate asset-based fees from our financial product sponsor relationships, our cash sweep programs and sub-transfer agency and networking services. Under our self-clearing platform, we custody the majority of client assets invested in these products, which includes providing statements, transaction processing and ongoing account management for which we receive a fee. Our Financial Advisors Serving clients in communities across the nation, our advisors build long-term relationships with their clients by guiding them through the complexities of investment decisions, retirement solutions, financial planning and wealth-management. We support the evolution of our advisors businesses over time and provide a range of solutions as their needs change. The relationship with our advisors is embodied in our Commitment Creed, which serves as a set of guiding principles for our relationships with our advisors. For more than 20 years it has been ingrained in our culture and reflects our singular focus on the advisors we serve. The size and growth of our business has benefited from this focus. Our advisor base has grown from 3,569 advisors in 2000 to 12,026 as of March 31, 2010, representing a CAGR in excess of 14%. Our advisor base includes independent financial advisors, RIAs and advisors at small and mid-sized financial institutions. In order to license with us, advisors must meet our stringent requirements which include a thorough review of the advisors education, experience, credit and compliance history. Advisors that join us average over 15 years of industry experience. This substantial industry experience allows us to focus on enhancing our advisors businesses without the need for basic training or subsidizing advisors that are new to the industry. Our independent advisors join us from a broad range of firms including wirehouses, regional and insurance broker dealers, banks and other independent firms. Our flexible business platform allows our advisors to choose the most appropriate business model to support their clients, whether they conduct brokerage business, offer brokerage and fee-based services on our corporate RIA platforms or provide fee-based services through their own RIAs. Our independent advisors and RIAs are entrepreneurial independent contractors who market their services through 4,000 branch offices. They are primarily located in rural and suburban areas and as such are viewed as local providers of independent advice. Approximately 70% of these advisors operate under their own brand name. We approve and assist these advisors with their own branding, marketing and promotion. Among our 12,000 advisors, we support over 2,400 advisors at over 750 banks and credit unions seeking to provide a broad array of services for their financial advisors. For these institutions, whose core capabilities may not include investment and financial planning services, or who find the technology, infrastructure and regulatory requirements to be cost prohibitive, we provide their financial advisors with the services they need to be successful, allowing the institutions to focus their energy and capital on their core businesses. We also provide support to over 4,000 additional financial advisors who are affiliated and licensed with insurance companies. These outsourcing arrangements provide customized clearing, advisory platforms and technology solutions that enable financial advisors at these insurance companies to efficiently provide a breadth of services to their client base. 71 Table of Contents Our Service Value Proposition The core of our business is dedicated to meeting the evolving needs of our advisors and providing the platform and tools to grow and enhance the profitability of their businesses. We support our advisors by providing front, middle and back-office solutions through the four pillars of our distinct value proposition: enabling technology, comprehensive clearing and compliance services, practice management programs and training, and independent research. The comprehensive and automated nature of our offering enables our advisors to focus on their clients while successfully and efficiently managing the complexities of running their own practice. Advisors affiliated with us demonstrate greater loyalty to us than advisors affiliated with other broker-dealers based on the Net Promoter Scores as reflected in a recent study prepared on our behalf by a management consulting firm. A companys Net Promoter Score is based on a customers likelihood to recommend the companys product or service. Our Net Promoter Score of 61% was 29 points higher than the average of other broker-dealers. Enabling Technology We provide our technology and service to advisors through BranchNet, our proprietary, integrated technology platform that is server-based and web-accessed. Using the BranchNet workstation, our advisors effectively manage all critical aspects of their businesses while remaining highly efficient and responsive to their clients needs. Time-consuming processes, such as account opening and management, document imaging, transaction execution, and account rebalancing, are automated to improve efficiency and accuracy. Substantially all of our advisors utilize BranchNet as their core technology platform. Through BranchNet, our advisors have direct access to a fully-integrated array of tools and support systems, including:  comprehensive account lookup for accounts and direct business data;  straight-through processing of trade orders and account maintenance requests and  secure and reliable data maintenance In addition to the account management capabilities of BranchNet, the Resource Center, embedded within BranchNet, provides advisors with access to our research, training, compliance and support services and the ability to review products and develop marketing materials.  direct access to financial product information, exclusive research commentaries, detailed regulatory requirements, valuable marketing tools, operational details, comprehensive training and technical support;  client management and business development tools;  trading and research tools and  business management resources. Many advisors also subscribe to premium features, such as performance reporting, financial planning and customized websites. Select third-party resources have been integrated into our technology software, enabling seamless access to important tools, broadening our range of offerings and reducing duplicate operational functions. We believe BranchNet allows our advisors to transact and monitor their business more efficiently, lowering operating costs for their business. Once on BranchNet, advisors have the ability to choose which services suit their business plan, purchasing only the services that are needed to grow their business. 72 Table of Contents Comprehensive Clearing and Compliance Services We custody and clear the majority of our advisors transactions, providing an enhanced advisor experience and expedited processing capabilities. Our self-clearing platform enables us to better control client data, more efficiently process and report trades, facilitate platform development, reduce costs and ultimately enhance the quality of the services we provide our advisors. Our self-clearing platform also enables us to serve a wider variety of advisors, including RIAs and hybrid RIAs. Because we are self-clearing, we can address all facets of securities transaction processing, including:  order routing, trading support, execution and clearing, and position keeping;  regulatory and tax compliance and reporting and  investment accounting and recordkeeping. All of these services are backed by our service center and operations organizations focused on providing timely, accurate and consistent support, with each employee committed to delivering best in class service. This shared commitment allows us to meet our financial advisors and institutions needs so they can best serve their clients. In 2010, we launched Service360, a new service paradigm for our most productive advisors. Service360 offers these advisors a wide array of organizational support. Service360 is a team-based approach to service, in which teams are dedicated to a defined set of advisors. Service360 is scheduled to be fully implemented by December 2010, at which time it will service over 4,000 advisors with timely accurate, and efficient service delivered in a more personal, relationship-focused manner and with greater accountability and ownership on the part of the service team. We have made sizeable investments in our compliance offering to enable our advisors to run a fully compliant office. Since 2000, our commitment of resources and focus on compliance have enabled us to maintain one of the best regulatory compliance records, based upon the number of regulatory events reported in FINRAs BrokerCheck Reports, among the five largest U.S. broker-dealers, ranked by number of advisors. Several years ago we made the strategic decision to fully integrate our compliance tools into our technology platform to further enhance compliance effectiveness and scalability. Over 300 employees assist our advisors through:  training advisors on new products, new FINRA guidelines, compliance tools, security policies and procedures, anti-money laundering and best practices;  review and approval of advertising materials;  technology-enabled surveillance of trading activities and sales practices;  oversight and monitoring of registered investment advisory activities;  securities registration, advisory and insurance licensing of advisors and  audits of branch offices. Practice Management Programs and Training Our practice management programs help our advisors enhance and grow their businesses. Our experience gives us the ability to benchmark the best practices of successful advisors and develop customized recommendations to meet the specific needs of an advisors business and market. Because of our scale, we are able to dedicate a experienced group of 91 professionals that work with our advisors to build and better manage their business and client relationships through one-on-one 73 Table of Contents consulting as well as group training. In addition, we hold 140 conferences and group training events annually for the benefit of our advisors. Our practice management and training services include:  personalized business consulting support that helps advisors enhance the value and operational efficiency of their businesses;  advisory and brokerage consulting to support advisors in growing their businesses with our broad range of products and fee-based offerings, as well as wealth management services to assist advisors serving high net worth clients with comprehensive estate, tax, philanthropic, and financial planning processes;  marketing campaigns and consultation to enable advisors to build awareness of their services and capitalize on opportunities in their local markets;  transition services to help advisors establish independent practices and migrate client accounts to us and  training programs on topics including technology, use of advisory platforms and business development. Independent Research We provide our advisors with integrated access to comprehensive proprietary research on mutual funds, separate accounts, insurance and annuities, asset allocation strategies, financial markets and the economy, among other areas. Our research team consists of over 25 professionals with an average of 12 years of industry experience, dedicated to providing unbiased and conflict-free advice. Our research is designed to empower our advisors to give their clients thoughtful advice in an efficient manner. In particular, our research facilitates the growth of our advisory platform through generation of model portfolio and asset allocation overlay services and the distribution of our packaged products. Our research team actively works with our product diligence group in screening financial products offered through our platform. Our lack of proprietary products or investment banking services helps ensure that our research remains unbiased and objective. With a focus on performance, service and transparency, our research team utilizes a wide spectrum of available tools to deliver timely perspectives on the ever-changing economic marketplace and products, enabling advisors to help their clients understand and adjust to the latest developments. Through its objective recommendations and portfolio management, the research group helps advisors meet a broad range of investor needs effectively. Our research enables advisors to:  keep abreast of changes in markets and the global economy, through our daily market update call and email, published materials, blogs and media presence;  proactively respond to emerging trends;  leverage the expertise and experience of our research team in building individual investment portfolios that are fully integrated in our technology platform and  seek specific advice through our ASK (accurate, swift and knowledgeable) Research Service Desk, a team of research professionals dedicated exclusively to advisor investment-research inquiries via phone and email. A substantial portion of our research is compliance-approved so that advisors are able to share it with clients when working with them to make investment decisions. Our Economic Value Proposition We offer a compelling economic value proposition that is a key factor in our ability to attract and retain advisors. The independent channels pay advisors a greater share of brokerage commissions and advisory fees than the captive channels  generally 80-90% compared to 30-50%. Because of 74 Table of Contents our scale and efficient operating model, we offer our advisors the highest average payout ratios among the five largest U.S. broker-dealers, ranked by number of advisors. We believe our superior technology and service platforms enable our advisors to operate their practices at a lower cost than other independent advisors. As a result, we believe owners of practices associated with us earn meaningfully more pre-tax profit than owners of practices affiliated with other independent brokerage firms. We attribute this difference in profitability in part to lower fixed costs driven by the need for fewer staff at our associated practices. Finally, as business owners, independent financial advisors, unlike captive advisors, also have the opportunity to build equity in their own businesses. We also believe our solutions enable our financial institutions to be more productive and therefore generate greater profitability relative to other financial institutions supported by third party firms. Our Product Access We do not manufacture any financial products. Instead, we provide our advisors open architecture access to a unique variety of commission, fee-based, cash and money market products and services. Our product diligence group conducts extensive diligence on substantially all of the new products we offer, including annuities, real estate investment trusts, alternative investments and mutual funds. Our platform provides access to over 8,500 financial products, manufactured by over 400 product sponsors. The sales and administration of these products are facilitated through BranchNet and Resource Center, which allow our advisors to access client accounts, product information, asset allocation models, investment recommendations, and economic insight as well as perform trade execution. As of March 31, 2010, advisory and brokerage assets totaled $285 billion, of which $81 billion was in advisory assets. In 2009, brokerage sales were over $28 billion, including over $10 billion in mutual funds and $14 billion in annuities. Advisory sales were over $23 billion, which consisted primarily of mutual funds. As a result of this scale and significant distribution capabilities, we can offer leading products and services with attractive economics to our advisors. Commission-Based Products Commission-based products are those for which we and our advisors receive an up front commission and, for certain products, a trailing commission. Our brokerage offerings include variable and fixed annuities, mutual funds, general securities, alternative investments, retirement and 529 education savings plans, fixed income and insurance. Our insurance offering is provided through LPL Insurance Associates, Inc. (LPLIA), a brokerage general agency which provides personalized advance case design, point-of-sale service and product support for a broad range of life, disability and long-term care products. As of March 31, 2010, the total assets in our commission-based products were approximately $204 billion. Fee-Based Advisory Platforms and Support We have been an innovator in fee-based solutions since the introduction of our Strategic Asset Management platform in 1991. Today we have five fee-based advisory platforms that provide centrally managed or customized solutions from which advisors can choose to meet the investment needs of their mass affluent and high net worth clients. The fee structure aligns the interests of our advisors with their clients, while establishing a valuable recurring revenue stream for the advisor and for us. Our fee-based platforms provide access to no-load/load-waived mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, stocks, bonds, conservative option strategies, unit investment trusts and no-load, institutional money managers and multi-manager variable annuities. We provide third-party equity research and asset-management services. As of March 31, 2010, the total assets in these platforms was $81 billion. 75 Table of Contents Cash Sweep Programs We assist our advisors in managing their clients cash balances through two primary cash sweep programs depending on account type: a money market sweep vehicle involving multiple money market fund providers and an insured bank deposit sweep vehicle. Our insured bank deposit sweep vehicle allocates client cash balances across multiple non-affiliated banks to provide advisors with up to $1.5 million ($3.0 million joint) of insurance through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). As of March 31, 2010, the total assets in our cash sweep programs, which are held within brokerage and advisory accounts, exceeded $18 billion. In addition to the products above, we also offer trust, investment management and custodial services for estates and families through our subsidiary PTC. Our Financial Model We have a proven track record of strong financial performance. We have increased our annual Adjusted EBITDA for the past nine consecutive years with only two declines in annual revenue in 2001 and 2009, both in conjunction with major market downturns. We have experienced greater variability in our net income primarily due to amortization of purchased assets and interest expense from our senior secured credit facilities and subordinated notes, both a result of our leveraged buyout transaction in 2005, as well as acquisition integration and restructuring initiatives. As we demonstrated during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, our financial model has inherent resilience, and our overall financial performance is a function of the following favorable characteristics: Our financial model has numerous, attractive financial characteristics:  Our revenues stem from diverse sources, including advisor-generated commission and advisory fees as well as fees from product manufacturers, recordkeeping, cash sweep balances and other ancillary services. They are not concentrated by advisor, product or geography. For the year ended December 31, 2009, no single relationship with our independent advisor practices, banks, credit unions, or insurance companies accounted for more than 3% of our net revenues, and no single advisor accounted for more than 1% of our net revenues.  Furthermore, a majority of our revenue base is recurring in nature.  Our expenses are primarily variable, as they consist principally of payouts on advisor-generated revenues.  Our profit margins are stable and should expand over time because we actively manage our general and administrative expenses.  We are able to operate with low capital expenditures and limited capital requirements, and as a result our cash flow is not encumbered.  We generate substantial free cash flow which we reinvest into our business. We have demonstrated the resilience of our financial model through market downturns, particularly in the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. This inherent resilience is a function of the following dynamics of our business:  A significant proportion of our revenues are not correlated with the equity financial markets, such as software licensing, account and client fees.  The variable component of our cost base is directly linked to revenues generated by our advisors. Furthermore, the payout percentages are tied to advisor productivity levels.  Our general and administrative expenses can be actively managed. 76 Table of Contents Our Competitive Strengths  Significant Scale and Market Leadership Position. We are an established leader in the independent advisor market, which is our core business focus. Our scale enables us to benefit from the following dynamics:  We actively reinvest in our leading technology platform and practice support, which further improves the productivity of our advisors.  As one of the largest distributors of financial products in the United States, we are able to obtain attractive economics from product manufacturers.  Among the five largest U.S. broker-dealers by number of advisors, we offer the highest average payout ratios to our advisors. The combination of our ability to reinvest in the business and maintain highly competitive payout ratios allows us to attract and retain advisors successfully. This, in turn, drives our growth and leads to a virtuous cycle that reinforces our established scale advantage.  Unique Value Proposition for Independent Advisors. We deliver a comprehensive and integrated suite of products and services to support the practices of our independent advisors. We believe we are the only institution that offers a conflict-free, open architecture and scalable platform. The benefits of our purchasing power lead to high payouts and greater economics to the advisors. Our platform also creates an entrepreneurial opportunity that empowers independent advisors to build equity in their businesses. This generates a significant opportunity to attract and retain highly qualified advisors who are seeking independence.  Unique Value Proposition for Institutions. We provide solutions to financial institutions, such as regional banks, credit unions and insurers, who seek to provide a broad array of services for their customers. We believe many institutions find the technology, infrastructure and regulatory requirements associated with delivering financial advice to be cost-prohibitive. We provide comprehensive solutions that enable financial advisors at these institutions to offer financial advice.  Ability to Profitably Serve the Mass-Affluent Market. Since inception, our core focus has been on advisors who serve the mass-affluent market. We have designed and integrated all aspects of our platforms and services to profitably meet the needs of these advisors. We believe there is an attractive opportunity in the mass-affluent market, in part because wirehouses have not historically focused on the mass affluent market. We believe our scale position will sustain and strengthen our competitive advantage in the mass-affluent market.  Ability to Serve a Broad Range of Advisor Models. As a result of our integrated technology platform and the resulting flexibility, we are able to attract and retain advisors from multiple channels, including wirehouses, regional broker-dealers and other independent broker-dealers. This platform serves a variety of independent advisor models, including independent financial advisors, RIAs and hybrid-RIAs. Additionally, we are able to give our advisors flexibility in choosing how they conduct their business. This enables us to better retain our existing advisor base by facilitating their ability to transition among independent advisor models as preferences evolve within the market. In addition, although we have grown through our focus on the mass affluent market, the breadth of our platform has facilitated growing penetration of the high net worth market. As of March 31, 2010 our advisors supported accounts with more than $1 million in assets that in the aggregate represented $42.2 billion in advisory and brokerage assets, or 15% of our total. Although our advisors average production is typically below that of some of the wirehouse channel firms, our array of integrated technology and services supports advisors with significant production. In the 2010 rankings of the Top 1,000 Financial Advisors in Barrons survey, thirty-one of our advisors appeared in the 77 Table of Contents top 1,000 and three in the top 100. In addition, we ranked fifth in the number of advisors included in the ranking.  Experienced and Committed Senior Management Team. We have an experienced and committed senior management team that provides stable and long-standing leadership for our business. On average, our senior management has 26 years of industry experience. The team has a track record of success as demonstrated in the companys financial performance through the recent market downturn. As the current management team has played a significant role in building out the business, they have a fundamental understanding of the operations from the ground up. The management team is aligned with stockholders and holds significant equity ownership in the company. Our Sources of Growth We expect to increase our revenue and profitability by benefiting from favorable industry trends and by executing strategies to accelerate our growth beyond that of the broader markets in which we operate. Favorable Industry Trends  Growth in Investable Assets. According to Cerulli Associates, total assets under management in the United States is anticipated to grow at 7% per year over the next 4 years and retirement assets are expected to grow 8% from 2008 to 2014 (in part due to the retirement of the baby boomer generation and the resulting assets which are projected to flow out of retirement plans and into individual retirement accounts). In addition, individual retirement account rollovers are projected to double, growing from $3.6 trillion as of 2008 to $6.8 trillion by 2014.  Increasing Demand for Independent Financial Advice. Retail investors, particularly in the mass affluent market, are increasingly seeking financial advice from independent sources. We are highly focused on helping independent advisors meet the needs of the mass-affluent market, which constitutes a significant portion of investable assets, according to Cerulli Associates, and we believe presents significant opportunity for growth.  Advisor Migration to Independence. Independent channels are gaining market share from captive channels. We believe that we are not just a beneficiary of this secular shift, but an active catalyst in the movement to independence.  Macroeconomic Trends. As the macroeconomic environment continues to stabilize, we anticipate an appreciation in asset prices and a rise in interest rates from current, historically low levels. We expect that our business will benefit from growth in advisory and brokerage assets as well as increasing asset-based and cash sweep fees. LPL-Specific Growth Opportunities  Attracting New Advisors to Our Platform. We intend to grow the number of advisors  either independent or with financial institutions  who are served by our platform. Based on the number of financial advisors, we have only 3.8% market share of the approximately 310,000 financial advisors in the United States, according to Cerulli Associates, and we have the ability to attract seasoned advisors of any practice size and from any channel, including wirehouses, regional broker-dealers and other independent broker-dealers. Additionally, we are able to support a wide range of business models, including independent financial advisors, RIAs and hybrid-RIAs. This flexibility drives sustainable growth in new advisors who seek to transfer to our platform. We also expect to significantly expand our developing share of the RIA market. 78 Table of Contents  Ramp-up of Newly-Attracted Advisors. We predominately attract experienced advisors who have established practices. In our experience, it takes an average of three years for newly hired advisors to re-establish their practices and associated revenues. This seasoning process creates accelerated growth of revenue from new advisors.  Increasing Productivity of Existing Advisor Base. The productivity of advisors increases over time as we enable them to add new clients, gain shares of their clients investable assets, and expand their existing practices with additional advisors. We facilitate these productivity improvements by helping our advisors better manage their practices in an increasingly complex environment.  Our Business Model has Inherent Economies of Scale. The largely fixed costs necessary to support our advisors delivers higher marginal profitability as client assets and revenue grow. Historically, this dynamic has been demonstrated through the growth in our operating margins.  Opportunistic Pursuit of Acquisitions. We have a proven history of expanding our business through opportunistic acquisitions. In the past six years, we have successfully completed four transactions. Our scalable business model and operating platform make us an attractive acquirer in a fragmented market. Competition We believe we offer a unique and dedicated value proposition to independent financial advisors and financial institutions who are focused primarily on mass affluent investors. This value proposition is built upon the delivery of our services through our scale, independence and integrated technology, which we believe is not replicated in the industry, and as a result we do not have any direct competitors to our business model. For example, because we do not have any proprietary manufacturing products, we do not view firms that manufacture asset management products and other financial products as competitors. We compete to attract and retain experienced and productive advisors with a variety of financial firms. Within the independent channel, the industry is highly fragmented, comprised primarily of small regional firms that rely on third-party custodians and technology providers to support their operations. Within the captive wirehouse channel, which tends to consist of large nationwide firms with multiple lines of business, competitors include Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, & Smith Incorporated; UBS Financial Services Inc.; Wells Fargo Advisors, LLC; who typically focus on the highly competitive high net worth investor market. Competition for advisors also includes regional firms, such as Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P. and Raymond James Financial Services, Inc.. RIAs, who are licensed directly with the SEC and not through a broker-dealer, select third-party firms for custodial services, and competitors include Charles Schwab & Co. and Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC. Our competitors who do not offer a complete solution for advisors are frequently enabled by third-party firms. Pershing LLC, a subsidiary of Bank of New York Mellon, offers custodial services to independent firms who are not self-clearing and to RIAs. Other examples include Albridge Solutions, a subsidiary of PNC Financial Services LLC, Advent Software, Inc. and Morningstar, Inc., who provide an array of technology and research resources. Our advisors compete for clients with financial advisors of brokerage firms, banks, insurance companies, asset management and investment advisory firms. In addition, they also compete with a number of firms offering direct to investor on-line financial services and discount brokerage services, such as Charles Schwab & Co. and Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC. Employees As of March 31, 2010, we had 2,480 full-time employees. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with us. Our continued growth is 79 Table of Contents dependent, in part, on our ability to recruit and retain skilled technical sales and professional personnel. We believe that our relationship with our employees is strong. Our Corporate Structure LPL Investment Holdings Inc. is the parent company of our collective businesses. Our original broker-dealer, LPL Financial, was formed in 1989. In 2005, investment funds affiliated with Hellman & Friedman LLC and TPG Capital acquired a majority ownership stake in LPL Investment Holdings Inc., with the remaining interest owned primarily by our founders, senior management and advisors. In recent years we have grown our business through a number of opportunistic acquisitions. We strengthened our position as a leading independent broker-dealer through our acquisition of Pacific Select Group, LLC (renamed LPL Investment Advisory Services Group, LLC) and the Affiliated Entities in 2007. In September of 2009, we consolidated the operations of the Affiliated Entities with those of LPL Financial. The consolidation involved the transfer of securities licenses of certain registered representatives associated with the Affiliated Entities and their client accounts. Following the completion of these transfer activities, the registered representatives and client accounts that transferred are now associated with LPL Financial. Our acquisitions of UVEST and IFMG in 2007 further expanded our reach in offering financial services through banks, savings and loan institutions and credit unions nationwide. Our subsidiary, Independent Advisers Group Corporation (IAG), offers an investment advisory solution to insurance companies to support their financial advisors who are licensed with them. Our subsidiary, LPLIA, operates as a brokerage general agency which offers life, long-term care and disability insurance sales and services. Through our subsidiary PTC we offer trust, investment management and custodial services for estates and families. Regulation The financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by non-U.S. government agencies or regulatory bodies and securities exchanges. We take an active leadership role in the development of the rules and regulations that govern our industry. Given the recent turmoil in the financial services industry, we anticipate continued heightened scrutiny and significant modifications in these rules and regulations. We strive to be at the forefront of influencing this change. Throughout our history we have also invested heavily, with the benefit of our scale, in our compliance functions to monitor our compliance with the numerous legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business. Broker-Dealer Regulation LPL Financial, our wholly owned subsidiary, is a registered broker-dealer with the SEC, a member of FINRA, a member of various self-regulatory organizations and a participant in various clearing organizations including The Depository Trust Company, the National Securities Clearing Corporation and the Options Clearing Corporation. LPL Financial is registered as a broker-dealer in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our subsidiaries UVEST, MSC, Associated and WFG are also registered broker-dealers with the SEC, and are members of FINRA. Similar to LPL Financial, UVEST conducts business on a national basis; however it acts as an introducing firm, using a third-party firm for securities clearing and custody functions. Prior to the consolidation of the Affiliated Entities, each broker-dealer also conducted business on a national basis as an introducing firm, using a third-party firm for securities clearing and custody functions. Broker dealers are subject to rules and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, public offerings, publication of research reports, use and safekeeping of clients funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping and reporting, and 80 Table of Contents the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Broker dealers are also regulated by state securities administrators in those jurisdictions where they do business. Compliance with many of the rules and regulations applicable to us involves a number of risks because rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations. Regulators make periodic examinations and review annual, monthly and other reports on our operations, track record and financial condition. Violations of rules and regulations governing a broker dealers actions could result in censure, penalties and fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, the suspension or expulsion from the securities industry of such broker dealer or its officers or employees, or other similar adverse consequences. The rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which are enforced by FINRA, apply to the municipal securities activities of LPL Financial, UVEST, MSC, Associated and WFG. Our margin lending is regulated by the Federal Reserve Boards restrictions on lending in connection with client purchases and short sales of securities, and FINRA rules also require such subsidiaries to impose maintenance requirements on the value of securities contained in margin accounts. In many cases, our margin policies are more stringent than these rules. Investment Adviser Regulation As investment advisers registered with the SEC, our subsidiaries LPL Financial, UVEST, the Affiliated Entities, and IAG are subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and the SECs regulations thereunder, as well as to examination by the SECs staff. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, performance fees, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation arrangements, conflicts of interest, advertising, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between the advisor and advisory clients, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements and general anti-fraud provisions. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to ERISA, and Sections 4975(c)(1)(A), (B), (C) or (D) of the Internal Revenue Code, and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they are a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients or otherwise deal with benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients (including, without limitation, employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans) and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment advisers registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines or other similar consequences. Commodities and Futures Regulation LPL Financial is licensed as a futures commission merchant (FCM) and commodity pool operator with the CFTC and is a member of the NFA. Although licensed as a FCM and a commodity pool operator, LPL Financials futures activities are limited to conducting business as a guaranteed introducing broker. LPL Financial is regulated by the CFTC and NFA. Violations of the rules of the CFTC and the NFA could result in remedial actions including fines, registration terminations or revocations of exchange memberships. As a guaranteed introducing broker, LPL Financial clears commodities and futures products through ADM Investor Services International Limited (ADM), and all commodities accounts and related client positions are held by ADM. Trust Regulation Through our subsidiary PTC we offer trust, investment management and custodial services for estates and families. PTC is chartered as a non-depository national banking association. As a limited purpose national bank, PTC is regulated and regularly examined by the OCC. PTC files reports with 81 Table of Contents the OCC within 30 days after the conclusion of each calendar quarter. Because the powers of PTC are limited to providing fiduciary services and investment advice, it does not have the power or authority to accept deposits or make loans. For this reason, trust assets under PTCs management are not insured by the FDIC. As PTC is not a bank as defined under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, neither its parent, PTC Holdings, Inc., nor PTC is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as a bank holding company. However, because it is subject to regulation by the OCC, PTC is subject to various laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as capital adequacy, change of control restrictions and regulations governing fiduciary duties, conflicts of interest, self-dealing and anti-money laundering. For example, the Change in Bank Control Act, as implemented by OCC supervisory policy, imposes restrictions on parties who wish to acquire a controlling interest in a trust company or the holding company of a trust company such as LPL Investment Holdings Inc. In general, an acquisition of 10% or more of our common stock, or an acquisition of control as defined in OCC regulations, would require OCC approval. These laws and regulations are designed to serve specific bank regulatory and supervisory purposes and are not meant for the protection of PTC, LPL or its stockholders. Regulatory Capital The SEC, FINRA, OCC, CFTC and the NFA have stringent rules and regulations with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by regulated entities. Generally, a broker-dealers net capital is net worth plus qualified subordinated debt less deductions for certain types of assets. The net capital rule under the Exchange Act requires that at least a minimum part of a broker-dealers assets be maintained in a relatively liquid form. Because we are a guaranteed introducing broker for commodities and futures that is also a registered broker-dealer, CFTC rules require us to comply with higher net capital requirements of the net capital rule under the Exchange Act. The SEC, FINRA and CFTC impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria. These rules also dictate the ratio of debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer, and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. If a broker-dealer fails to maintain the required net capital, it may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the applicable regulatory agency, and suspension or expulsion by these regulators ultimately could lead to the broker-dealers liquidation. Additionally, the net capital rule and certain FINRA rules impose requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital, and that require prior notice to the SEC and FINRA for certain capital withdrawals. All of our subsidiaries that are subject to net capital rules have been, and currently are, in compliance with those rules and have net capital in excess of the minimum requirements. Anti-Money Laundering The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the PATRIOT Act) contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various regulations applicable to broker-dealers, FCMs and other financial services companies. Financial institutions subject to the PATRIOT Act generally must have anti-money laundering procedures in place, implement specialized employee training programs, designate an anti-money laundering compliance officer and are audited periodically by an independent party to test the effectiveness of compliance. We have established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations. Privacy Regulatory activity in the areas of privacy and data protection continues to grow worldwide and is generally being driven by the growth of technology and related concerns about the rapid and widespread dissemination and use of information. We must comply with these information-related 82 Table of Contents regulations, including, but not limited to, the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, SEC Regulation S-P, the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, as amended, and the 2003 Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, to the extent they are applicable to us.

Properties Our corporate offices are located in Boston, Massachusetts where we lease approximately 36,000 square feet of space under a lease agreement that expires on June 30, 2012, and approximately 21,000 square feet of space under a lease agreement that expires on May 31, 2013, in San Diego, California where we lease approximately 407,000 square feet of space under lease agreements that expire starting on May 31, 2012, and Charlotte, North Carolina where we lease a total of approximately 238,000 square feet of space under lease agreements expiring on November 30, 2016 and February 28, 2017. Our subsidiary PTC, located in Cleveland, Ohio, leases approximately 6,000 square feet of space under a lease agreement that expires on March 31, 2012. Our subsidiary UVEST, located in Charlotte, North Carolina, leases approximately 42,000 square feet of space under a lease agreement that expires on December 31, 2013, all of which has been vacated. In 2009, UVEST moved into our corporate headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Our subsidiary MSC leases approximately 38,000 square feet of space in West Palm Beach, Florida under a lease agreement that expires February 28, 2018, included in this amount is approximately 25,000 square feet of vacated space. Our subsidiary WFG leases approximately 17,000 square feet of space in Itasca, Illinois under a lease agreement that expires June 30, 2016. Our subsidiary AFG leases approximately 24,000 square feet of space in El Segundo, California under a lease agreement that expires February 14, 2012, included in this amount is approximately 22,000 square feet of vacated space. We own approximately 4.5 acres of land in San Diego. We believe that our existing properties are adequate for the current operating requirements of our business and that additional space will be available as needed. Legal Proceedings We are presently and regularly involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business, including lawsuits, arbitration claims, regulatory and/or governmental subpoenas, investigations and actions, and other claims. Many of our legal proceedings are initiated by our advisors clients and involve the purchase or sale of investment securities. In connection with various acquisitions, and under the applicable purchase and sale agreement, we have received third-party indemnification for certain legal proceedings and claims. These matters have been defended and paid directly by the indemnifying party. On October 1, 2009, our subsidiary, LPL Holdings, Inc. (LPLH), received written notice from a third-party indemnitor under a certain purchase and sale agreement asserting that it is no longer obligated to indemnify the company for certain claims under the provisions of the purchase and sale agreement. We believe that this assertion is without merit and we have commenced litigation to enforce our indemnity rights. 83 Table of Contents We believe, based on the information available at this time, after consultation with counsel, consideration of insurance, if any, and the indemnifications provided by the third-party indemnitors, notwithstanding the assertions by an indemnifying party noted in the preceding paragraph, that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We cannot predict at this time the effect that any future legal proceeding will have on our business. Given the current regulatory environment and our business operations throughout the country, it is likely that we will become subject to further legal proceedings. Our ultimate liability, if any, in connection with any future such matters is uncertain and is subject to contingencies not yet known. 84 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT Executive Officers and Directors The following table sets forth the name, age and position of each of our executive officers and directors as of May 31, 2010: Name Age Position Mark S.

Our certificate of incorporation that will become effective upon the closing of this offering provides that at the first annual meeting after the first date on which the Majority Holders cease to own at least 40% of the outstanding common stock, the Board shall be divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. For as long as the Majority Holders continue to own 40% or more of the outstanding common stock, directors may be removed with or without cause by holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock. Following the first time when the Majority Holders collectively cease to own at least 40% of the outstanding common stock and our Board is divided into three classes as described above, our directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

That alignment has been achieved principally by ensuring that a significant portion of compensation is directly related to the financial strength and sustainability of our firm. We believe that this philosophy of seeking to align the interests of our executive management with those of stockholders has been a key contributor to the growth and successful performance of our firm. In addressing compensation, the Compensation Committee attempts to balance short-term and long-term components to properly reward performance, encourage retention and align executive pay with that of executives at comparable companies in our industry. The elements of our executive compensation program are base salary, annual cash bonus, and a long-term equity incentive program. In setting executive compensation levels, consideration is given to the totality of the compensation rather than individual elements. Total executive compensation, including equity-based compensation, is highly dependent on performance, experience, responsibility and our financial results. A significant portion of each executives compensation is variable and directly dependent upon performance against pre-determined corporate goals. Role of Compensation Committee Our Compensation Committee is composed entirely of independent directors under applicable listing standards and is responsible for establishing and overseeing our compensation philosophy and our executive compensation policies and programs. Our Compensation Committee reviews and approves the total compensation payable to each member of the executive management committee. The Compensation Committees charter sets forth the Compensation Committees responsibilities. The Compensation Committee recommends any revisions to such charter to the board of directors for approval. Role of Executive Officers Our chief executive officer annually reviews the individual performance of each of his direct reports, including the other named executive officers, and provides the Compensation Committee with evaluations of each such direct report as well as recommendations regarding such persons base salary level, annual cash bonus, and long term equity award. Our chief executive officer and our managing director, human capital attend Compensation Committee meetings (although they leave the meetings during discussions of compensation actions affecting them personally) and assist the Compensation Committee in determining the final compensation levels for our named executive officers. Role of Compensation Consultants In establishing total target compensation levels for our executive officers, the Compensation Committee determines the ranges of market compensation that it believes will enable us to effectively compete for and retain high performing, qualified executives. During 2009, Hewitt Associates and McLagan Inc. (together, the Compensation Consultants) were engaged by the company to provide executive compensation consulting services to the Compensation Committee and management. The Compensation Consultants provided us with a benchmark review of executive compensation based on a select group of financial services companies with similar operating characteristics and 95 Table of Contents market capitalization to us, which we refer to as our peer group. The intent of this review was to provide us with insight on market compensation practices and program designs with respect to base salary and short- and long-term incentives for companies comparable to us. We used this review in our discussions with the Compensation Committee when setting compensation for our named executive officers. The companies within the peer group consist of: Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Jeffries Group, Inc. Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Knight Capital Group, Inc. Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. MF Global Holdings Ltd Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. National Financial Planners Pty Ltd DST Systems, Inc. Penson Worldwide, Inc. E*Trade Financial Corp. Raymond James Financial, Inc. Fidelity National Information Systems SEI Investments Company Fiserv, Inc. Stifel Financial Corp. GFI Group Inc. TD Ameritrade Inc. Investment Technology Group, Inc. Waddell & Reed Inc. As companies comprising our peer group change due to merger, acquisition, market capitalization or business model, the Compensation Committee will consider appropriate changes to the group. Our goal is to ensure that we continue to measure our compensation practices against organizations from which we may recruit key executives, or otherwise consider as important benchmarks in our industry. Base Salary We believe that the base salary element is required in order to provide our named executive officers with a stable income stream that is commensurate with their responsibilities and the competitive market conditions. The base salaries of the named executive officers are set based on the responsibilities of the individual, taking into account the individuals skills, experience, prior compensation levels, and market compensation for our peer group. We review base salary for the named executive officers annually. Bonus We establish annual cash bonus opportunities for our named executive officers based on proposed goals, prior compensation levels, and market compensation for comparable positions within our peer group. We believe that these cash bonuses provide a significant incentive to our named executive officers to work towards achieving our company objectives as they are tied to certain of our key performance measures. These cash bonuses are discretionary as to the amount, timing, and conditions, subject to the terms of the plan under which they are awarded and the named executive officers employment agreement. For 2009, cash bonuses were issued to Mr. Casady and Ms. Stearns pursuant to our LPL Investment Holdings Inc. and Affiliates 2009 Corporate Executive Bonus Plan. The other named executive officers received cash bonuses in 2009 from our general employee bonus pool. In 2010, we expect to grant cash bonuses to our named executive officers under the LPL Investment Holdings Inc. and Affiliates Corporate Executive Bonus Plan and our general employee bonus pool. Our Compensation Committee evaluates our cash bonus award opportunities with the goal of setting the total target compensation opportunity for each named executive officer at a level the Compensation Committee believes represents the value the named executive officer contributes to our success, based on his or her performance, and maintains a competitive position with our peer group. Our bonus awards tie a significant portion of the overall compensation of each named executive officer to key corporate objectives and stated financial goals of our company, which are established annually. We determine whether the target bonuses are paid based on the companys performance 96 Table of Contents and profitability. We have the discretion, subject to the terms of the various bonus awards and applicable employment agreements, to pay bonuses below the established amounts. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the target dollar amount for the annual cash bonus for each of our named executive officers, based on 100% achievement of the metric targets discussed below, were as follows: Mark S. Casady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer $ 1,226,500 Esther M. Stearns, President and Chief Operating Officer $ 591,250 Robert J. Moore, Chief Financial Officer $ 350,000 William E. Dwyer, President, National Sales and Marketing $ 288,750 Stephanie L. Brown, Managing Director, General Counsel $ 187,000 Our chief executive officer met with the Compensation Committee in February 2010 to discuss our actual achievement compared to our 2009 corporate objectives. The Compensation Committee determined that the 2009 metric targets were fully achieved and awarded cash bonuses for each named executive officer in the following amounts: Mark S. Casady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer $ 1,500,000 Esther M. Stearns, President and Chief Operating Officer $ 650,000 Robert J. Moore, Chief Financial Officer $ 350,000 William E. Dwyer, President, National Sales and Marketing $ 450,000 Stephanie L. Brown, Managing Director, General Counsel $ 300,000 This determination was based on an analysis of the factors set forth in the table below. Strategic Objectives Performance  Achieve $353.4 million in Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA of $356.1 million achieved  Articulate an overarching service philosophy to improve support to advisors  Succeeded in improving and articulating service philosophy to our advisors  Shift to a Net Promoter Score focus  Successfully shifted corporate focus to Net Promoter Score  Deliver programs to increase accuracy, quality and accountability in broker-dealer support services  Successfully delivered programs increasing accuracy, quality and accountability in broker-dealer support services  Maintain SOX compliance and enhance existing risk management programs  Improved SOX compliance processes and enhanced risk management programs The metrics used to determine corporate performance may vary from year-to-year as our strategy and plans change. For 2010, the financial performance metric used for determining bonus payments will be Adjusted EBITDA. Long-Term Equity Incentive Program The purpose of our Long-Term Equity Incentive Program is to retain key executives and incentivize achievement of goals that drive long-term stockholder value. We provide stock-based, long-term compensation for named executive officers through our stockholder-approved equity plans. Stock options entitle the holder to purchase during a specified time period, a fixed number of shares of our common stock at a set price. The plans provide for stock options and other types of awards, including cash, which vest over a period determined by the Compensation Committee. The named executives officers currently have awards outstanding under the 2005 Stock Option Plan for Non-Qualified Stock Options, the 2005 Stock Option Plan for Incentive Stock Options and the 2008 Stock Option Plan (the Current Plans). By the terms of the Current Plans, no new awards may be granted following an initial public offering. 97 Table of Contents To replace the Current Plans after the completion of the initial public offering, we anticipate adopting an omnibus equity incentive plan that will permit the granting of various types of awards to our key employees, directors, consultants and advisors. Types of awards that may be granted are: stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, unrestricted stock, stock units, restricted stock units, performance awards, cash awards and other awards that are convertible into or otherwise based on stock. The Compensation Committee determines the number of stock options to be granted based on a holistic assessment of current and prospective contribution of value by each individual. Stock options are awarded from time to time to eligible recipients. The Compensation Committee does not use a formula regarding grants of stock options. The Compensation Committee also allocates stock options under our equity plans for use in attracting new executives. 162(m) Policy Prior to the consummation of this offering, we have been subject to the limits on deductibility of compensation set forth in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 162(m) denies publicly-held companies a tax deduction of annual compensation in excess of $1 million paid to their chief executive officer or any of their three other most highly compensated executive officers (other than the chief financial officer) employed on the last day of a given year, unless their compensation is based on qualified performance criteria. Subject to certain transition rules, to qualify for deductibility, these criteria must be established by a committee of independent directors and approved, as to their material terms, by that companys stockholders. We intend to structure our bonus and long-term equity incentive programs so that they qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m). However, our Compensation Committee may approve compensation or changes to plans, programs or awards that may cause the compensation or awards not to comply with Section 162(m) if it determines that such action is appropriate and in our best interests. Employment Agreements We have entered into definitive employment agreements with certain members of senior management including Mr. Casady, Ms. Stearns, Mr. Dwyer, and Ms. Brown. These employment agreements were executed in connection with the acquisition of our Company by investment funds affiliated with Hellman & Friedman LLC and TPG Capital in December 2005. These agreements had an initial term of three years and automatically renew for subsequent one-year terms unless we provide written notice within 90 days prior to the completion of the then-current term. We have not entered into a written employment agreement with Mr. Moore. We expect to enter into new employment agreements with each of our named executive officers prior to the completion of our initial public offering. The employment agreements required us to adopt option plans under which our employees are eligible to receive awards of stock options for our common stock. See  Long-Term Equity Incentive Program. In addition to the terms of his employment agreement set forth below, Mr. Casady is entitled to serve on the board of directors and, at least until an initial public offering, shall be the chairman of the board of directors. Employment Arrangements with Named Executive Officers Base Salaries Mr. Casady, Ms. Stearns, Mr. Moore, Mr. Dwyer, and Ms. Brown receive an annual base salary for the 2010 fiscal year of no less than $800,000, $625,000, $600,000, $500,000, and $375,000, 98 Table of Contents respectively. The agreements provide that each such executive officer is entitled to participate in the bonus plan that we may establish from time to time and in our equity incentive plans. Intellectual Property, Confidentiality, and Non-Compete Clauses The employment agreements with Mr. Casady, Ms. Stearns, Mr. Dwyer, and Ms. Brown require each of them to promptly disclose and assign any individual rights that he or she may have in any intellectual property (including concepts and business opportunities) to us. The executive officers must also maintain confidentiality of all information that is confidential and proprietary to us, subject to customary exceptions. Under a non-compete provision, they may not engage in prohibited competitive conduct for a period of two years following termination of the employment agreement for any reason. This non-compete period is reduced to 18 months in the event of a termination as a result of which the executive officer is entitled to a severance payment calculated with a severance multiplier of 1.5. During this time, these executive officers (i) may not engage or participate in, directly or indirectly, any business or entity which is competitive with us, (ii) will refrain from soliciting existing and prospective targets, suppliers, advisors or employees to terminate their relationship with us and (iii) will refrain from diverting, or attempting to divert, from us or any of our subsidiaries any of our advisors, targets, suppliers or employees. Severance and Change-in-Control Payments Under the terms of our employment agreements with Mr. Casady, Ms. Stearns, Mr. Dwyer, and Ms. Brown, we may be obligated to make severance payments following the termination of their employment. These benefits are described below under  Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control. We, however, have no obligation to grant the executive officer any gross-up or other make-whole compensation for any tax imposed on payments made to the executive officers, including parachute payments. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation On November 19, 2008, we established an unfunded, unsecured deferred compensation plan to permit holders of stock options issued under the 2005 Stock Option Plan for Incentive Stock Options and 2005 Stock Option Plan for Non-Qualified Stock Options that were expiring in 2009 and 2010 to receive stock units of the 2008 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Stock units represent the right to receive one share of common stock upon distribution. Distribution will occur at the earliest of (a) a date in 2012 to be determined by the board of directors; (b) a change in control of the company; or (c) death or disability of the participant. The issuance of stock units, which occurred in December 2008, is not taxable for federal and state income tax purposes until the participant receives a distribution under the deferred compensation plan. 401(k) Plan We maintain a retirement savings plan, or a 401(k) Plan, for the benefit of all eligible employees, including our named executive officers (on the same basis as all eligible employees). Under the terms of the 401(k) Plan, employees may elect to make tax deferred compensation up to the statutorily prescribed limit. After one year of service, we match contributions in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) 20% of the amount designated by the employee for withholding and (b) 2% of the employees eligible compensation (the Employer Match). An employees interests in his or her deferrals are 100% vested when contributed. The 401(k) Plan is intended to qualify under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. As such, contributions to the 401(k) Plan and earnings on those contributions are not taxable to the employees until distributed from the 401(k) Plan, and all contributions are deductible by us when made. We provide this benefit to all of our eligible employees, and it is provided to our named executive officers on the same basis as all other eligible employees. 99 Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2009, we suspended the employer match. However, in January 2010, the Compensation Committee approved a special employer match (calculated as described above) to be applied to all eligible contributions for calendar year 2009 pursuant to the terms of the 401(k) Plan. In addition, in March 2010, the Employer Match was reinstated retroactive to January 1, 2010.

See  Stock Options. Amounts are based on a value of $23.41 per share, which we believe is the fair market value as of December 31, 2009. (4) Represents lump sum payment under employment agreements equal to the costs of COBRA coverage for the executive officer and his or her family for a one-year period. (5) Mr. Moore does not have an employment agreement, but was guaranteed a bonus for 2009 pursuant to his offer letter, as amended. (6) If the executives employment with us is terminated without cause or for good reason (as described further below) in connection with a change-in-control, he or she would also be eligible for the severance and COBRA reimbursement payments under the column titled Without Cause or For Good Reason. Termination without Cause or for Good Reason In accordance with the employment agreements with our named executive officers (except Mr. Moore), all compensation and benefits shall terminate on the date of employment termination. If a named executive officer is terminated without cause or terminates his or her employment for good 104 Table of Contents reason (the definition of which includes the termination within 30 days following the first anniversary of a change-in-control event and our non-renewal of such employment agreement), then we must pay the named executive officer, subject to such named executive officers compliance with post-termination obligations relating to confidentiality, intellectual property and non-competition (see  Employment Agreements  Employment Arrangements with Named Executive Officers  Intellectual Property, Confidentiality and Non-Compete Clauses), an amount equal to (1) the severance multiplier times the named executive officers base salary and target bonus for the year of termination and (2) any and all accrued but unpaid compensation, vacation and business expenses and (3) one-year of premiums (including administrative charges) of continued health and dental plan participation under COBRA by such executive and his dependents. For terminations without cause or for good reason, the severance multiplier is 1.5. Additionally, for two years following termination without cause or for good reason, the named executive officer will be eligible to continue participation under our group life, health, dental and vision plans in which the named executive officer was participating immediately prior to the date of termination. Cause under the employment agreements means:  the intentional failure to perform his or her duties or gross negligence or willful misconduct in the regular duties or other breach of fiduciary duty or material breach of the employment agreement that remains uncured after 30 days notice;  conviction for a felony; or  fraud, embezzlement or other dishonesty that has a material adverse effect on us. Change-in-control under the employment agreements, subject to certain exceptions, means the consummation of:  any consolidation or merger of the company with or into any other person, or any other similar transaction, whether or not we are a party thereto, in which our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction own directly or indirectly capital stock either (1) representing less than 50% of the equity interests or voting power of the company or the surviving entity or (2) that does not have directly or indirectly have the power to elect a majority of the entire Board or other similar governing body;  any transaction or series of transactions, whether or not we are a party thereto, after giving effect to which in excess of 50% is owned directly or indirectly by any person other than us and our affiliates or  a sale or disposition of all of our assets; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, a change-in-control does not include (1) an event described in the three bullets above if the stockholders entitled to vote immediately prior to the event own, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the voting stock of the resulting, surviving, or acquiring corporation or (2) an initial public offering. Termination Other than For Good Reason Except as provided below, upon termination by the executive other than for good reason, each executive officer party to an employment agreement is subject to a one-year non-compete covenant and is entitled to receive: (1) any and all accrued but unpaid compensation, vacation and business expenses and (2) a lump sum amount equal to one year of premiums (including administrative charges) of continued health and dental plan participation under COBRA by the executive and his dependents ((1) and (2) collectively Accrued Compensation). However, at the board of directors discretion, and subject to such named executive officers continuous compliance with post-termination restrictive covenants relating to confidentiality, intellectual property and non-competition (see  Employment Agreements  Employment Arrangements with Named Executive Officers  Intellectual Property, Confidentiality and Non-Compete Clauses), the named executive officer may be 105 Table of Contents entitled to receive the same benefits as if the executive were terminated without cause or for good reason, except that the relevant severance multiplier would be one, and the executive would be subject to a non-competition covenant for two years. Death, Disability and Retirement For each named executive officer party to an employment agreement, upon termination due to death, the named executive officers estate will be entitled to the named executive officers Accrued Compensation and a prorated portion of the current fiscal years target bonus. Upon termination for disability, which must have continued for six months during which the executive officer received full salary and benefits, defined as the inability of the named executive officer to perform substantially all of his duties for six months, the named executive officer will receive Accrued Compensation and prorated portion of current fiscal years target bonus. Upon termination of employment, resulting from retirement at minimum age of 65, the named executive officer will be entitled to Accrued Compensation. Stock Options In accordance with the named executive officers option agreements, unless otherwise agreed to by the company, unvested stock options are cancelled upon termination of employment. Unless the named executive officer is terminated for cause, vested options will be exercisable for (1) two years following termination of employment by reason of retirement, but not later than the option expiration date, (2) 12 months following death or disability, but in each case, not later than the option expiration date or (3) 90 days following termination in other cases, but not later than the option expiration date. In the event of a change-in-control, if the named executive officers stock options will not be assumed, substituted or cashed out, all outstanding unvested options will vest and become exercisable prior to the change-in-control. Upon consummation of the change-in-control event, all outstanding but unexercised options will be terminated. All stock options held by named executive officers as of December 31, 2009 were originally granted under our 2005 Stock Option Plan for Nonqualified Stock Options, 2005 Stock Option Plan for Incentive Stock Options and our 2008 Stock Option Plan. Board of Director Compensation In February 2010, our board of directors approved revisions to our non-affiliated director compensation policy. Non-affiliated directors receive a $50,000 annual retainer, a $1,500 attendance fee for each regular meeting, and a $750 attendance fee for each committee meeting. The Audit Committee Chairperson receives an additional $15,000 as part of his annual retainer while the Compensation Committee Chairperson receives an additional $10,000 as part of his annual retainer. Each other Audit Committee and Compensation Committee member receives an additional $3,000 as part of his annual retainer. Mr. Casady, Mr. Putnam, and the directors affiliated with our private equity owners do not receive any additional compensation for service as directors. In the past, grants of stock options have supplemented the compensation paid to our non-affiliated directors. In March 2010, we adopted the LPL Investment Holdings, Inc. Director Restricted Stock Plan (the Restricted Stock Plan) for our non-affiliated directors. Each non-affiliated director will receive an annual grant of restricted shares of Common Stock valued at $100,000, with vesting to occur on the second anniversary of the grant date. These grants of equity serve to further align our directors interests with the interests of our stockholders. 106 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the compensation each of the non-affiliated directors received from us for service on the board of directors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.

(2) Mr. Goldstein resigned from his position as director on July 24, 2009. (3) Mr. Haines resigned from his position as director on June 2, 2009. In addition to the payments disclosed in the table above, our directors are reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with their attendance at board and committee meetings. Risks Arising from Compensation Policies and Practices We have reviewed and evaluated the philosophy and standards on which our compensation plans have been developed and implemented across our company. It is our belief that our compensation programs do not encourage inappropriate actions by our executive officers. Specifically, we believe that our compensation plans and process avoid:  a compensation mix overly weighted toward annual bonus awards;  an excessive focus on stock option awards that would cause behavior to drive short-term stock price gains in lieu of long-term value creation and  unreasonable financial goals or thresholds that would encourage efforts to generate near-term revenue with an adverse impact on long-term success. We believe that our current business process and planning cycle fosters the following behaviors and controls that would mitigate the potential for adverse risk caused by the action of our executive officers:  we have defined processes for developing strategic and annual operating plans, approval of capital investments, internal controls over financial reporting, and other financial, operational and compliance policies and practices;  annual review of corporate and individual objectives of the executive officers to align these goals with our annual operating and strategic plans, achieve the proper risk reward balance, and do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking; 107 Table of Contents  incentive awards are based on a review of a variety of indicators, including both financial performance and strategic achievements, reducing the potential to concentrate on one indicator as the basis of an annual incentive award;  the mixes between fixed and variable, annual and long-term, and cash and equity compensation are designed to encourage strategies and actions that are in our long-term best interests;  discretionary authority by the Compensation Committee to adjust annual bonus funding and payments reduces business risk associated with our cash bonus program and  stock option awards vest over a period of time. As a result of the longer time horizon to receive the value of a stock option award, the prospect of short-term or risky behavior is mitigated. 108 Table of Contents CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons Prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we plan to adopt formal policies or procedures for the review, approval, or ratification of certain related party transactions that may be required to be reported under the SEC disclosure rules. Currently, such transactions are reviewed by management and where appropriate, have been (and will continue to be) reviewed by our Audit Committee (other than the committee members involved, if any) on a case-by-case basis. Agreements with Management We and certain members of senior management have entered into employment agreements. Certain of these terms and conditions are more fully described in Executive Compensation  Employment Arrangements. Stockholders Agreement We are currently party to a Stockholders Agreement dated December 28, 2005, among the company, certain investment funds affiliated with the Majority Holders, the founders, the executives who had entered into employment agreements as of that date and certain other holders of common stock. The agreement contains the following provisions among others:  a right of the Majority Holders to designate a certain number of directors to our board of directors and the boards of directors of our subsidiaries. Of the current nine members of each of the boards, the Majority Holders currently have the right to designate four of the directors. The Majority Holders also have the right to designate one independent director after consultation with our chief executive officer, if the selection is reasonably acceptable to the founders;  in the case of all transfers of shares, the transferee will be required to become a party to the stockholders agreement and the transferred shares will continue to be subject to the restrictions and provisions thereunder;  prior to an initial public offering, our right to repurchase our equity securities if an employee holders employment or service relationship with us is terminated;  the right of a holder of common stock to require us to purchase shares if an employee holders employment is terminated as a result of death, disability or retirement following the age of 65;  from and after December 28, 2009 and prior to an initial public offering, our right of first refusal over any shares of common stock proposed to be transferred by a holder to a third party other than a permitted transferee;  prior to an initial public offering, the ability of holders of common stock to tag-along their shares of common stock to sales by the Majority Holders on a pro-rata basis (the founders tag-along right provides for the ability to tag-along a number of shares equal to two times their pro-rata share of the shares being sold);  the ability of the Majority Holders to drag-along common stock under certain circumstances;  demand registration rights for the Majority Holders and founders and piggyback registration rights for certain holders of common stock (the founders piggyback registration right provides for the ability to register a number of shares equal to two times their pro-rata share of all of the shares being registered);  the restriction on our ability to, prior to an initial public offering, enter into any transaction with, or for the benefit of, any of our affiliates involving an aggregate consideration in excess of 109 Table of Contents $2 million, unless approved by a majority of the independent members of the board of directors;  restrictions on dividends, redemptions and repurchases with respect to common stock prior to an initial public offering subject to certain exceptions and  prior to an initial public offering, a preemptive right of certain holders of common stock to purchase a pro-rata portion of any new securities we offer. In connection with this offering, we intend to terminate this Stockholders Agreement. We plan to enter into a new agreement with the Majority Holders which will provide them, among other things, a right to designate a certain number of directors to our board of directors and demand and piggyback registration rights. Other Arrangements As of December 31, 2009, we had an aggregate principal amount of $1,925,042 in loans outstanding to employees. Interest on these loans is typically accrued monthly at the minimum federal rate prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service. Portions (and in some cases all) of these loans may be forgiven based on the achievement of performance objectives or tenure of employment. During the period since the beginning of our last fiscal year, we forgave loans in an aggregate amount of $1,260,492 to four of our employees upon such employees becoming executive officers of the company. AlixPartners, LLP (AlixPartners), a company majority-owned by one of our Majority Holders, provides our subsidiary, LPL Financial, with consulting services pursuant to an agreement for interim management and consulting services. LPL Financial paid $0.6 million, $4.2 million and $0.9 million to AlixPartners during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of common stock are subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that the company may designate and issue in the future. Equity Plans As of June 1, 2010 we had options to acquire 22,666,341 shares of common stock which are held by our employees, directors and advisors and warrants to acquire 38,815 shares of common stock to financial institutions. We have also issued stock units to certain of our employees under the 2008 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan which will entitle the holders to 2,823,452 shares of common stock upon the earlier to occur of the employees death or disability, a change in control of the company or a date in 2012 to be determined by the companys board of directors. In addition, under our Fifth Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Bonus Plan, certain of our advisors have restricted shares which will vest upon consummation of our initial public offering. Anti-takeover Effects of the Delaware General Corporation Law and Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws Our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that may delay, defer or discourage another party from acquiring control of us, some of which may only become effective when our Majority Holders collectively cease to beneficially own at least 40% or more of our outstanding common stock (such time referred to in this section as the triggering event). We expect that these provisions, which are summarized below, will discourage coercive takeover practices or inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with the board of directors, which we believe may result in an improvement of the terms of any such acquisition in favor of our stockholders. However, they may also discourage acquisitions that some stockholders may favor. Board of Directors Our certificate of incorporation provides that until the occurrence of the triggering event (as defined above), the number of directors shall not be increased without the consent of the Majority 113 Table of Contents Holders. The board of directors currently has nine members. In addition, the stockholders agreement that we expect to enter into will provide that the board of directors will not have more than nine members for so long as either Hellman & Friedman LLC and its affiliates or TPG Capital and its affiliates are entitled to appoint two directors under the stockholders agreement. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Stockholders Agreement. Potential Staggered Board Our certificate of incorporation provides that at the first annual meeting after the triggering event, the Board shall be divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. The classification of our Board could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, control of our company. Action by Written Consent Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that, before the triggering event, the stockholders may act by written consent without a meeting and that, following the triggering event, any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders at an annual meeting or special meeting of the stockholders may only be taken if it is properly brought before such meeting. Special Meeting of Stockholders and Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that, except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by (a) our chairman or vice chairman of the Board, (b) our president, (c) a majority of the board of directors through a special resolution, or (d) prior to the triggering event, the holders of 40% of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. In addition, following the occurrence of the triggering event described above, our bylaws will require advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of the stockholders, including the nomination of directors. Stockholders at an annual meeting may only consider the proposals specified in the notice of meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors, or by a stockholder of record on the record date for the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has delivered a timely written notice in proper form to our secretary, of the stockholders intention to bring such business before the meeting. These provisions could have the effect of delaying until the next stockholder meeting any stockholder actions that are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. Requirements for Removal and Interim Election of Directors At such time as our board of directors has been divided into three classes, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the directors may only be removed for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Vacancies and newly created directorships may be filled only by a vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even though less than a quorum, and not by the stockholders, except that, prior to a triggering event, such vacancies may be filled by a vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock. In addition, the certificate of incorporation provides that any vacancy created by the removal of a director by the stockholders shall only be filled by vote of a majority of the outstanding common stock. Our bylaws allow the presiding officer at a meeting of the stockholders to adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of meetings which may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the rules and regulations are not followed. These provisions may have the effect of deferring, delaying or discouraging hostile takeovers, or changes in control or management of our company. 114 Table of Contents Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws The DGCL provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on any matter is required to amend a corporations certificate of incorporation or bylaws, unless a corporations certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as the case may be, requires a greater percentage. Following the first time when the Majority Holders collectively cease to own at least of our outstanding common stock, our bylaws may be amended or repealed by a majority vote of our board of directors or the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Additionally, following the first time when the Majority Holders collectively cease to own at least of our outstanding common stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of the voting power which all our stockholders would be entitled to case in an election of directors is required to amend or repeal or to adopt any provision inconsistent with any of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described in this section. These provisions may have the effect of deferring, delaying or discouraging the removal of any anti-takeover defenses provided for in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws. Authorized but Unissued Shares The authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the listing standards of . These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate finance transactions, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued common stock and preferred stock could make more difficult, or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger, or otherwise. Business Combinations We have elected to not be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which regulates business combinations with interested stockholders. However, we have adopted a provision in our certificate of incorporation that includes provisions similar to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. Subject to certain exceptions, this provision prevents us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that the person became an interested stockholder, unless either the interested stockholder attained such status with the approval of our board of directors, the business combination is approved by our board of directors or holders of 66 2 / 3 % of our voting stock in a prescribed manner or the interested stockholder acquired at least 85% of our outstanding voting stock in the transaction in which it became an interested stockholder. A business combination includes, among other things, a merger or consolidation involving us and the interested stockholder and the sale of more than 10% of our assets. In general, an interested stockholder is any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person, but it does not include the Majority Holders, their respective affiliates and their respective direct or indirect transferees who acquire from them (other than in a registered public offering) 5% or more of our outstanding voting stock, as a result of which transfer the relevant transferee and its affiliates and associates hold 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. Listing We intend to apply to list our shares of common stock for quotation on under the symbol LPLA. 115 Table of Contents SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE Before this offering, there has not been a public market for our common stock. As described below, only a limited number of shares currently outstanding will be available for sale immediately after this offering due to contractual and legal restrictions on resale. Nevertheless, future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants, in the public market after the restrictions lapse, or the possibility of such sales, could cause the prevailing market price of our common stock to fall or impair our ability to raise equity capital in the future. Upon completion of this offering, we will have outstanding shares of our common stock, assuming no exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares and no exercise of options or warrants outstanding as of . Of these shares, all shares of our common stock sold in this offering will be freely tradable in the public market without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless these shares are held by our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Shares purchased by our affiliates may not be resold except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from registration, including the safe harbor under Rule 144 of the Securities Act described below. In addition, shares of common stock issued upon exercise of stock options granted under certain of our equity plans which are registered under Form S-8 will be freely tradable in the public market, subject to certain contractual and legal restrictions described below. The remaining shares of our common stock will be restricted securities, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. These restricted securities may be sold in the public market only pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from registration under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. These rules are summarized below. Subject to our stockholders agreement and the lock-up agreements described below and the provisions of Rule 144, these restricted securities will be available for sale in the public market as follows: Number of Shares Date of Availability for Sale Various times after the date of this prospectus pursuant to Rule 144 Various times beginning 180 days after the date of this prospectus Lock-Up Arrangements The company and its officers, directors, employees and certain stockholders, including the selling stockholders, who together hold an aggregate of shares of our common stock after the completion of this offering, have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to directly or indirectly sell or dispose of any shares of common stock (except for shares to be sold by the selling stockholders in this offering) or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of common stock for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus without the prior written consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated. In addition, certain holders who receive shares of common stock upon vesting of their restricted stock in connection with the initial public offering will be restricted from transferring such shares until the earlier of 180 days from the date of the initial public offering or March 15, 2011. For additional information, see Underwriting. Rule 144 In general, under Rule 144, immediately upon the completion of this offering, a person who is not our affiliate and has not been our affiliate at any time during the preceding three months will be entitled to sell any shares of our common stock that such person has held for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner other than one of our affiliates, without regard to 116 Table of Contents volume limitations. Sales of our common stock by any such person would be subject to the availability of current public information about us if the shares to be sold were held by such person for less than one year. Our affiliates who have beneficially owned shares of our common stock for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner other than another of our affiliates, would be entitled to sell within any three-month period those shares and any other shares they have acquired that are not restricted securities, provided that the aggregate number of shares sold does not exceed the greater of:  1% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding, which will equal approximately shares immediately after this offering and  the average weekly trading volume in our common stock on during the four calendar weeks preceding the date of filing of a Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities Pursuant to Rule 144 with respect to the sale. Sales under Rule 144 by our affiliates are also subject to manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us. Stock Plans We have filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options under our 2005 Stock Option Plan for Non-Qualified Stock Options, 2005 Stock Option Plan for Incentive Stock Options, 2008 Stock Option Plan and 2008 Advisor Incentive Plan. We plan to file another registration statement on Form S-8 to cover shares of common stock under our 2010 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan and 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Resale of these registered shares will occur only after the expiration of any applicable contractual lock-up periods. Registration Rights Subject to the lock-up agreements described above, certain holders of our common stock may demand that we register their shares under the Securities Act or, if we file another registration statement under the Securities Act other than a Form S-8 covering securities issuable under our equity plans or on Form S-4, may elect to include their shares of common stock in such registration. If these shares are registered, they will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. 117 Table of Contents MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income and estate tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock by Non-U.S. Holders (defined below). This summary does not purport to be a complete analysis of all the potential tax considerations relevant to Non-U.S. Holders of our common stock. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated or proposed thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change at any time, possibly on a retroactive basis. This summary assumes that shares of our common stock are held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code. This summary does not purport to deal with all aspects of U.S. federal income and estate taxation that might be relevant to particular Non-U.S. Holders in light of their particular investment circumstances or status, nor does it address specific tax considerations that may be relevant to particular persons (including, for example, financial institutions, broker-dealers, insurance companies, partnerships or other pass-through entities, certain U.S. expatriates, tax-exempt organizations, pension plans, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, persons in special situations, such as those who have elected to mark securities to market or those who hold common stock as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction, synthetic security or other integrated investment, persons that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, or holders subject to the alternative minimum tax). In addition, this summary does not address certain estate and gift tax considerations or considerations under the tax laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction. For purposes of this summary, a Non-U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of common stock that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not:  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;  a corporation or any other organization taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  an estate, the income of which is included in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or  a trust if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trusts administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of the trusts substantial decisions or (2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. If an entity that is classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds our common stock, the tax treatment of its partners will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and other entities that are classified as partnerships for United States federal income tax purposes and persons holding our common stock through a partnership or other entity classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes are urged to consult their own tax advisors. There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences described herein, and we have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, an opinion of counsel with respect to the U.S. federal income or estate tax consequences to a Non-U.S. Holder of the purchase, ownership or disposition of our common stock. THIS SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE TAX ADVICE. NON-U.S. HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME AND ESTATE TAXATION, STATE, LOCAL AND 118 Table of Contents NON-U.S. TAXATION AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS. Distributions on Our Common Stock As discussed under Dividend Policy above, we do not currently expect to pay dividends. In the event that we do make a distribution of cash or property with respect to our common stock, any such distributions generally will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. If a distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the excess will be treated as a tax-free return of the Non-U.S. Holders investment, up to such holders tax basis in the common stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as capital gain, subject to the tax treatment described below in Gain on Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Our Common Stock. Dividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax unless such Non-U.S. Holder provides us or our agent, as the case may be, with the appropriate IRS Form W-8, such as :  IRS Form W-8BEN (or successor form) claiming, under penalties of perjury, a reduction in withholding under an applicable income tax treaty, or  IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form) stating that a dividend paid on common stock is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States of the Non-U.S. Holder (in which case such dividend generally will be subject to regular graduated U.S. tax rates as described below). The certification requirement described above also may require a Non-U.S. Holder that provides an IRS form or that claims treaty benefits to provide its U.S. taxpayer identification number. Each Non-U.S. Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor about the specific methods for satisfying these requirements. A claim for exemption will not be valid if the person receiving the applicable form has actual knowledge or reason to know that the statements on the form are false. If dividends are effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States of the Non-U.S. Holder (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment), the Non-U.S. Holder, although exempt from the withholding tax described above (provided that the certifications described above are satisfied), will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such dividends on a net income basis in the same manner as if it were a resident of the United States. In addition, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a non-U.S. corporation and dividends are effectively connected with its trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment), such Non-U.S. Holder may be subject to an additional branch profits tax equal to 30% (unless reduced by an applicable income treaty) in respect of such effectively-connected income. If a Non-U.S. Holder is eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to an income tax treaty, such holder may obtain a refund or credit of any excess amount withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Gain on Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Our Common Stock Subject to the discussion below under the Section titled Recently Enacted Legislation Affecting Taxation of Our Common Stock Held By or Through Foreign Entities, in general, a Non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on gain realized upon such holders sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of shares of our common stock unless (i) such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition, and certain other conditions are met, (ii) we are or have been a United 119 Table of Contents States real property holding corporation, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code (a USRPHC), at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the disposition and the Non-U.S. Holders holding period the share our common stock, or (iii) such gain is effectively connected with the conduct by such Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder). If the first exception applies, the Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the amount by which such Non-U.S. Holders capital gains allocable to U.S. sources exceed capital losses allocable to U.S. sources during the taxable year of the disposition. If the third exception applies, the Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to such gain in the same manner as a U.S. Holder, unless otherwise provided in an applicable income tax treaty, and a Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes may also be subject to a branch profits tax with respect to such gain at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty). Generally, a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation only if the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. Although there can be no assurance, we believe that we are not, and do not anticipate becoming, a USRPHC. However, because the determination of whether we are a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of our U.S. real property relative to the fair market value of other business assets, there can be no assurance that we will not become a USRPHC in the future. Even if we become a USRPHC, a Non-U.S. Holder would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our common stock so long as our common stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market and such Non-U.S. Holder does not own and is not deemed to own (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than 5% of our common stock at any time during the shorter of the five year period ending on the date of disposition and the holders holding period. Recently Enacted Legislation Affecting Taxation of Our Common Stock Held By or Through Foreign Entities Recently enacted legislation generally will impose a United States federal withholding tax of 30% on dividends and the gross proceeds of a disposition of our common stock paid after December 31, 2012 to a foreign financial institution (as specially defined under these rules), unless such institution enters into an agreement with the United States government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the United States tax authorities substantial information regarding United States account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with United States owners). The legislation also will generally impose a United States federal withholding tax of 30% on dividends and the gross proceeds of a disposition of our common stock paid after December 31, 2012 to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the direct and indirect United States owners of the entity. The scope of these requirements remains unclear and potentially subject to material changes resulting from any future guidance. Under certain circumstances, a non-United States holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes. Prospective investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in our common stock. Non-U.S. holders are urged to consult their own advisors about the new requirements and the effect that such new requirements may have on them. Backup Withholding and Information Reporting Subject to the discussion in the preceding paragraph, we must report annually to the IRS and to each Non-U.S. Holder the gross amount of the distributions on our common stock paid to such holder 120 Table of Contents and the tax withheld, if any, with respect to such distributions. Non-U.S. holders may have to comply with specific certification procedures to establish that the holder is not a U.S. person (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) in order to avoid backup withholding at the applicable rate, currently 28% and scheduled to increase to 31% for taxable years 2011 and thereafter, with respect to dividends on our common stock. Dividends paid to Non-U.S. Holders subject to the U.S. withholding tax, as described above in Distributions on Our Common Stock, generally will be exempt from U.S. backup withholding. Information reporting and backup withholding will generally apply to the proceeds of a disposition of our common stock by a Non-U.S. Holder effected by or through the U.S. office of any broker, U.S. or foreign, unless the holder certifies its status as a Non-U.S. Holder and satisfies certain other requirements, or otherwise establishes an exemption. Generally, information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to a payment of disposition proceeds to a Non-U.S. Holder where the transaction is effected outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a broker. However, for information reporting purposes, dispositions effected through a non-U.S. office of a broker with substantial U.S. ownership or operations generally will be treated in a manner similar to dispositions effected through a U.S. office of a broker. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules to them. Copies of information returns may be made available to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is incorporated under the provisions of a specific treaty or agreement. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a Non-U.S. Holder can be refunded or credited against the Non-U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that an appropriate claim is timely filed with the IRS. Federal Estate Tax Common stock held by an individual Non-U.S. Holder at the time of death and common stock held by entities the property of which is potentially includible in such an individuals gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes will be included in such Non-U.S. Holders gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise. Under current law, no estate tax is imposed on amounts included in the taxable estate of decedents dying in calendar year 2010. Generally, amounts included in the taxable estate of decedents after December 31, 2010 will be subject to U.S. federal estate tax at a maximum rate of 55%. Congress may pass legislation amending the U.S. federal estate tax rates, or other aspects of the U.S. federal estate tax, and any such changes may apply retroactively. 121 Table of Contents UNDERWRITING The company, the selling stockholders and the underwriters named below have entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to the shares being offered. Subject to certain conditions, each underwriter has severally agreed to purchase the number of shares indicated in the following table. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated are the representatives of the underwriters. Underwriters Number of Shares Goldman, Sachs & Co. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. Total The underwriters are committed to take and pay for all of the shares being offered, if any are taken, other than the shares covered by the option described below unless and until this option is exercised. If the underwriters sell more shares than the total number set forth in the table above, the underwriters have an option to buy up to an additional shares. They may exercise that option for 30 days. If any shares are purchased pursuant to this option, the underwriters will severally purchase shares in approximately the same proportion as set forth in the table above. The following tables show the per share and total underwriting discounts and commissions to be paid to the underwriters by the company and the selling stockholders. Such amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares. Paid by the Company No Exercise Full Exercise Per Share $ $ Total $ $ Paid by the Selling Stockholders No Exercise Full Exercise Per Share $ $ Total $ $ Shares sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the initial public offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectus. Any shares sold by the underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount of up to $ per share from the initial public offering price. If all the shares are not sold at the initial public offering price, the representatives may change the offering price and the other selling terms. The offering of the shares by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters right to reject any order in whole or in part. The company and its officers, directors, employees and certain stockholders, including the selling stockholders, have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock during the period from the date of this prospectus continuing through the date 180 days after the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of the representatives. This agreement does not 122 Table of Contents apply to any existing employee benefit plans. See Shares Available for Future Sale for a discussion of certain transfer restrictions. The 180-day restricted period described in the preceding paragraph will be automatically extended if: (1) during the last 17 days of the 180-day restricted period the company issues an earnings release or announces material news or a material event; or (2) prior to the expiration of the 180-day restricted period, the company announces that it will release earnings results during the 15-day period following the last day of the 180-day period, in which case the restrictions described in the preceding paragraph will continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release of the announcement of the material news or material event. Prior to the offering, there has been no public market for the shares. The initial public offering price has been negotiated among the company and the representatives. Among the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price of the shares, in addition to prevailing market conditions, will be the companys historical performance, estimates of the business potential and earnings prospects of the company, an assessment of the companys management and the consideration of the above factors in relation to market valuation of companies in related businesses. An application has been made to list the common stock on the under the symbol LPLA. In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares of common stock in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering. Covered short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters option to purchase additional shares from the company in the offering. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase additional shares pursuant to the option granted to them. Naked short sales are any sales in excess of such option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of common stock made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering. The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions. Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions, as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the companys stock, and together with the imposition of the penalty bid, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the common stock.

F-6 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 1. Organization and Description of the Company LPL Investment Holdings Inc. (LPLIH), a Delaware holding corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) provides an integrated platform of proprietary technology, brokerage and investment advisory services to independent financial advisors and financial advisors at financial institutions (collectively advisors) in the United States. Through its proprietary technology, custody and clearing platforms, the Company provides access to diversified financial products and services enabling its advisors to offer independent financial advice and brokerage services to retail investors (their clients). 2. Basis of Presentation Quarterly Reporting  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The Companys results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year or any other interim period. Certain reclassifications were made to previously reported amounts in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto to make them consistent with the current period presentation. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all information and notes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). Accordingly, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes for the year ended December 31, 2009, contained in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. The Company has evaluated subsequent events up to and including the date these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. Consolidation  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LPLIH and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments in which the Company exercises significant influence but does not exercise control and is not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. Use of Estimates  The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates estimates, including those related to revenue and related expense recognition, asset impairment, valuation of accounts receivable, contingencies and litigation, and valuation and recognition of share-based payments. These accounting policies are stated in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009, contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and the differences may be material to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Reportable Segment  The Companys internal reporting is organized into three service channels; Independent Advisor Services, Institution Services and Custom Clearing Services, which are designed to enhance the services provided to its advisors and financial institutions. These service channels qualify as individual operating segments, but are aggregated and viewed as one single F-7 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  (Continued) reportable segment due to their similar economic characteristics, products and services, production and distribution process, regulatory environment and quantitative thresholds. Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Companys financial assets and liabilities are carried at fair value or at amounts that, because of their short-term nature, approximate current fair value, with the exception of its indebtedness. The Company carries borrowings on its senior secured credit facilities and unsecured subordinated notes at amortized cost. As of March 31, 2010, the carrying amount and fair value of these borrowings were approximately $1,367 million and $1,316 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, the carrying amount and fair value was approximately $1,369 million and $1,278 million, respectively. See Note 4 for additional detail regarding the Companys fair value measurements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  Recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the three months ended March 31, 2010, as compared to the recent accounting pronouncements described in the Companys 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, that are of significance, or potential significance, to the Company are discussed below. In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820)  Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements (ASU 2010-6). ASU 2010-6 requires new disclosures regarding significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements relating to Level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU also clarifies existing disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques for Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2010-6 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosure of activity within Level 3 fair value measurements, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those years. The adoption of ASU 2010-6 did not have a material impact on the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 3. Restructuring Strategic Business Review Initiative On December 29, 2008, the Company committed to and implemented an organizational restructuring plan intended to reduce its cost structure and improve operating efficiencies, which resulted in a reduction in its overall workforce of approximately 250 employees. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 420, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities , the Company has recorded severance and one-time involuntary termination benefit accruals in accounts payable and accrued liabilities within the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company completed this initiative and expects to pay all costs by April 2011. The following table summarizes the balance of accrued expenses related to the strategic business review and the changes in the accrued amounts as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2010 (in thousands): Accrued Balance Accrued Balance Cumulative at December 31, at March 31, Costs Incurred 2009 Payments 2010 to Date(1) Severance and benefits $ 1,996 $ (696 ) $ 1,300 $ 14,505 (1) At March 31, 2010, cumulative costs incurred to date represent the total expected costs. F-8 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  (Continued) Consolidation of Affiliated Entities Initiative On July 10, 2009, the Company committed to a corporate restructuring plan that consolidated the operations of Mutual Service Corporation (MSC), Associated Financial Group, Inc., Associated Securities Corp., Inc. (Associated), Associated Planners Investment Advisory, Inc. and Waterstone Financial Group, Inc. (WFG) (together, the Affiliated Entities) with LPL Financial Corporation (LPL Financial). This restructuring was effected to enhance service offerings to advisors while also generating efficiencies. The Company expects total costs associated with the initiative to be approximately $73.8 million. The Company has incurred the majority of these costs and anticipates recognizing the remaining costs by December 2013; however, adjustments may occur due to estimates of abandoned lease obligations with terms that extend through 2018. The Company paid charges related to the conversion and transfer of certain advisors associated with the Affiliated Entities and their client accounts. Following the completion of these transfer activities, the registered representatives and client accounts that transferred are associated with LPL Financial. In 2009, as a condition for the regulatory approval of the transfer, the Affiliated Entities were required to deposit $12.8 million into escrow accounts pending the resolution of certain matters, of which $7.3 million was released. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company was required to deposit an additional $2.5 million into the escrow accounts, of which $0.1 million has been released. The Company paid charges related to early termination costs associated with certain contracts held by the Affiliated Entities. Additionally, the Company recorded accruals for employee related costs, including severance and one-time involuntary termination benefits that will be recognized ratably over the employees remaining service period. The Company recognized charges related to the early termination and partial abandonment of certain lease arrangements offset by estimates for sub-lease efforts. The Company anticipates additional costs of approximately $1.9 million related to the abandonment of the remaining office space, which can not be fully estimated until the date of abandonment. The Company also recorded non-cash charges for the impairment of fixed assets associated with abandoned lease arrangements. The following table summarizes the balance of accrued expenses and the changes in the accrued amounts as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2010 (in thousands): Accrued Accrued Cumulative Total Balance at Balance at Costs Expected December 31, Costs March 31, Incurred Restructuring 2009 Incurred Payments Non-cash 2010 to Date Costs Severance and benefits $ 2,759 $ 1,774 $ (2,412 ) $ (456 ) $ 1,665 $ 11,210 $ 11,525 Lease and contract termination fees 7,458 485 (1,519 ) 80 6,504 16,404 18,455 Asset impairments  195  (195 )  20,119 20,177 Conversion and transfer costs 304 1,495 (397 ) (1,128 ) 274 15,378 23,599 Total $ 10,521 $ 3,949 $ (4,328 ) $ (1,699 ) $ 8,443 $ 63,111 $ 73,756 4. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized within a three-level fair value hierarchy. This hierarchy requires F-9 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  (Continued) entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:  Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2  Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.  Level 3  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. The Companys fair value measurements are evaluated within the fair value hierarchy, based on the nature of inputs used to determine the fair value at the measurement date. At March 31, 2010, the Company had the following financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: Cash Equivalents  The Companys cash equivalents include money market funds, which are short term in nature with readily determinable values derived from active markets. Securities Segregated Under Federal and Other Regulations  The Companys segregated accounts contain U.S. treasury securities that are short term in nature with readily determinable values derived from quoted prices in active markets. Securities Owned and Securities Sold But Not Yet Purchased  The Companys trading securities consist of house account model portfolios for the purpose of benchmarking the performance of its fee based advisory platforms and temporary positions resulting from the processing of client transactions. Examples of these securities include money market funds, U.S. treasuries, mutual funds, certificates of deposit, traded equity securities and debt securities. The Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of its trading securities. Prices received from the pricing services are validated using various methods including comparison to prices received from additional pricing services, comparison to available quoted market prices and review of other relevant market data including implied yields of major categories of securities. In general, these quoted prices are derived from active markets for identical assets or liabilities. When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities are not available, the quoted prices are based on similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. For certificates of deposit and treasury securities, the Company utilizes market-based inputs including observable market interest rates that correspond to the remaining maturities or the next interest reset dates. At March 31, 2010, the Company did not adjust prices received from the independent third-party pricing services. Other Assets  The Companys other assets include deferred compensation plan assets that are invested in money market funds and mutual funds which are actively traded and valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. Interest Rate Swaps  The Companys interest rate swaps are not traded on a market exchange; therefore, the fair values are determined using externally developed valuation models which include assumptions about the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) yield curve at interim reporting dates as well as counterparty credit risk and the Companys own non-performance risk. F-10 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  (Continued) There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between fair value measurement classifications during the three months ended March 31, 2010.

Held-to-Maturity Securities The Company holds certain investments in securities including U.S. government notes. The Company has both the intent and the ability to hold these investments to maturity and classifies them as such. Interest income is accrued as earned. Premiums and discounts are amortized using a method that approximates the effective yield method over the term of the security and are recorded as an adjustment to the investment yield.

Amortization expense for each of the fiscal years ended December 2010 (remainder) through 2014 and thereafter is estimated as follows (in thousands): 2010  remainder $ 27,746 2011 36,840 2012 36,548 2013 35,927 2014 35,927 Thereafter 375,016 Total $ 548,004 7. Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate differs from the federal corporate tax rate of 35%, primarily as a result of state taxes, settlement contingencies and expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes. These items resulted in effective tax rates of 42.9% and 44.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. 8. Indebtedness Senior Secured Credit Facilities  Borrowings under the Companys senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a base rate equal to either one, two, three, six, nine or twelve-month LIBOR plus the applicable margin, or an alternative base rate (ABR) plus the applicable margin. The ABR is equal to the greater of the prime rate or the effective federal funds rate plus 1 / 2 of 1.00%. The applicable margin on the senior secured term credit facilities could change depending on the Companys credit rating. The senior secured credit facilities are subject to certain financial and nonfinancial covenants. As of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under its senior secured credit facilities at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to LIBOR loans. Senior Unsecured Subordinated Notes  The Company has $550.0 million of senior unsecured subordinated notes due December 15, 2015. The notes bear interest at 10.75% per annum and interest payments are payable semiannually in arrears. The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking-fund payments with respect to the notes. The indenture underlying the senior unsecured subordinated notes contains various restrictions with respect to the issuer, including one or more restrictions relating to limitations on liens, sale and leaseback arrangements and funded debt of subsidiaries. The Company may voluntarily repurchase its senior unsecured subordinated notes at any time, pursuant to certain prepayment penalties. Revolving Line of Credit  On January 25, 2010, the Company amended its senior secured credit facilities to increase the revolving credit facility from $100.0 million to $218.2 million, $10.0 million of which is being used to support the issuance of an irrevocable letter of credit for its subsidiary, The Private Trust Company, N.A. (PTC). As a result of the amendment, the Company paid $2.8 million in debt issuance costs, which have been capitalized in other assets within the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of financial condition and are being amortized as additional interest expense over the expected term of the related debt agreement. The Company also F-14 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  (Continued) extended the maturity of a $163.5 million tranche of the revolving facility to June 28, 2013, while the remaining $54.7 million tranche retains its original maturity date of December 28, 2011. The tranche maturing in 2013 is priced at LIBOR + 3.50% with a commitment fee of 0.75%. The tranche maturing in 2011 maintains its previous pricing of LIBOR + 2.00% with a commitment fee of 0.375%. There was no outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Bank Loans Payable  The Company maintains two uncommitted lines of credit. One line has an unspecified limit, and is primarily dependent on the Companys ability to provide sufficient collateral. The other line has a $100.0 million limit and allows for both collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings. At March 31, 2010 there was a $40.0 million outstanding balance on the unsecured portion of one of the uncommitted lines of credit. The line was subsequently paid down in full on April 1, 2010. Both lines were utilized in 2009, however there were no balances outstanding at December 31, 2009. The Companys outstanding borrowings were as follows (in thousands): March 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Interest Interest Maturity Balance Rate Balance Rate Bank loans payable  unsecured 7/31/2010 $ 40,000 1.00 % $  Senior secured term loan: Unhedged 6/28/2013 417,117 2.04 %(1) 419,223 2.00 %(3) Hedged with interest rate swaps 6/28/2013 400,000 2.04 %(2) 400,000 2.00 %(4) Senior unsecured subordinated notes 12/15/2015 550,000 10.75 % 550,000 10.75 % Total borrowings 1,407,117 1,369,223 Less current borrowings (maturities within 12 months) 48,424 8,424 Long-term borrowings  net of current portion $ 1,358,693 $ 1,360,799 (1) As of March 31, 2010, the variable interest rate for the unhedged portion of the senior secured term loan is based on the three-month LIBOR of 0.29%, plus the applicable interest rate margin of 1.75%.

Interest Rate Swaps An interest rate swap is a financial derivative instrument whereby two parties enter into a contractual agreement to exchange payments based on underlying interest rates. The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability on its floating rate senior secured term loan. The Company is required to pay the counterparty to the agreement fixed interest payments on a notional balance and in turn, receives variable interest payments on that notional balance. Payments are settled quarterly on a net basis. The following table summarizes information related to the Companys interest rate swaps as of March 31, 2010 (in thousands): Variable Notional Fixed Receive Fair Maturity Balance Pay Rate Rate(1) Value Date $ 70,000 3.43 % 0.29 % $ (550 ) June 30, 2010 120,000 4.79 % 0.29 % (1,352 ) June 30, 2010 145,000 4.83 % 0.29 % (7,384 ) June 30, 2011 65,000 4.85 % 0.29 % (4,964 ) June 30, 2012 $ 400,000 $ (14,250 ) (1) The variable receive rate reset on the last day of the period, based on the applicable three-month LIBOR. The effective rate from December 31, 2009 through March 30, 2010 was 0.25%. As of March 31, 2010, the effective rate was 0.29%. The interest rate swap agreements qualify for hedge accounting and have been designated as cash flow hedges against specific payments due on the Companys senior secured term loan. As of F-16 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  (Continued) March 31, 2010, the Company assessed the interest rate swap agreements as being highly effective and expects them to continue to be highly effective. Accordingly, the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps have been recorded as other comprehensive loss, with the fair value included as a liability on the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company has reclassified $4.3 million and $3.9 million from other comprehensive loss as additional interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Based on current interest rate assumptions and assuming no additional interest rate swap agreements are entered into, the Company expects to reclassify $17.2 million or $9.8 million after tax, from other comprehensive loss as additional interest expense over the next 12 months. 10. Commitments and Contingencies Leases  The Company leases certain office space and equipment at its headquarter locations under various operating leases. These leases are generally subject to scheduled base rent and maintenance cost increases, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the leases. Service Contracts  The Company is party to certain long-term contracts for systems and services that enable back office trade processing and clearing for its product and service offerings. One agreement, for clearing services, contains no minimum annual purchase commitment, but the agreement provides for certain penalties should the Company fail to maintain a certain threshold of client accounts. Future minimum payments under leases, lease commitments and other non-cancellable contractual obligations with remaining terms greater than one year as of March 31, 2010 are as follows (in thousands): Years ending December 31 2010  remainder $ 22,152 2011 30,144 2012 23,469 2013 15,410 2014 8,765 Thereafter 15,065 Total(1) $ 115,005 (1) Minimum payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rental income of $0.5 million due in the future under noncancellable subleases. Total rental expense for all operating leases was approximately $4.4 million and $5.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Guarantees  The Company occasionally enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require it to indemnify certain parties against third-party claims. The terms of these obligations vary and, because a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated, the Company has determined that it is not possible to make an estimate of the amount that it could be obligated to pay under such contracts. The Companys subsidiaries provide guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under their standard membership agreements, which require a member to guarantee the performance of other members. Under these agreements, if a member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, all other members would be required to meet any shortfall. The Companys liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the cash and F-17 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  (Continued) securities it has posted as collateral. However, the potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these agreements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these transactions. Loan Commitments  From time to time, the Company makes loans to its advisors, primarily to newly recruited advisors to assist in the transition process. Due to timing differences, the Company may make commitments to issue such loans prior to actually funding them. These commitments are generally contingent upon certain events occurring, including but not limited to the financial advisor joining the Company, and may be forgivable. The Company had no significant unfunded commitments at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Litigation  The Company has been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, the Company cannot predict with certainty what the eventual loss or range of loss related to such matters will be. The Company recognizes a legal liability when it believes it is probable a liability has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Defense costs are expensed as incurred and classified as professional services within the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. When there is indemnification or insurance, the Company may engage in defense of settlement and subsequently seek reimbursement for such matters. In connection with various acquisitions, and pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements, the Company has received third-party indemnification for certain legal proceedings and claims. These matters have been defended and paid directly by the indemnifying party. On October 1, 2009, LPL Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, received written notice from a third-party indemnitor under a certain purchase and sale agreement asserting that it is no longer obligated to indemnify the Company for certain claims under the provisions of the purchase and sale agreement. The Company believes that this assertion is without merit and has commenced litigation to enforce its indemnity rights. Additionally, the Company may settle certain legal claims before they are resolved with the indemnifying party. The Company believes, based on the information available at this time, after consultation with counsel, consideration of insurance, if any, and the indemnifications provided by the third-party indemnitors, notwithstanding the assertions by an indemnifying party noted in the preceding paragraph, that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on unaudited condensed consolidated statements of financial condition, income or cash flows. Other Commitments  As of March 31, 2010, the Company had received collateral primarily in connection with client margin loans with a market value of approximately $311.6 million, which it can sell or repledge. Of this amount, approximately $157.7 million has been pledged or sold as of March 31, 2010; $136.5 million was pledged to banks in connection with unutilized secured margin lines of credit, $12.8 million was pledged with client-owned securities to the Options Clearing Corporation, and $8.4 million was loaned to the Depository Trust Company (DTC) through participation in its Stock Borrow Program. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had received collateral primarily in connection with client margin loans with a market value of approximately $227.9 million, which it can sell or repledge. Of this amount, approximately $158.8 million has been pledged or sold as of December 31, 2009; $141.6 million was pledged to banks in connection with unutilized secured margin lines of credit, $10.0 million was pledged with client-owned securities to the Options Clearing Corporation, and $7.2 million was loaned to the DTC through participation in its Stock Borrow Program. F-18 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  (Continued) In August of 2007, pursuant to agreements with a large global insurance company, LPL Financial began providing brokerage, clearing and custody services on a fully disclosed basis; offering its investment advisory programs and platforms; and providing technology and additional processing and related services to its advisors and their clients. The terms of the agreements are five years, subject to additional 24-month extensions. Termination fees may be payable by a terminating or breaching party depending on the specific cause of termination. 11. Share-Based Compensation Certain employees, advisors, officers and directors who contribute to the success of the Company participate in various stock option plans. In addition, certain financial institutions participate in a warrant plan. Stock options and warrants generally vest in equal increments over a three- to five-year period and expire on the 10th anniversary following the date of grant. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense related to employee stock option awards based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period of the award, which generally equals the vesting period. The Company recognized $2.5 million and $1.2 million of share-based compensation related to the vesting of employee stock option awards during the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of March 31, 2010, total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted was $29.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.77 years. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense for stock options and warrants awarded to its advisors and financial institutions based on the fair value of awards at each interim reporting period. The Company recognized $0.6 million and $0.2 million of share based compensation during the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to the vesting of stock options and warrants awarded to its advisors and financial institutions. As of March 31, 2010, total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted was $12.2 million for advisors and financial institutions, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 4.11 years. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used by the Company in calculating the fair value of its stock options and warrants with the Black-Scholes valuation model that have been granted during the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009: 2010 2009 Expected life (in years) 6.51 8.81 Expected stock price volatility 50.32 % 48.67 % Expected dividend yield   Annualized forfeiture rate 4.99 % 3.00 % Fair value of options $ 12.34 $ 10.40 Risk-free interest rate 2.79 % 2.45 % The risk-free interest rates are based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of the grant with remaining terms equivalent to the respective expected terms of the options. The dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that the Company has no present intention to pay cash dividends. The Company estimates the expected term for its employee option awards using the simplified method in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 110, Certain Assumptions Used in Valuation Methods , because the Company does not have sufficient relevant historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns. The Company estimates the expected term for stock options and warrants awarded to advisors and financial institutions using the contractual term. Expected volatility is calculated based on companies F-19 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  (Continued) of similar growth and maturity and the Companys peer group in the industry in which the Company does business because the Company does not have sufficient historical volatility data. The Company will continue to use peer group volatility information until historical volatility of the Company is available to measure expected volatility for future grants. In the future, as the Company gains historical data for volatility of its own stock and the actual term over which stock options and warrants are held expected volatility and the expected term may change, which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and warrants and, ultimately, compensation recorded on future grants. The Company has assumed an annualized forfeiture rate for its stock options and warrants based on a combined review of industry and employee turnover data, as well as an analytical review performed of historical pre-vesting forfeitures occurring over the previous year. The Company records additional expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated and records a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeiture is higher than estimated. The following table summarizes the Companys activity in its stock option and warrant plans for the three months ended March 31, 2010: Weighted-Average Remaining Aggregate Number of Weighted-Average Contractual Intrinsic Shares Exercise Price Term (Years) Value (In thousands) Outstanding  December 31, 2009 22,702,469 $ 6.99 Granted 68,776 23.41 Exercised (397 ) 22.82 Forfeited (60,058 ) 23.30 Outstanding  March 31, 2010 22,710,790 $ 7.00 4.76 $ 472,708 Exercisable  March 31, 2010 18,221,524 $ 3.05 3.74 $ 451,193 The following table summarizes information about outstanding stock option and warrant awards: Outstanding Exercisable Weighted- Weighted- Weighted- Total Average Average Average Number of Remaining Exercise Number of Exercise Range of Exercise Prices Shares Life (Years) Price Shares Price At March 31, 2010: $1.07  $2.38 17,185,660 3.50 $ 1.74 17,185,660 $ 1.74 $10.30  $19.74 948,799 8.65 18.30 198,876 16.74 $21.60  $22.08 2,209,650 9.18 22.02 124,499 21.60 $23.02  $27.80 2,366,681 8.24 26.58 712,489 27.49 22,710,790 4.76 $ 7.00 18,221,524 $ 3.05 2008 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan On November 19, 2008, the Company established an unfunded, unsecured deferred compensation plan to permit employees and former employees that hold non-qualified stock options issued under the 2005 Stock Option Plan for Incentive Stock Options and 2005 Stock Option Plan for Non-qualified Stock Options that were to expire in 2009 and 2010, to receive stock units under the F-20 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  (Continued) 2008 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Stock units represent the right to receive one share of common stock. Distribution will occur at the earliest of (a) a date in 2012 to be determined by the Board of Directors; (b) a change in control of the Company; or (c) death or disability of the participant. Issuance of stock options for stock units, which occurred in December 2008, is not taxable for federal and state income tax purposes until the participant receives a distribution under the deferred compensation plan. At March 31, 2010, the Company had 2,823,452 stock units outstanding under the 2008 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. 2000 Stock Bonus Plan The Companys advisors participate in the fifth amended and restated 2000 Stock Bonus Plan (the Stock Bonus Plan), which provided for the grant and allocation of bonus credits. Each bonus credit represented the right to receive shares of common stock. Participation in the Stock Bonus Plan was dependent upon meeting certain eligibility criteria, and bonus credits were allocated to eligible participants based on certain performance metrics, including amount and type of commissions, as well as tenure. Bonus credits vested annually in equal increments over a three-year period and expired on the tenth anniversary following the date of grant. Unvested bonus credits held by advisors who terminated prior to vesting were forfeited and reallocated to other advisors eligible under the plan. In 2008, the Company amended and restated its Stock Bonus Plan to provide its advisors with physical ownership of common stock of the Company. Consequently, on December 28, 2008, the Company issued 7,423,973 restricted shares. These restricted shares are entitled to vote but may not be sold, assigned or transferred and are not entitled to receive dividends or non-cash distributions, until either a sale of the Company that constitutes a change in control or an initial public offering. The Company accounts for restricted shares granted to its advisors by measuring such grants at their then-current lowest aggregate value. Since the value is contingent upon the Companys decision to sell itself or issue its common stock to the public through a registered initial public offering, the current aggregate value will be zero until such event occurs. Upon the occurrence of such an event, the Company will record the par value, additional paid in capital and expense based on the number of restricted shares under the stock bonus plan multiplied by the fair market value determined at the event date. Director Restricted Stock Plan In March 2010, the Company established a Director Restricted Stock Plan (the Director Plan). Eligible participants include non-employee directors who are in a position to make a significant contribution to the success of the Company. Restricted stock awards vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant and upon termination of service, unvested awards shall immediately be forfeited. On March 15, 2010, the Company issued 6,408 restricted stock awards to certain of its directors at a fair value of $23.41 per share. A summary of the status of the Companys restricted stock awards under the Director Plan as of and for the three months ending March 31, 2010 is as follows: Weighted Average Number of Grant-Date Shares Fair Value Nonvested at January 1, 2010  $  Granted 6,408 23.41 Vested   Forfeited   Nonvested at March 31, 2010 6,408 $ 23.41 F-21 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  (Continued) The Company accounts for restricted stock awards granted to its non-employee directors by measuring such awards at their grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period, which generally equals the vesting period. As of March 31, 2010, total unrecognized compensation cost was $0.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of 1.96 years. 12. Earnings per Share In calculating earnings per share using the two-class method, the Company is required to allocate a portion of its earnings to employees that hold stock units that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents under its 2008 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income less earnings attributable to employees that hold stock units under the 2008 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan by the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed in a manner similar to basic earnings per share, except the weighted average number of shares outstanding is increased to include the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, warrants and other stock-based awards. A reconciliation of the income used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods noted was as follows: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 2009 (In thousands) Basic earnings per share: Net income, as reported $ 25,554 $ 14,797 Less: allocation of undistributed earnings to stock units (414 ) (380 ) Net income, for computing basic earnings per share $ 25,140 $ 14,417 Diluted earnings per share: Net income, as reported $ 25,554 $ 14,797 Less: allocation of undistributed earnings to stock units (364 ) (337 ) Net income, for computing diluted earnings per share $ 25,190 $ 14,460 A reconciliation of the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods noted was as follows: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 2009 (In thousands) Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding 86,800 86,542 Dilutive common share equivalents 12,145 11,417 Diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding 98,945 97,959 F-22 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC.

Related Party Transactions Alix Partners, LLP (Alix Partners), a company majority-owned by one of the Companys majority stockholders, provides LPL Financial services pursuant to an agreement for interim management and consulting. The Company paid $0.6 million to AlixPartners during the three months ended March 31, 2009. One of the Companys majority stockholders owns a minority interest in Artisan Partners Limited Partnership (Artisan), which pays fees in exchange for product distribution and record-keeping services. During the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company earned $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in fees from Artisan. Additionally, as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, Artisan owed the Company $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, which is included in receivables from product sponsors, broker-dealers and clearing organizations on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. American Beacon Advisor, Inc. (Beacon), a company majority-owned by one of the Companys majority stockholders, pays fees in exchange for product distribution and record-keeping services.

(Blue Frog), a privately held technology company in which the Company holds an equity interest, provides software licensing for annuity order entry and compliance. The Company paid $0.7 million and $0.5 million to Blue Frog for such services during the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In conjunction with the acquisition of UVEST Financial Services Group, Inc. (UVEST), the Company made full-recourse loans to certain members of management (also selling stockholders), most of whom are now stockholders of the Company. In February 2010, the Company forgave approximately $0.4 million to a stockholder. As of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, outstanding stockholder loans, which are reported as a deduction from stockholders equity, were approximately $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively. F-23 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  (Continued) 14. Net Capital/Regulatory Requirements The Companys registered broker-dealers are subject to the SECs Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined. Net capital is calculated for each broker-dealer subsidiary individually. Excess net capital of one broker-dealer subsidiary may not be used to offset a net capital deficiency of another broker-dealer subsidiary. Net capital and the related net capital requirement may fluctuate on a daily basis. Net capital and net capital requirements for the Companys broker-dealer subsidiaries as of March 31, 2010 are presented in the following table (in thousands): Minimum Net Excess Net Net Capital Capital Required Capital LPL Financial Corporation $ 102,639 $ 6,646 $ 95,993 UVEST Financial Services Group, Inc. 10,874 1,656 9,218 Total $ 113,513 $ 8,302 $ 105,211 In connection with the consolidation of the Affiliated Entities; Associated, MSC and WFG have ceased operations but continue to be required to meet certain regulatory requirements until such time that their broker-dealer license withdrawals are complete. At March 31, 2010, Associated, MSC and WFG had net capital of $3.0 million, $14.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, which was $2.8 million, $14.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, in excess of their minimum net capital requirements. LPL Financial is a clearing broker-dealer and UVEST is an introducing broker-dealer. Prior to the cessation of operations, Associated, MSC and WFG were introducing broker-dealers. PTC is also subject to various regulatory capital requirements. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. As of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the Company and PTC have met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. The Company operates in a highly regulated industry. Applicable laws and regulations restrict permissible activities and investments. These policies require compliance with various financial and financial advisor related regulations. The consequences of noncompliance can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions. In addition, the Company is also subject to comprehensive examinations and supervision by various governmental and self-regulatory agencies. These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to prescribe greater limitations on the operations of a regulated entity for the protection of investors or public interest. Furthermore, where the agencies determine that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law, or are otherwise inconsistent with the laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies, greater restrictions may be imposed. 15. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk LPL Financials client securities activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis. In margin transactions, LPL Financial extends credit to the client, subject to various regulatory and internal margin requirements, collateralized by cash and securities in the clients account. As clients write options contracts or sell securities short, LPL Financial may incur losses if the clients do not F-24 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  (Continued) fulfill their obligations and the collateral in the clients accounts is not sufficient to fully cover losses that clients may incur from these strategies. To control this risk, LPL Financial monitors margin levels daily and clients are required to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary. LPL Financial is obligated to settle transactions with brokers and other financial institutions even if its clients fail to meet their obligation to LPL Financial. Clients are required to complete their transactions on the settlement date, generally three business days after the trade date. If clients do not fulfill their contractual obligations, LPL Financial may incur losses. LPL Financial has established procedures to reduce this risk by generally requiring that clients deposit cash and/or securities into their account prior to placing an order. LPL Financial may at times maintain inventories in equity securities on both a long and short basis that are recorded on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of financial condition at market value. While long inventory positions represent LPL Financials ownership of securities, short inventory positions represent obligations of LPL Financial to deliver specified securities at a contracted price, which may differ from market prices prevailing at the time of completion of the transaction. Accordingly, both long and short inventory positions may result in losses or gains to LPL Financial as market values of securities fluctuate. To mitigate the risk of losses, long and short positions are marked-to-market daily and are continuously monitored by LPL Financial. UVEST is engaged in buying and selling securities and other financial instruments for clients of advisors and financial institutions. Such transactions are introduced and cleared through a third-party clearing firm on a fully disclosed basis. While introducing broker-dealers generally have less risk than clearing firms, their clearing agreements expose them to credit risk in the event that their clients dont fulfill contractual obligations with the clearing broker-dealer. The Affiliated Entities were engaged in buying and selling securities and other financial instruments for clients of advisors. Such transactions were introduced and cleared through a third-party clearing firm on a fully disclosed basis. These firms no longer conduct such activities. The registered representatives and their client accounts have either transitioned or are in the process of transitioning to LPL Financial or to new firms. 16. Subsequent Events On May 24, 2010, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement). The Amended Credit Agreement amends and restates the Companys Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 18, 2007. Pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company has established a new term loan tranche of $580.0 million maturing on June 28, 2017 (the 2017 Term Loans). The Company also extended the maturity of a $500.0 million tranche of its term loan facility to June 25, 2015 (the 2015 Term Loans), with the remaining $317.1 million tranche of the term loan facility maturing on the original maturity date of June 28, 2013 (the 2013 Term Loans). The applicable margin for borrowings with respect to the (a) 2013 Term Loans is currently 0.75% for base rate borrowings and 1.75% for LIBOR borrowings; (b) 2015 Term Loans is currently 1.75% for base rate borrowings and 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings, and (c) 2017 Term Loans is currently 2.75% for base rate borrowings and 3.75% for LIBOR borrowings. The applicable margin on the 2013 Term Loans could change depending on the Companys credit rating. The LIBOR Rate with respect to the 2015 Term Loans and the 2017 Term Loans shall in no event be less than 1.50%. On May 24, 2010, the Company gave notice of redemption of all of its outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the 2015 Notes), representing an aggregate principal amount of $550.0 million. The redemption price of the 2015 Notes is 105.375% of the outstanding aggregate F-25 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  (Continued) principal amount, or approximately $29.6 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to but not including June 22, 2010 (the Redemption Date). The Company anticipates that the 2015 Notes will be redeemed on the Redemption Date and accordingly, will record the charge as a debt extinguishment within its consolidated statements of income. None of the 2015 Notes will remain outstanding after the Redemption Date. The Company will use the proceeds from the new term loan tranche under its Amended Credit Agreement and additional cash on hand to finance the redemption. The Company anticipates that the aggregate cash payment for the redemption, including accrued and unpaid interest, will be approximately $610.4 million.

Through its proprietary technology, custody and clearing platforms, the Company provides access to diversified financial products and services enabling its advisors to offer independent financial advice and brokerage services to retail investors (their clients). On December 28, 2005, LPL Holdings, Inc. (LPLH), and its subsidiaries were acquired through a merger transaction with BD Acquisition Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of LPLIH (previously named BD Investment Holdings, Inc.). LPLIH was formed by investment funds affiliated with TPG Capital, and Hellman & Friedman LLC (collectively, the Majority Holders). The acquisition was accomplished through the merger of BD Acquisition, Inc. with and into LPLH, with LPLH being the surviving entity (the Acquisition). The Acquisition was financed by a combination of borrowings under the Companys senior credit facilities, the issuance of senior unsecured subordinated notes and direct and indirect equity investments from the Majority Holders, co-investors, management and the Companys advisors.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation  These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuation of certain financial instruments, intangible assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of stock compensation, accruals for liabilities, income taxes, revenue and expense accruals, and other matters that affect the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions and the differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. Certain reclassifications were made to previously reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto to make them consistent with the current period presentation. The Company has evaluated subsequent events up to and including the date these consolidated financial statements were issued. Consolidation  These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LPLIH and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments in which the Company exercises significant influence but does not exercise control and is not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. Revenue Recognition Policies Commission  The Company records commissions received from mutual funds, annuity, insurance, equity, fixed income, direct investment, option and commodity transactions on a trade-date basis. Commissions also include mutual fund and variable annuity trails, which are recognized as earned. Due to the significant volume of mutual fund and variable annuity purchases and sales transacted by advisors directly with product manufacturers, management estimates its trail revenues and upfront commission for each accounting period for which the proceeds have not yet been received. These estimates are based on a number of factors, primarily on market levels and the volume of similar transactions in prior periods. The Company also records commissions payable based upon standard payout ratios for each product as it accrues for commission revenue. Advisory and Asset-Based Fees  The Company charges investment advisory fees based on an advisors portfolio value, generally at the beginning of each quarter. Advisory fees collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue and are recognized ratably over the period in which such fees are earned. Advisory fees collected in arrears are recorded as earned. Asset-based fees are primarily derived from the Companys marketing, sub-transfer agency agreements, and cash sweep products and are recorded and recognized ratably over the period in which services are provided. F-34 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Transaction and Other Fees  The Company charges transaction fees for executing noncommissionable transactions on client accounts. Transaction related charges are recognized on a trade-date basis. Other fees relate to services provided and other account charges generally outlined in the Companys agreements with its clients, advisors and financial institutions. Such fees are recognized as services are performed or as earned, as applicable. In addition, the Company offers various software-related products, for which fees are charged on a subscription basis and are recognized over the subscription period. Interest Income, Net of Interest Expense  The Company earns interest income from its cash equivalents and client margin balances, less interest expense on related transactions. Because interest expense incurred in connection with cash equivalents and client margin balances is completely offset by revenue on related transactions, the Company considers such interest to be an operating expense. Gain on Sale of Mortgage Loans Held for Sale  The Company, through its mortgage affiliate Innovex, recognized gains on the sale of mortgage loans held for sale on the date of settlement. On December 31, 2007, Innovex ceased operations. Prior to that date, a gain was recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the related mortgage loans sold, including deferred loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs. All loans were sold on a servicing-released basis (i.e. the Company did not service the loans after they were sold, and all loans were sold before the first payment was made). Loans were accounted for as sold when control of the mortgage loans was surrendered. Control over mortgage loans was deemed to be surrendered when (i) the mortgage loans were isolated from the Company, (ii) the buyer had the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the loans, and (iii) the Company did not maintain effective control of the mortgage loans through either (a) an agreement that entitled and obligated the Company to repurchase or redeem the mortgage loans before maturity or (b) the ability to unilaterally cause the buyer to return specific mortgage loans. Compensation and Benefits  The Company records compensation and benefits for all cash and deferred compensation, benefits and related taxes as earned by its employees. Compensation and benefits expense also includes fees earned by temporary employees and contractors who perform similar services to those performed by the Companys employees, primarily software development and project management activities. Temporary employee and contractor services of $18.0 million, $36.9 million, and $25.4 million were incurred during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Share-Based Compensation  The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense related to employee stock option awards in net income based on the grant-date fair value over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which generally equals the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock options and warrants awarded to its advisors and financial institutions based on the fair value of the award at each interim reporting period. Stock Split  The Company affected a ten-for-one stock split as of January 1, 2008. All per share amounts, average shares and options outstanding, and shares and options outstanding have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the stock split. Income Taxes  In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates income tax expense based on various jurisdictions where it conducts business. The Company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is established to the extent that it is more-likely-than-not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized. When the Company establishes a valuation allowance or modifies the existing allowance in a certain reporting period, the Company generally records a corresponding increase or decrease to tax F-35 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) expense in the consolidated statements of income. Management makes significant judgments in determining the provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowances recorded against the deferred tax asset. Changes in the estimate of these taxes occur periodically due to changes in the tax rates, changes in the business operations, implementation of tax planning strategies, resolution with taxing authorities of issues where the Company had previously taken certain tax positions and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. These changes could have a material affect on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition, income or cash flows in the period or periods in which they occur. The Company recognizes the tax effects of a position in the financial statements only if it is more-likely-than-not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits, otherwise no benefits of the position are to be recognized. The more-likely-than-not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit. Moreover, each tax position meeting the recognition threshold is required to be measured as the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. See Note 11 for additional detail regarding the Companys uncertain tax positions. Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents are composed of interest and noninterest-bearing deposits, money market funds and U.S. government obligations that meet the definition of a cash equivalent. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments, with original maturities of less than 90 days that are not required to be segregated under federal or other regulations. Cash and Securities Segregated Under Federal and Other Regulations  Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to requirements related to maintaining cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of its customers in accordance with SEC Rule 15c3-3 and other regulations. Receivables From and Payables to Clients  Receivables from and payables to clients includes amounts due on cash and margin transactions. The Company extends credit to its clients to finance their purchases of securities on margin. The Company receives income from interest charged on such extensions of credit. The Company pays interest on certain client free credit balances held pending investment. Loans to clients are generally fully collateralized by client securities, which are not included in the consolidated statements of financial condition. To the extent that margin loans and other receivables from clients are not fully collateralized by client securities, management establishes an allowance that it believes is sufficient to cover any probable losses. When establishing this allowance, management considers a number of factors, including its ability to collect from the client and/or the clients advisor and the Companys historical experience in collecting on such transactions. The following schedule reflects the Companys activity in providing for an allowance for uncollectible amounts due from clients for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands): 2009 2008 Beginning balance  January 1 $ 972 $ 529 Provision  443 Recoveries (180 )  Ending balance  December 31 $ 792 $ 972 F-36 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Receivables From Product Sponsors, Broker-Dealers and Clearing Organizations  Receivables from product sponsors, broker-dealers and clearing organizations primarily consists of commission and transaction-related receivables. Receivables From Others  Receivables from others primarily consists of other accrued fees from product sponsors and advisors. The Company periodically extends credit to its advisors in the form of recruiting loans, commission advances, and other loans. The decisions to extend credit to advisors are generally based on either the advisors credit history, their ability to generate future commissions, or both. Management maintains an allowance for uncollectible amounts using an aging analysis that takes into account the advisors registration status and the specific type of receivable. The aging thresholds and specific percentages used represent managements best estimates of probable losses. Management monitors the adequacy of these estimates through periodic evaluations against actual trends experienced. The following schedule reflects the Companys activity in providing for an allowance for uncollectible amounts due from others for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands): 2009 2008 Beginning balance  January 1 $ 4,076 $ 5,266 Provision for bad debts(1) 3,319 3,028 Charge-offs  net of recoveries (1,236 ) (4,218 ) Ending balance  December 31 $ 6,159 $ 4,076 (1) For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company has classified $0.3 million of the provision for bad debt as restructuring charges with the consolidated statements of income (see Note 4). Classification and Valuation of Certain Investments  The classification of an investment determines its accounting treatment. The Company generally classifies its investments in debt and equity instruments (including mutual funds, annuities, corporate bonds, government bonds and municipal bonds) as trading securities, except for government notes held by PTCH, which are classified as held-to-maturity based on managements intent and ability to hold them to maturity. The Company has not classified any investments as available-for-sale. Investment classifications are subject to ongoing review and can change. Securities classified as trading are carried at fair value, while securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at cost or amortized cost. When possible, the fair value of securities is determined by obtaining quoted market prices. The Company also makes estimates about the fair value of investments and the timing for recognizing losses based on market conditions and other factors. If its estimates change, the Company may recognize additional losses. Both unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities are recognized in other revenue on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income. Securities Owned and Sold But Not Yet Purchased  Securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased are reflected on a trade-date basis at market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses being recorded in other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Clients securities transactions are recorded on a settlement-date basis, with related commission income and expense reported on a trade-date basis. U.S. government notes are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity, as the Company has both the intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Interest income is accrued as earned. Premiums and discounts are amortized, using a method that approximates the effective yield method, over the term of the security and recorded as an adjustment to the investment yield. F-37 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Interest income is accrued as earned and dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Securities Borrowed and Loaned  Securities borrowed and securities loaned are accounted for as collateralized financings and are recorded at the amount of the cash provided for securities borrowed transactions and cash received for securities loaned (generally in excess of market values). The adequacy of the collateral deposited for securities borrowed is continuously monitored and adjusted when considered necessary to minimize the risk associated with this activity. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had $5.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in securities borrowed. The collateral received for securities loaned is generally cash and is adjusted daily through the Depository Trust Companys (DTC) net settlement process, and securities loaned is included in payable to broker-dealers and clearing organizations in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Securities loaned generally represent client securities that can be pledged under standard margin loan agreements. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had $7.2 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of pledged securities loaned under the DTC Stock Borrow Program. Fixed Assets  Furniture, equipment, computers, purchased software, capitalized software and leasehold improvements are recorded at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Furniture, equipment, computers and purchased software are depreciated over a period of three to seven years. Automobiles have depreciable lives of five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their useful lives or the terms of the underlying leases. Management reviews fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Software Development Costs  Software development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Software development costs include costs incurred in the development and enhancement of software used in connection with services provided by the Company that do not otherwise qualify for capitalization. The costs of internally developed software that qualify for capitalization are capitalized as fixed assets and subsequently amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally three years. The costs of internally developed software are included in fixed assets at the point at which the conceptual formulation, design and testing of possible software project alternatives are complete and management authorizes and commits to funding the project. The Company does not capitalize pilot projects and projects where it believes that the future economic benefits are less than probable. Reportable Segment  The Companys internal reporting is organized into three service channels; Independent Advisor Services, Institution Services and Custom Clearing Services, which are designed to enhance the services provided to its advisors and financial institutions. These service channels qualify as individual operating segments, but are aggregated and viewed as one single reportable segment due to their similar economic characteristics, products and services, production and distribution process, regulatory environment and quantitative thresholds. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Trademarks and Trade Names  The Company classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and (3) goodwill. The Company determines the useful lives of identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors considered when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement, the history of the asset, the Companys long-term strategy for the use of the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life F-38 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) of the asset, and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized, on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 5  20 years. See Note 10 for further discussion. When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of future cash flows. The Company recognizes an impairment loss if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. The Company uses a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions the Company believes hypothetical marketplace participants would use. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a $17.5 million charge for the impairment of advisor and financial institution relationship intangible assets. See Notes 4 and 10 for further discussion. No impairment occurred for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. The Company tests intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks trade names and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. The Company performs these annual impairment reviews as of the first day of the fourth quarter (October 1). The Company uses a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, which are based on the assumptions the Company believes hypothetical marketplace participants would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a $1.1 million charge for the impairment of trademarks and trade names. See Notes 4 and 10 for further discussion. No impairment occurred for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. The Company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the reporting unit level, which represent its operating segments. There were no changes to the Companys reporting units in 2009. The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process, if necessary. The first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The Company typically uses discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those the Company believes hypothetical marketplace participants would use. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. No impairment occurred for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Deferred Loan Issuance and Amendment Costs  Debt issuance and amendment costs have been capitalized and are being amortized as additional interest expense over the expected terms of the related debt agreements. Equity Method Investment  The Companys equity method investment is accounted for under the equity method when it exerts significant influence and ownership does not exceed 50% of the common stock. The Company records the investment at cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition and adjusts the carrying amount of the investment to recognize its share of earnings or losses while recording such earnings or losses within the consolidated statements of income. F-39 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Mortgage Loans Held for Sale  Through its mortgage affiliate, Innovex, the Company originated residential mortgage loans through a warehouse line of credit facility or as a broker for other banks. The Company ceased the operations of Innovex on December 31, 2007. Prior to this date, mortgage loans held for sale were carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value and were sold on a nonrecourse basis with certain representations and warranties. Fair value was determined by outstanding commitments from investors. The Company evaluated the need for market valuation reserves on mortgage loans held for sale based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, primarily changes in interest rates and collateral values. The Company sold all mortgage loans that it originated. The Company had an agreement with certain third-party financial institutions for them to purchase loans originated by the Company, as long as such loans met certain criteria, generally within 30 days from funding. Loan origination and processing fees and certain direct origination costs were deferred until the related loan was sold. Drafts Payable  Drafts payable represent checks drawn against the Company that have not yet cleared through the bank. At December 31, 2009, the Company had amounts drawn of $111.1 million related to client activities, and $14.7 million of corporate overdrafts under a sweep agreement with a bank. Legal Reserves  The Company records reserves for legal proceedings in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the statement of financial condition. The determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management. Management considers many factors including, but not limited to, future legal expenses, the amount of the claim, the amount of the loss in the clients account, the basis and validity of the claim, the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of advisors and financial institutions, likely insurance coverage, previous results in similar cases, and legal precedents and case law. Each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management. Any change in the reserve amount is recorded as professional services in the consolidated statement of income. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to protect itself against changing interest rates and the related impact to the Companys cash flows. The Company also evaluates its contracts and commitments for terms that qualify as embedded derivatives. All derivatives are reported at their corresponding fair value in the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. Financial derivative instruments expected to be highly effective hedges against changes in cash flows are designated as such upon entering into the agreement. At each reporting date, the Company reassesses the effectiveness of the hedge to determine whether or not it can continue to use hedge accounting. Under hedge accounting, the Company records the increase or decrease in fair value of the derivative, net of tax impact, as other comprehensive income or loss. If the hedge is not determined to be a perfect hedge, yet is still considered highly effective, the Company will calculate the ineffective portion and record the related change in its fair value as additional interest income or expense in the consolidated statements of income. Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Companys financial assets and liabilities are carried at fair value or at amounts that, because of their short-term nature, approximate current fair value, with the exception of its indebtedness. The Company carries its indebtedness at amortized cost. As of December 31, 2009, the carrying amount and fair value of the Companys indebtedness was approximately $1,369 million and $1,278 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, the F-40 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) carrying amount and fair value was approximately $1,468 million and $1,057 million, respectively. See Note 6 for additional detail regarding the Companys fair value measurements. Commitments and Contingencies  The Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when analysis indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range of probable loss can be estimated, the Company accrues the most likely amount. Comprehensive Income (Loss)  The Companys comprehensive income (loss) is composed of net income and the effective portion of the unrealized gains (losses) on financial derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships, net of related tax effects. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  Recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the year ended December 31, 2009, that are of significance, or potential significance, to the Company are discussed below. In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance now codified as Accounting Standards Codification (the Codification or ASC) Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles , which established a single source of authoritative, non-governmental GAAP, except for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC, which are sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All other non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature that was not included in the Codification became non-authoritative. The Codification is effective for financial statements for interim or annual reporting periods ending after September 15, 2009. The Company adopted the new guidelines and numbering system prescribed by the Codification when referring to GAAP. As the Codification was not intended to change or alter existing GAAP, it did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued three staff positions intended to provide additional application guidance and enhance the disclosures regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities. This guidance is now codified within ASC Topic 820, Financial Measurements and Disclosures (ASC Topic 820), ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments (ASC Topic 825) and ASC Topic 320, Investments  Debt and Equity Securities (ASC Topic 320). ASC Topic 820 provides guidance on determining fair value when market activity has decreased. Updates contained within ASC Topic 825 enhance consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures. ASC Topic 320 provides additional guidance designed to create greater clarity and consistency in accounting for and presenting impairment losses on debt securities. Except for the addition of required disclosures, the adoption of the provisions contained in these topics did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events (ASC Topic 855), which established a general standard of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 855, which did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as ASC Topic 810, Consolidation (ASC Topic 810), which amends the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE) and requires ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. ASC Topic 810 significantly changes the consolidation rules for VIEs including the consolidation of common structures, such as joint ventures, equity method investments and collaboration arrangements. The guidance is applicable to all new and existing VIEs. The provisions of ASC Topic 810 are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after November 15, 2009. F-41 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) The Company adopted ASC Topic 810, which did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-05, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820)  Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value (ASU 2009-05). ASU 2009-05 provides clarification in measuring the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available and in circumstances in which a liability is restricted from being transferred. This ASU also clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are Level 1 fair value measurements. The Company adopted ASU 2009-05, which did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 3. Acquisitions Acquisition of UVEST On January 2, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of UVEST, augmenting the Companys position in providing services to banks, credit unions and other financial institutions. The purchase price totaled $89.5 million; $78.0 million in cash and the issuance of 603,660 shares of common stock at an estimated fair value of $18.90 per share. As part of the purchase price allocation, the Company recorded intangible assets for relationships with financial institutions and product sponsors. The value assigned to these relationships was $54.3 million, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of 20 years. Additionally, the Company assigned value to the trademark and trade name in the amount of $0.5 million. The trademark and trade name was determined to have an expected useful life of 18 months and therefore amortized over the same period. As of December 31, 2008, the trademark and trade name were fully amortized. Goodwill in the amount of $27.4 million was created for the excess purchase price over the value of assets and liabilities assumed. Immediately following the acquisition, the Company satisfied certain obligations under a phantom stock plan for UVEST employees by issuing 65,820 shares of common stock at an estimated fair value of $18.90 per share. Acquisition of the Affiliated Entities On June 20, 2007, the Company acquired the Affiliated Entities. This acquisition increased the number of advisors and strengthened the Companys position as a leading independent broker-dealer in the United States. The total purchase price was approximately $120.5 million; $63.3 million in cash and the issuance of 2,645,500 shares of common stock with an estimated fair value of $21.60 per share. As part of the purchase price allocation, the Company estimated the value of intangible assets for relationships with advisors and financial institutions and product sponsors to be $67.1 million, which was amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives ranging from 10 to 20 years. Additionally, the Company estimated the value of trademarks and trade names in the amount of $2.3 million. The trademarks and trade names were determined to have an expected useful life of three to five years and therefore amortized over the same period. Goodwill in the amount of $11.3 million was also recorded as part of the acquisition. Subsequent to the purchase, the Company settled an outstanding state tax audit. This settlement, which was favorable to the Company, resulted in a $0.1 million reduction to goodwill. F-42 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) On July 10, 2009, the Company committed to a corporate restructuring plan to consolidate the operations of the Affiliated Entities with LPL Financial. See Note 4 for further discussion. Acquisition of IFMG On November 7, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of IFMG Securities, Inc., Independent Financial Marketing Group, Inc. and LSC Insurance Agency of Arizona, Inc. (collectively IFMG). The purpose of this acquisition was to transfer IFMGs relationships with financial institution clients to other broker-dealer subsidiaries of the Company. In conjunction with its acquisition of IFMG, the Company announced a shutdown plan (the Shutdown Plan), which offered relocation and employment to certain employees and terminated the remaining operations of IFMG within twelve months following the acquisition. The total purchase price was $39.0 million, including initial purchase consideration of $25.7 million, as well as $7.1 million in post-closing payments made through 2008 based on the successful recruitment and retention of certain institutional relationships. As part of the purchase price allocation, the Company estimated the value of intangible assets for relationships with advisors and financial institutions and product sponsors to be $25.6 million, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives of 10 years. Additionally, the value of certain technology and non-compete agreements has been estimated at $1.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively, both of which are being amortized over 3 years. In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company made retention payments to financial institutions doing business through IFMG as an incentive to convert to one of the Companys other technology and clearing platforms. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has paid $0.9 million in retention payments, which are classified as other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition, and are being amortized over the life of the contractual agreements, ranging from six months to six years. As part of the Shutdown Plan, the Company evaluated whether or not it will utilize certain long term contractual relationships with vendors of IFMG. Consequently, the Company cancelled various contracts resulting in $2.3 million in cancellation charges. Cancellation fees and any estimated losses attributable to vendor and or lease contracts have been recorded as additional purchase price consideration. 4. Restructuring Strategic Business Review Initiative On December 29, 2008, the Company committed to and implemented an organizational restructuring plan intended to reduce its cost structure and improve operating efficiencies, which resulted in a reduction in its overall workforce of approximately 250 employees. In accordance with ASC Topic 420, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities , the Company has recorded severance and one-time involuntary termination benefit accruals in accounts payable and accrued liabilities within the consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company completed this initiative and expects to pay all costs by April, 2011. F-43 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) The following table summarizes the balance of accrued expenses related to the strategic business review and the changes in the accrued amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Accrued Accrued Cumulative Balance at Balance at Costs December 31, Costs December 31, Incurred 2008 Incurred(1) Payments Non-cash 2009 to Date(2) Severance and benefits $ 14,533 $ (467 ) $ (12,070 ) $  $ 1,996 $ 14,505 (1) Represent changes in the Companys estimates for the cost of providing post employment benefits to employees impacted by its restructuring activities. (2) At December 31, 2009, cumulative costs incurred to date represent the total expected costs. Consolidation of Affiliated Entities Initiative On July 10, 2009, the Company committed to a corporate restructuring plan that consolidated the operations of the Affiliated Entities with LPL Financial. This restructuring was effected to enhance service offerings to financial advisors while also generating efficiencies. The Company expects total costs associated with the initiative to be approximately $74.2 million. The Company incurred the majority of these costs in 2009 and anticipates recognizing the remaining costs by December 2013; however, adjustments may occur due to estimates of abandoned lease obligations with terms that extend through 2018. The Company paid charges related to the conversion and transfer of certain advisors associated with the Affiliated Entities and their client accounts. Following the completion of these transfer activities, the registered representatives and client accounts that transferred are associated with LPL Financial. As a condition for the regulatory approval of the transfer, the Affiliated Entities were required to deposit $12.8 million into escrow accounts pending the resolution of certain matters, of which $7.3 million has been released as of December 31, 2009. The adequacy of these escrow accounts is evaluated quarterly. These escrow accounts are considered restricted cash and included in other assets within the consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company paid charges related to early termination costs associated with certain contracts held by the Affiliated Entities (see Note 14). Additionally, the Company recorded severance costs and one-time involuntary termination benefits associated with the elimination of 189 positions and will recognize these accruals ratably over the employees remaining service period. The Company recorded non-cash charges for the impairment of intangible assets resulting from advisor attrition and discontinued use of certain brand names and logos (see Note 10), and fixed assets associated with abandoned lease arrangements. The Company also recognized charges related to the early termination and partial abandonment of certain lease arrangements offset by estimates for sub-lease efforts. The Company anticipates additional costs of approximately $2.8 million related to the abandonment of the remaining office space, which can not be fully estimated until the date of abandonment. F-44 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) The following table summarizes the balance of accrued expenses and the changes in the accrued amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Accrued Accrued Total Balance at Balance at Expected December 31, Costs December 31, Restructuring 2008 Incurred(1) Payments Non-cash 2009 Costs Severance and benefits $  $ 9,436 $ (6,551 ) $ (126 ) $ 2,759 $ 11,356 Lease and contract termination fees  15,919 (8,358 ) (103 ) 7,458 19,079 Asset impairments  19,924  (19,924 )  20,238 Conversion and transfer costs  13,883 (11,222 ) (2,357 ) 304 23,483 Total $  $ 59,162 $ (26,131 ) $ (22,510 ) $ 10,521 $ 74,156 (1) At December 31, 2009, costs incurred represent the total cumulative costs incurred. 5. Equity Method Investment On May 11, 2007, the Company acquired for $5.0 million, an approximate 22.6% ownership interest in Blue Frog Solutions, Inc. (Blue Frog). This investment provides the Company with a strategic ownership interest in one of its vendors that provides technology for variable annuity order entry and monitoring. The Company follows the equity method of accounting, as it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, primarily through a representation on the Board of Directors. The Company has classified its equity method investment within other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition, and has recognized its share of earnings or losses in the consolidated statements of income in loss on equity method investment. Such losses were $0.3 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In June 2008, the Company determined that an other than temporary impairment existed due to the recapitalization of Blue Frog by an outside investor. Accordingly, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $1.7 million, representing the difference in the carrying value of its investment compared with the per share value implied by the transaction. Such loss is calculated on the consolidated statements of income as a loss on equity method investment. The Company has retained a 13.9% ownership interest and a seat on the Board of Directors. 6. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized within a three-level fair value hierarchy. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:  Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2  Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. F-45 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued)  Level 3  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. The Companys fair value measurements are evaluated within the fair value hierarchy, based on the nature of inputs used to determine the fair value at the measurement date. At December 31, 2008, the Company had the following financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: Cash Equivalents  The Companys cash equivalents include money market funds, which are short term in nature with readily determinable values derived from active markets. Securities Segregated Under Federal and Other Regulations  The Companys segregated accounts contain U.S. treasury securities that are short term in nature with readily determinable values derived from quoted prices in active markets. Securities Owned and Securities Sold But Not Yet Purchased  The Companys trading securities consist of house account model portfolios for the purpose of benchmarking the performance of its fee based advisory platforms and temporary positions resulting from the processing of client transactions. Examples of these securities include money market funds, U.S. treasuries, mutual funds, certificates of deposit, traded equity securities and debt securities. The Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of its trading securities. Prices received from the pricing services are validated using various methods including comparison to prices received from additional pricing services, comparison to available quoted market prices and review of other relevant market data including implied yields of major categories of securities. In general, these quoted prices are derived from active markets for identical assets or liabilities. When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities are not available, the quoted prices are based on similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. For certificates of deposit and treasury securities, the Company utilizes market-based inputs including observable market interest rates that correspond to the remaining maturities or the next interest reset dates. At December 31, 2009, the Company did not adjust prices received from the independent third-party pricing services. Other Assets  The Companys other assets include deferred compensation plan assets that are invested in money market funds and mutual funds which are actively traded and valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. Interest Rate Swaps  The Companys interest rate swaps are not traded on a market exchange; therefore, the fair values are determined using externally developed valuation models which include assumptions about the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) yield curve at interim reporting dates as well as counterparty credit risk and the Companys own non-performance risk. F-46 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) The Company has segregated all recurring fair value measurements into the most appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy in the tables below, based on an evaluation of inputs used to determine the fair value at December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands). Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Measurements At December 31, 2009: Assets Cash equivalents $ 223,665 $  $  $ 223,665 Securities segregated under federal and other regulations 279,579   279,579 Securities owned  trading: Money market funds 181   181 Mutual funds 6,694   6,694 Equity securities 11   11 Debt securities  425  425 U.S. treasury obligations 7,797   7,797 Certificates of deposit  253  253 Total securities owned  trading 14,683 678  15,361 Other assets 12,739   12,739 Total assets at fair value $ 530,666 $ 678 $  $ 531,344 Liabilities Securities sold but not yet purchased: Mutual funds $ 3,773 $  $  $ 3,773 U.S. treasury obligations 5   5 Equity securities 7   7 Certificates of deposit  123  123 Debt securities  95  95 Total securities sold but not yet purchased 3,785 218  4,003 Interest rate swaps  17,292  17,292 Total liabilities at fair value $ 3,785 $ 17,510 $  $ 21,295 Certain assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value measurement in certain circumstances, for example, when evidence of impairment exists. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded asset impairment charges of $18.6 million for certain intangible assets that were determined to have no estimated fair value (see Note 10). The fair value was determined based on the loss of future expected cash flows for advisors who were not retained as a result of the consolidation of the Affiliated Entities, as well as the discontinued use of certain brand names and logos and their lack of marketability. The Company has determined that the impairment qualifies as a Level 3 measurement under the fair value hierarchy. F-47 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets On September 15, 2009, and in conjunction with the Companys consolidation initiative, intangible assets residing at the Affiliated Entities were transferred to LPL Financial. This exchange has occurred between entities under common control and accordingly, the Company transferred advisor relationship and sponsor relationship intangible assets at their approximate carrying amounts of $30.9 million and $11.9 million, respectively. There was no change in the useful lives of the intangible assets, which continue to be amortized over a period of 10 to 20 years. At the time of consolidation, a portion of the advisor relationships and trademarks and trade names of the Affiliated Entities were determined to have no future economic benefit. Accordingly, the Company recorded impairment charges of $16.1 million for advisor relationships and $1.1 million for trademarks and trade names. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded an additional impairment charge of $1.4 million for advisor relationships. The impairment of advisor relationships was determined based upon the attrition of advisor and their related revenue streams during the period of consolidation. The impairment of trademarks and trade names was based upon the discontinued use of brand names and logos of the Affiliated Entities. The Company has recorded the asset impairments as restructuring charges (see Note 4) and has classified them as such on its consolidated statements of income.

Of this total, $2.6 million represents amounts acquired during the Companys acquisition of the Affiliated Entities. The acquired unrecognized tax benefits will have no impact on the Companys annual effective tax rate as these are fully indemnified by the seller in accordance with the purchase and sale agreement. Of the remaining $17.7 million, $13.1 million (net of the federal benefit on state issues) represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in any future periods. The following table reflects a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties (in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 Balance  Beginning of year $ 20,258 $ 15,139 $ 8,533 Increases related to acquired tax positions 142 969 2,725 Increases related to current year tax positions 4,066 6,480 5,657 Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations related to acquired tax positions (627 ) (596 ) (524 ) Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations related to prior period tax positions (1,881 ) (1,734 ) (1,252 ) Balance  End of year $ 21,958 $ 20,258 $ 15,139 F-53 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) At December 31, 2009, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $22.0 million. Of this total, $2.1 million represents amounts acquired due to the Companys acquisition of the Affiliated Entities. The acquired unrecognized tax benefits will have no impact on the Companys annual effective tax rate as these are fully indemnified by the seller in accordance with the purchase and sale agreement. At December 31, 2009, the Company has recorded a receivable from seller in the amount of $2.1 million, which is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition. Of the remaining $19.9 million, $14.4 million (net of the federal benefit on state issues) represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in any future periods. The Company accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income taxes within the consolidated statements of financial condition. At January 1, 2009, the Company had $1.3 accrued for interest and $2.9 million accrued for penalties. At December 31, 2009, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits included accrued interest of $1.9 million and penalties of $3.4 million. Tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes interest expense of $0.6 million and penalties of $0.5 million. The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the federal jurisdiction, as well as most state jurisdictions, and are subject to routine examinations by the respective taxing authorities. The Company has concluded all federal and state income tax matters for years through 2004, with the exception of California, which has concluded income tax matters for years through 2003. The tax years of 2005 to 2009 remain open to examination by major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject, with the exception of California discussed above. In the next 12 months, the Company expects a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $3.9 million primarily related to the statute of limitations expiration in various state jurisdictions. 12. Indebtedness Senior Secured Credit Facilities  Borrowings under the Companys senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a base rate equal to either one, two, three, six, nine or twelve-month LIBOR plus the applicable margin, or an alternative base rate (ABR) plus the applicable margin. The ABR is equal to the greater of the prime rate or the effective federal funds rate plus 1 / 2 of 1.00%. The applicable margin on the senior secured term credit facilities could change depending on the Companys credit rating. The senior secured credit facilities are subject to certain financial and nonfinancial covenants. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. Senior Unsecured Subordinated Notes  The Company has $550.0 million of senior unsecured subordinated notes due December 15, 2015. The notes bear interest at 10.75% per annum and interest payments are payable semiannually in arrears. The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking-fund payments with respect to the notes. The indenture underlying the senior unsecured subordinated notes contains various restrictions with respect to the issuer, including one or more restrictions relating to limitations on liens, sale and leaseback arrangements and funded debt of subsidiaries. Revolving Line of Credit  The Company maintains a $100.0 million revolving line of credit facility, $10.0 million of which is being used to support the issuance of an irrevocable letter of credit for its subsidiary, PTC. Borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility bear interest at a base rate equal to the one, two, three, six, nine or twelve-month LIBOR plus an interest rate margin of an additional 2.00% or an ABR plus the applicable margin of 1.00%. The Company also pays a fee of F-54 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) 0.375% for the unused balance. At December 31, 2008, the Company had a balance outstanding of $90.0 million. There was no outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit at December 31, 2009. On January 25, 2010, the Company amended its senior secured credit facilities to increase the revolving credit facility from $100.0 million to $218.2 million. The Company also extended the maturity of a $163.5 million tranche of the revolving facility to June 28, 2013, with the remaining $54.7 million tranche maturing at the original maturity date of December 28, 2011. The tranche maturing in 2013 is priced at LIBOR + 3.50% with a commitment fee of 0.75% The tranche maturing in 2011 maintains its current pricing of LIBOR + 2.00% with a commitment fee of 0.375%. Bank Loans Payable  The Company maintains two uncommitted lines of credit. One line has an unspecified limit, and is primarily dependent on the Companys ability to provide sufficient collateral. The other line has a $100.0 million limit and allows for both collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings. Both lines were utilized during the years, but there were no balances outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008. The Companys outstanding borrowings were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2009 2008 Interest Interest Maturity Balance Rate Balance Rate Revolving line of credit 12/28/2011 $   % $ 90,000 2.46 %(3) Senior secured term loan: Unhedged 6/28/2013 419,223 2.00 %(1) 332,647 2.23 %(4) Hedged with interest rate swaps 6/28/2013 400,000 2.00 %(2) 495,000 3.21 %(5) Senior unsecured subordinated notes 12/15/2015 550,000 10.75 % 550,000 10.75 % Total borrowings 1,369,223 1,467,647 Less current borrowings (maturities within 12 months) 8,424 8,424 Long-term borrowings  net of current portion $ 1,360,799 $ 1,459,223 (1) As of December 31, 2009, the variable interest rate for the unhedged portion of the senior secured term loan is based on the three-month LIBOR of 0.25%, plus the applicable interest rate margin of 1.75%.

(5) As of December 31, 2008, the variable interest rate for the hedged portion of the senior secured term loan is based on the three-month LIBOR of 1.46%, plus the applicable interest rate margin of 1.75%.

Interest Rate Swaps An interest rate swap is a financial derivative instrument whereby two parties enter into a contractual agreement to exchange payments based on underlying interest rates. The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability on its floating rate senior secured term loan. The Company is required to pay the counterparty to the agreement fixed interest payments on a notional balance and in turn, receives variable interest payments on that notional balance. Payments are settled quarterly on a net basis. The following table summarizes information related to the Companys interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Variable Notional Fixed Receive Fair Maturity Balance Pay Rate Rate(1) Value Date 70,000 3.43% 0.25% $ (1,087) June 30, 2010 120,000 4.79% 0.25% (2,672) June 30, 2010 145,000 4.83% 0.25% (8,406) June 30, 2011 65,000 4.85% 0.25% (5,127) June 30, 2012 $400,000 $(17,292) (1) The variable receive rate reset on the last day of the period, based on the applicable three-month LIBOR. The effective rate from September 30, 2009 through December 30, 2009, was 0.28%. As of December 31, 2009, the effective rate was 0.25%. The interest rate swap agreements qualify for hedge accounting and have been designated as cash flow hedges against specific payments due on the Companys senior secured term loan. As of December 31, 2009, the Company assessed the interest rate swap agreements as being highly effective and expects them to continue to be highly effective. Accordingly, the changes in fair value of F-56 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) the interest rate swaps have been recorded as other comprehensive loss, with the fair value included as a liability on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company has reclassified $16.6 million and $6.0 million from other comprehensive loss as additional interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Based on current interest rate assumptions and assuming no additional interest rate swap agreements are entered into, the Company expects to reclassify $17.3 million or $11.3 million after tax, from other comprehensive loss as additional interest expense over the next 12 months. 14. Commitments and Contingencies Leases  The Company leases certain office space and equipment at its headquarter locations under various operating leases. These leases are generally subject to scheduled base rent and maintenance cost increases, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the leases. Service Contracts  The Company is party to certain long-term contracts for systems and services that enable back office trade processing and clearing for its product and service offerings. One agreement, for clearing services, contains no minimum annual purchase commitment, but the agreement provides for certain penalties should the Company fail to maintain a certain threshold of client accounts. In 2009, the number of client accounts declined below the threshold, and as a result, the Company incurred fees of $9.1 million, which have been classified as restructuring charges within the consolidated statements of income. Further declines in accounts on this clearing platform could subject the Company to future costs or penalties. Future minimum payments under leases, lease commitments and other noncancellable contractual obligations with remaining terms greater than one year as of December 31, 2009, are as follows (in thousands): Years ending December 31 2010 $ 27,543 2011 27,445 2012 20,495 2013 13,662 2014 7,483 Thereafter 16,324 Total $ 112,952 Total rental expense for all operating leases was approximately $20.1 million, $22.1 million and $14.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Guarantees  The Company occasionally enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require it to indemnify certain parties against third-party claims. The terms of these obligations vary and, because a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated, the Company has determined that it is not possible to make an estimate of the amount that it could be obligated to pay under such contracts. The Companys subsidiaries provide guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under their standard membership agreements, which require a member to guarantee the performance of other members. Under these agreements, if a member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, all other members would be required to meet any shortfall. The Companys liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the cash and securities it has posted as collateral. However, the potential requirement for the Company to make F-57 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) payments under these agreements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these transactions. Loan Commitments  From time to time, the Company makes loans to its advisors, primarily to newly recruited advisors to assist in the transition process. Due to timing differences, the Company may make commitments to issue such loans prior to actually funding them. These commitments are generally contingent upon certain events occurring, including but not limited to the advisor joining the Company, and may be forgivable. The Company had no unfunded commitments at December 31, 2009. Litigation  The Company has been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, the Company cannot predict with certainty what the eventual loss or range of loss related to such matters will be. The Company recognizes a legal liability when it believes it is probable a liability has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Defense costs are expensed as incurred and classified as professional services within the consolidated statements of income. In connection with various acquisitions, and pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements, the Company has received third-party indemnification for certain legal proceedings and claims. These matters have been defended and paid directly by the indemnifying party. On October 1, 2009, LPLH received written notice from a third-party indemnitor under a certain purchase and sale agreement asserting that it is no longer obligated to indemnify the Company for certain claims under the provisions of the purchase and sale agreement. The Company believes that this assertion is without merit and has commenced litigation to enforce its indemnity rights. The Company believes, based on the information available at this time, after consultation with counsel, consideration of insurance, if any, and the indemnifications provided by the third-party indemnitors, notwithstanding the assertions by an indemnifying party noted in the preceding paragraph, that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on consolidated statements of financial condition, income or cash flows. Other Commitments  As of December 31, 2009, the Company had received collateral primarily in connection with client margin loans with a market value of approximately $227.9 million, which it can sell or repledge. Of this amount, approximately $158.8 million has been pledged or sold as of December 31, 2009; $141.6 million was pledged to banks in connection with unutilized secured margin lines of credit, $10.0 million was pledged with client-owned securities to the Options Clearing Corporation, and $7.2 million was loaned to the DTC through participation in its Stock Borrow Program. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had received collateral primarily in connection with client margin loans with a market value of approximately $335.9 million, which it can sell or repledge. Of this amount, approximately $152.3 million has been pledged or sold as of December 31, 2008; $143.8 million was pledged to banks in connection with unutilized secured margin lines of credit, $3.2 million was pledged with client-owned securities to the Options Clearing Corporation, and $5.3 million was loaned to the DTC through participation in its Stock Borrow Program. Innovex ceased operations on December 31, 2007. Prior to that date, Innovex sold its mortgage loans without recourse. Innovex was usually required by the buyers (investors) of these loans to make certain representations concerning credit information, loan documentation, and collateral. Innovex did not repurchase any loans during the year ended December 31, 2007. In August of 2007, pursuant to agreements with a large global insurance company, LPL Financial began providing brokerage, clearing and custody services on a fully disclosed basis; offering its F-58 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) investment advisory programs and platforms; and providing technology and additional processing and related services to its financial advisors and clients. The terms of the agreements are five years, subject to additional 24-month extensions. Termination fees may be payable by a terminating or breaching party depending on the specific cause of termination. 15. Share-Based Compensation Certain employees, advisors, officers and directors who contribute to the success of the Company participate in various stock option plans. In addition, certain financial institutions participate in a warrant plan. Stock options and warrants generally vest in equal increments over a three- to five-year period and expire on the 10th anniversary following the date of grant. The Company recognized $6.5 million, $4.6 million and $2.2 million of share-based compensation related to employee stock option awards during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted was $31.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.98 years. The Company recognized $1.6 million and $0.30 million of share based compensation during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to the vesting of stock options and warrants awarded to its advisors and financial institutions. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense for stock options and warrants awarded to its advisors and financial institutions based on the fair value of awards at each interim reporting period. As of December 31, 2009, total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted was $11.4 million for advisors and financial institutions, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 4.36 years. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used by the Company in calculating the fair value of its stock options and warrants with the Black-Scholes valuation model for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: 2009 2008 2007 Expected life (in years) 7.13 6.52 6.50 Expected stock price volatility 51.35 % 33.78 % 31.08 % Expected dividend yield    Annualized forfeiture rate 4.35 % 1.51 % 1.00 % Fair value of options $ 12.30 $ 9.96 $ 9.86 Risk-free interest rate 2.93 % 2.73 % 4.93 % The risk-free interest rates are based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of the grant with remaining terms equivalent to the respective expected terms of the options. The dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that the Company has no present intention to pay cash dividends. In the future, as the Company gains historical data for volatility of its own stock and the actual term over which employees hold its options, expected volatility and the expected term may change, which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, compensation recorded on future grants. The Company estimates the expected term for its employee option awards using the simplified method in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 110, Certain Assumptions Used in Valuation Methods , because the Company does not have sufficient relevant historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns. The Company estimates the expected term for stock options and warrants awarded to its advisors and financial institutions using the contractual term. Expected volatility is calculated based on companies of similar growth and maturity and the F-59 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Companys peer group in the industry in which the Company does business because the Company does not have sufficient historical volatility data. The Company will continue to use peer group volatility information until historical volatility of the Company is relevant to measure expected volatility for future grants. The Company has assumed an annualized forfeiture rate for its stock options and warrants based on a combined review of industry and employee turnover data, as well as an analytical review performed of historical pre-vesting forfeitures occurring over the previous year. The Company records additional expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated and records a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeiture is higher than estimated.

Stock units represent the right to receive one share of F-60 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) common stock. Distribution will occur at the earliest of (a) December 31, 2012; (b) a change in control of the Company; or (c) death or disability of the participant. The issuance of stock units, which occurred in December 2008, is not taxable for federal and state income tax purposes until the participant receives a distribution under the deferred compensation plan. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had 2,823,452 stock units outstanding under the 2008 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Restricted Shares The Companys advisors participate in the fifth amended and restated 2000 Stock Bonus Plan (the Stock Bonus Plan), which provided for the grant and allocation of bonus credits. Each bonus credit represented the right to receive shares of common stock. Participation in the Stock Bonus Plan was dependent upon meeting certain eligibility criteria, and bonus credits were allocated to eligible participants based on certain performance metrics, including amount and type of commissions, as well as tenure. Bonus credits vested annually in equal increments over a three-year period and expired on the tenth anniversary following the date of grant. Unvested bonus credits held by advisors who terminated prior to vesting were forfeited and reallocated to other advisors eligible under the plan. In 2008, the Company amended and restated its Stock Bonus Plan to provide the advisors with physical ownership of common stock of the Company. Consequently, on December 28, 2008, the Company issued 7,423,973 restricted shares in exchange for bonus credits. These restricted shares may not be sold, assigned or transferred and are not entitled to receive dividends or non-cash distributions, until either a sale of the Company that constitutes a change in control or an initial public offering. The Company accounts for restricted shares granted to its advisors by measuring such grants at their then-current lowest aggregate value. Since the value is contingent upon the Companys decision to sell itself or issue its common stock to the public through a registered initial public offering, the current aggregate value will be zero until such event occurs. Upon the occurrence of such an event, the Company will record the par value, additional paid in capital and expense based on the number of restricted shares under the stock bonus plan multiplied by the fair market value determined at the event date. 16. Earnings per Share In calculating earnings per share using the two-class method, the Company is required to allocate a portion of its earnings to employees that hold stock units that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents under its 2008 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income less earnings attributable to employees that hold stock units under the 2008 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan by the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed in a manner similar to basic earnings per share, except the weighted average number of shares outstanding is increased to include the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, warrants and other stock-based awards.

Employee and Advisor Benefit Plans The Company participates in a 401(k) defined contribution plan sponsored by LPL Financial. All employees meeting minimum age and length of service requirements are eligible to participate. The Company has an employer matching program whereby employer contributions were made to the 401(k) plan. For 2009, contributions were made in an amount equal to the lesser of 20% of the amount designated by the employee for withholding or 2% of the employees eligible compensation. For 2008 and 2007, contributions were made in an amount equal to the lesser of 50% of the amount designated by the employee for withholding or 5% of the employees eligible compensation. The Companys total cost under the 401(k) plan was $1.7 million, $4.8 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for the purpose of attracting and retaining advisors who operate, for tax purposes, as independent F-62 Table of Contents LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) contractors, by providing an opportunity for participating advisors to defer receipt of a portion of their gross commissions generated primarily from commissions earned on the sale of various products. The deferred compensation plan has been fully funded to date by participant contributions. Plan assets are invested in mutual funds, which are held by the Company in a Rabbi Trust. The liability for benefits accrued under the non-qualified deferred compensation plan totaled $12.3 million at December 31, 2009, which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The cash values of the related trust assets was $12.0 million at December 31, 2009, which is measured at fair value and included in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Certain employees and advisors of the Companys subsidiaries participated in non-qualified deferred compensation plans (the Plans) that permitted participants to defer portions of their compensation and earn interest on the deferred amounts. The Plans have been closed to new participants and no contributions have been made since the acquisition date. Plan assets are held by the Company in a Rabbi Trust and accounted for in the manner described above. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has recorded assets of approximately $0.8 million and liabilities of $1.6 million, which are included in other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated statements of financial condition. 18.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Company. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, outstanding stockholder loans, which are reported as a deduction from stockholders equity, were approximately $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively. 19. Net Capital/Regulatory Requirements The Companys registered broker-dealers are subject to the SECs Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined. Net capital is calculated for each broker-dealer subsidiary individually. Excess net capital of one broker-dealer subsidiary may not be used to offset a net capital deficiency of another broker-dealer subsidiary. Net capital and the related net capital requirement may fluctuate on a daily basis. Net capital and net capital requirements for the Companys broker-dealer subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 are presented in the following table (in thousands): December 31, 2009 Minimum Net Net Capital Excess Net Capital Required Capital LPL Financial Corporation $ 64,149 $ 6,221 $ 57,928 UVEST Financial Services Group, Inc. 10,099 1,673 8,426 Total $ 74,248 $ 7,894 $ 66,354 In connection with the consolidation of the Affiliated Entities; Associated, MSC and WFG have ceased operations but continue to be required to meet certain regulatory requirements until such time that their broker-dealer license withdrawals are complete. At December 31, 2009, Associated, MSC and WFG had net capital of $7.6 million, $15.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively, which was $7.4 million, $14.7 million and $2.9 million, respectively, in excess of their minimum net capital requirements. LPL Financial is a clearing broker-dealer and the remaining broker-dealer subsidiaries are introducing broker-dealers. PTC is also subject to various regulatory capital requirements. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. The Company operates in a highly regulated industry. Applicable laws and regulations restrict permissible activities and investments. These policies require compliance with various financial and customer-related regulations. The consequences of noncompliance can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions. In addition, the Company is also subject to comprehensive examinations and supervisions by various governmental and self-regulatory agencies. These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to prescribe greater limitations on the operations of a regulated entity for the protection of investors or public interest. Furthermore, where the agencies determine that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law, or are otherwise inconsistent with the laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies, greater restrictions may be imposed.

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk LPL Financials client securities activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis. In margin transactions, LPL Financial extends credit to the client, subject to various regulatory and internal margin requirements, collateralized by cash and securities in the clients account. As clients write options contracts or sell securities short, LPL Financial may incur losses if the clients do not fulfill their obligations and the collateral in the clients accounts is not sufficient to fully cover losses that clients may incur from these strategies. To control this risk, LPL Financial monitors margin levels daily and clients are required to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary. LPL Financial is obligated to settle transactions with brokers and other financial institutions even if its clients fail to meet their obligation to LPL Financial. Clients are required to complete their transactions on the settlement date, generally three business days after the trade date. If clients do not fulfill their contractual obligations, LPL Financial may incur losses. LPL Financial has established procedures to reduce this risk by generally requiring that clients deposit cash and/or securities into their account prior to placing an order. LPL Financial may at times maintain inventories in equity securities on both a long and short basis that are recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition at market value. While long inventory positions represent LPL Financials ownership of securities, short inventory positions represent obligations of LPL Financial to deliver specified securities at a contracted price, which may differ from market prices prevailing at the time of completion of the transaction. Accordingly, both long and short inventory positions may result in losses or gains to LPL Financial as market values of securities fluctuate. To mitigate the risk of losses, long and short positions are marked-to-market daily and are continuously monitored by LPL Financial. UVEST is engaged in buying and selling securities and other financial instruments for clients of advisors. Such transactions are introduced and cleared through a third-party clearing firm on a fully disclosed basis. While introducing broker-dealers generally have less risk than clearing firms, their clearing agreements expose them to credit risk in the event that their clients dont fulfill contractual obligations with the clearing broker-dealer. The Affiliated Entities were engaged in buying and selling securities and other financial instruments for clients of advisors. Such transactions were introduced and cleared through a third-party clearing firm on a fully disclosed basis. These firms no longer conduct such activities. The registered representatives and their client accounts have either transitioned or are in the process of transitioning to LPL Financial or to new firms. 21.

Subsequent Events (Unaudited) On May 24, 2010, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement). The Amended Credit Agreement amends and restates the Companys Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 18, 2007. Pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company has established a new term loan tranche of $580.0 million maturing on June 28, 2017 (the 2017 Term Loans). The Company also extended the maturity of a $500.0 million tranche of its term loan facility to June 25, 2015 (the 2015 Term Loans), with the remaining $317.1 million tranche of the term loan facility maturing on the original maturity date of June 28, 2013 (the 2013 Term Loans). The applicable margin for borrowings with respect to the (a) 2013 Term Loans is currently 0.75% for base rate borrowings and 1.75% for LIBOR borrowings; (b) 2015 Term Loans is currently 1.75% for base rate borrowings and 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings, and (c) 2017 Term Loans is currently 2.75% for base rate borrowings and 3.75% for LIBOR borrowings. The applicable margin on our 2013 Term Loans could change depending on the Companys credit rating. The LIBOR Rate with respect to the 2015 Term Loans and the 2017 Term Loans shall in no event be less than 1.50%. On May 24, 2010, the Company gave notice of redemption of all of its outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the 2015 Notes), representing an aggregate principal amount of $550.0 million. The redemption price of the 2015 Notes is 105.375% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount, or approximately $29.6 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to but not including June 22, 2010 (the Redemption Date). The Company anticipates that the 2015 Notes will be redeemed on the Redemption Date and accordingly, will record the charge as a debt extinguishment within its consolidated statements of income. None of the 2015 Notes will remain outstanding after the Redemption Date. The Company will use the proceeds from the new term loan tranche under its Amended Credit Agreement and additional cash on hand to finance the redemption. The Company anticipates that the aggregate cash payment for the redemption, including accrued and unpaid interest, will be approximately $610.4 million.

Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL enables a corporation in its original certificates of incorporation or an amendment thereto to eliminate or limit the personal liability of a director for violations of the directors fiduciary duty, except (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) for liability of directors for unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock purchase or redemptions pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL or (iv) for any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit. Our certificate of incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for actions taken as a director to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL. Section 145(a) of the DGCL provides in relevant part that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another entity, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such persons conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contedere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such persons conduct was lawful. Section 145(b) of the DGCL provides in relevant part that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by II-1 Table of Contents reason of the fact that the person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another entity, against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. Our certificate of incorporation generally provides that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that the indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to the certificate of incorporation are not exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or otherwise. Section 145(f) of the DGCL further provides that a right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses arising under a provision of the certificate of incorporation shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to such provision after the occurrence of the act or omission which is the subject of the civil, criminal, administrative or investigation action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought. We and our subsidiary LPL Holdings, Inc. have also entered into indemnification agreements with certain of our directors and officers. Such agreements generally provide for indemnification by reason of being our director or officer, as the case may be. These agreements are in addition to the indemnification provided by our and LPL Holdings, Inc.s charters and bylaws. We also obtained officers and directors liability insurance which insures against liabilities that officers and directors of the registrant may, in such capacities, incur. Section 145(g) of the DGCL provides that a corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another entity, against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under that section. Pursuant to the stockholders agreement entered into with certain stockholders, the company has agreed to indemnify such stockholders from certain liabilities incurred in connection with this registration statement. The underwriting agreement we will enter into in connection with the offering of common stock described in this registration statement provides for indemnification by the underwriters of the registrant and its executive officers and directors, and by the registrant of the underwriters, for certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act. Also see Undertakings. Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities. The following sets forth information regarding all unregistered securities sold during the last three fiscal years.

Item 17. Undertakings. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that: (1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b) (1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
