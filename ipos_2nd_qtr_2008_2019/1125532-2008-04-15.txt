It does not contain all of the information that you should consider before investing in our common stock. You should read the entire prospectus carefully, including the section entitled "Risk Factors" and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Our Company We are a consumer products company selling high quality household, beauty and personal care products at affordable prices. We sell directly to consumers by advertising on television, in print media, on the Internet, and occasionally on the radio, through telemarketing and mass mailing. We also sell our products on a wholesale basis to national retail and drugstore chains, home shopping channels, catalogue proprietors, and international distributors. We endeavor to create and develop, or obtain exclusive licenses to, products that we believe will appeal and deliver value to our target audience, which is essentially the mass consumer market. Our selection of products depends on many factors and criteria, chief among which is the suitability of a particular product to the way in which, and the channels through which, we market and sell. We are currently marketing and selling fourteen (14) products under seven (7) product lines, of wh ich we own three (3) product lines (comprising 6 products) and have exclusive licenses or distribution rights to four (4) product lines (comprising 8 products). Additional information about out products, our marketing and sales, and other aspects of our business can be found in the section of this document titled The Company beginning on page 11. With our acquisition of Worldwide Excellence, Inc. (WWE) in November of 2005, we experienced a change in control with the two former stockholders of WWE becoming the owners of in excess of a majority of our outstanding common stock. We also experienced a shift in the primary nature of our business to that of the consumer products business briefly described above. Prior to acquisition, WWE was a private company whose business was founded in 2001. Under applicable accounting rules, our financial statements for periods prior to November 29, 2005, reflect the results of WWE alone. In August of 2006, our business was further transformed by our acquisition of the consumer products division of Adsouth Partners, Inc. In addition to expanding our portfolio of consumer products, this acquisition resulted in our succession to Adsouths network of independent retail sales representatives and vendor relationships with various national retail chains. WWE had historically sold to retail outlets, if at all, through distributors as opposed to being a vendor of record directly with the retail chains. Additional information about each of the WWE and Adsouth acquisitions can be found in the section of this document titled The Company under the subheading Development of the Business beginning on page 11. We incurred fiscal year net losses in 2006 and 2007 of approximately $2.8 million and $3.4 million respectively, on respective period revenues of approximately $23.1 million and $36.3 million. Additional information about our financial results can be found in the section of this document titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 21. On November 13, 2007, we and four funds advised by RENN Capital Group Inc. (Selling Shareholders) entered into a securities purchase agreement (the SPA) pursuant to which we sold (i) 6,666,667 shares of Company common stock and (ii) five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,666,667 shares of common stock, one-half exercisable at $1.00 per share and one-half exercisable at $1.50 per share, for a total purchase price of $4 million. We also agreed to register such shares and the shares underlying the warrants for resale in accordance with the terms of a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the SPA and are fulfilling our agreement by filing the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The Offering Outstanding Common Stock 29,243,263 shares as of March 31, 2008 Common Stock Offered 13,333,334 shares of common stock, including 6,666,667 shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants, (one-half exercisable at $1.00 per share and one-half exercisable at $1.50 per share). Proceeds The warrants contain both cash and cashless exercise provisions. We may receive proceeds upon the exercise of the warrants which, if all such warrants are exercised in full and in cash, would be $8,333,334. The Selling Shareholders are under no obligation to exercise their warrants. Proceeds, if any, received from the exercise of warrants will be used for general corporate purposes. Risk Factors The securities offered hereby involve a high degree of risk. See Risk Factors. OTC Bulletin Board Symbol VBDG 1 RISK FACTORS Our business, financial condition and operating results, or the value of any investment you make in the stock of our Company, or both, could be adversely affected by any of the factors listed and described below. These risks and uncertainties, however, are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or the value of your investment. We have a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our prospects can be based. Investment in our common stock is more speculative in nature than in that of a company with a longer operating history and record of performance. We have a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our prospects can be based. Our prospects for financial success must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in relatively new and rapidly evolving markets, and by companies employing new or unproven approaches to reaching established markets. The period of time for which information is available about our financial performance may make an investment in the stock of our company more speculative in nature than in that of a company with a longer operating history and record of performance. We have incurred losses for our two most recently reported fiscal years, and our inability to remain profitable through sales of products we have introduced and expect to introduce could cause us to go out of business and for you to lose your entire investment. We incurred losses for the full years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 of approximately $3.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2007 was approximately $9.8 million. Our ability to attain profitability and to grow depends upon continuing sales of products we currently have on the market as well as our ability to successfully bring new products to market. If we fail in either or both of these regards, we may not be able to realize profits and may ultimately go out of business. Moreover, we cannot provide any assurance that any of our business strategies will be successful or that future growth in revenues or profitability will ever be achieved or, if they are achieved, that they can be consistently sustained or increased on a quarterly or annual basis. We may require additional funds to operate, develop and expand our business, and if we cannot gain access to such funds on acceptable terms or at all, our ability to operate our business as presently conducted or planned could be materially impaired . We require significant, up-front cash disbursements to operate our business, most notably in connection with the purchase of product inventory. Our cash from operations and borrowing capacity under an existing $5 million asset-backed line of credit may be insufficient to grow our business and to capitalize on strategic opportunities as they arise, including with respect to the introduction of products presently in development and the expansion of the market for our existing products. Our failure to generate cash flow from operations or raise the necessary additional capital could affect our ability to generate revenue and could require us to scale down some or all of our operations. We are also exposed to interest rate risks under our current credit agreements. If interest rates rise to a level that renders borrowing under our current line of credit cost-prohibitive, our access to capital could be further limited. Our need to seek additional financing sooner than we anticipate could also result from any of the following factors: · changes in operating plans; · acceleration of our business development plans; · lower than anticipated sales; · increased costs of business development; · increased operating costs; · our inability to service existing debt obligations or fulfill all covenants or terms associated with such obligations resulting in acceleration of repayment or other penalties; or · potential acquisitions. If we need to raise additional capital from equity or debt sources, the provider of such capital may impose limits on our financial and operating flexibility. We cannot provide any assurance that financing arrangements will be available to the Company or, if available, that they will be on acceptable terms. Furthermore, any additional issuance of equity or equity-related securities would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders. If we are unable to adapt to rapid industry change our sales and profitability will be adversely affected. Both the direct response, or what we refer to as transactional marketing of consumer products, as well as sales of consumer products at retail stores, is characterized by constant new product introductions and other products coming to the end of their market life cycle. To be successful, we must adapt to our rapidly changing markets. Our success will depend, in part, on our 2 ability to develop or license marketable products, enhance our existing products and services, and develop new offerings that address the needs of our customers. Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property and marketing rights could negatively impact our business. The protection of our intellectual property rights is, and will continue to be, important to the success of our business. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate, our brands and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers and sales. The transactional marketing industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete effectively. The transactional marketing industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant change and intense marketing by providers of similar products. We expect that new competitors are likely to join existing competitors in this industry, including the market for continuity programs that we target. Some of our current competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial, technical, operational, marketing and other resources and experience than we do. In this regard, larger, better-financed competitors may be able to spend more than us, or sustain losses, on advertising media in connection with the rollout of a product under a Continuity program. The Retail Distribution business is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete effectively. The retail marketplace is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to changes beyond our control such as business consolidations among prospective customers which reduces our market opportunity. We are presently competing in many cases against larger and better financed competitors who compete in every category of product for limited shelf space. There is intense competition for shelf space, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to sell new products into retail on terms that would be economically feasible. We are competing against competitors who are larger, better financed and able to spend more in trade allowances and other incentives which could reduce our ability to place our products on retail shelf space. If we are unable to retain our key management personnel our business may be adversely affected. We are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers and senior management and on our ability to hire and retain qualified management personnel. The loss of services by any of these individuals could materially and adversely affect our business and our future prospects. We believe that our executive officers and members of senior management in many cases possess skills and experience in their respective areas of responsibility that are unique to the business of consumer product marketing and distribution and that, should the need to replace them arise, we might experience difficulty locating and/or retaining persons of similar experience and expertise. In addition, as a relatively small and entrepreneurial organization with only 27 employees, the impact of the loss of key employees could be disproportionately felt. We also anticipate that, in order to successfully implement our business strategy, we will be required to recruit and hire additional qualified personnel. Failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, including management personnel who will train and integrate our new employees in addition to their role in continuing to manage our growth strategy could adversely affect us. Our business entails exposure to product liability claims which, should any such claims arise and regardless of whether such claims have merit, could adversely affect our business and/or financial condition. We are subject to product liability claims of various kinds, or to claims relating to the efficacy of our products or the accuracy of labeling, warnings, and claims made. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to avoid such claims or that we will be successful in defending any such claims should any arise. Any litigation, regardless of the outcome, would entail significant costs and use of management time, which could impair our ability to generate revenue and profit. In the event that we have liability from a claim relating to any of our products, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover our liability. Although we presently have product liability insurance, it may not be available in the future at a reasonable cost, if at all. We may also be subject to potential claims of infringement of third party intellectual property or similar rights despite our efforts to effectively protect our intellectual property and clear our use of product trade nam es and marketing materials. Our dependence upon third parties to supply our products exposes us to various risks . We do not manufacture any of our products. All of our products are manufactured for us by non-affiliated manufacturers pursuant to purchase orders, and we do not have any long-term agreements with any supplier. We rely upon our suppliers to develop and test their prototypes, and manufacture the products to our standards, subject to our internal quality assurance and third party testing procedures, and to produce a uniform product for us in facilities that comply with applicable laws, to implement adequate quality control procedures and to deliver product to us in a timely manner. The failure of our suppliers to do any of the foregoing could affect both our ability to deliver quality products in a timely manner. Further, in the event that we change suppliers, there can be no assurance that there will be a smooth transition to a new supplier or that we will not encounter other serious problems in the quality or delivery of products resulting from a change in supplier. 3 Breaches in our third party Internet network security systems may adversely affect us. Any breaches to our Internet network security systems could jeopardize the security of our confidential information or that of third parties stored on the network. To date, we have not experienced any breaches of our network but, there can be no assurance that breaches of these Internet network security systems will not happen in the future. Breaches of our network could result in the loss of our customers confidential information which would damage our relationship with our customers and harm our business. If we are unable to attract new customers, retain our present customers, and maintain customer satisfaction, our business will be adversely affected. Our success and growth in revenues will depend heavily on the extent to which we maintain and expand our customer base for our products. There is no assurance that we will succeed with this endeavor and if we do not attract new customers, retain our present customers, and maintain customer satisfaction, our growth strategy will be adversely affected. Our business may be adversely impacted by regulation at the local, state, federal and international levels. We are subject to varying degrees of international, federal, state and local regulation. Significant consumer protection regulations are imposed at each of these levels. All transactional marketers are governed by the Federal Trade Commission Act, including its provisions prohibiting deceptive practices in connection the advertising, marketing and sale of consumer products. We make efforts to ensure that our marketing at all times complies with applicable standards. Nevertheless, the commencement of a proceeding against us with respect to one or more of our products could have an adverse effect on our future operations. Any proceeding, regardless of the outcome, would entail significant costs and use of management time, which could impair our ability to generate revenue and profit. Our business may be adversely impacted by Headline Risk. Adverse publicity generated from, for example, a defective product, a product recall or the commencement of a proceeding by a governmental agency could discourage current customers from continuing to use our products or discourage prospective customers from trying our products. In addition our suppliers, due to the adverse publicity, may refuse to do business with us. If any of these situations or other examples of Headline Risk occur, our business will be adversely affected. Since there are a small number of major retail chains for sales of our products, the loss of any of these customers could result in a significant decrease in both revenues and income. In 2007, 17.9% and 11.9% of consumer product segment revenues were derived from two customers, the larger of which was WalMart. If we were to be unable to offer new product to our limited number of large retail distribution customers, we could lose that source of revenue. We are dependent upon the purchasing and return policies of these discount retailer chains, which may impair our ability to operate profitably by reducing our gross margins and increasing our selling, general and administrative expenses. Our retail distribution in large part involves the sale of our product to discount chains. We are subject to their policies on such matters as accepting and scheduling deliveries, payment and returns. In order to sell products to these chains we may have to place reserves against the accounts receivables from these chains, which may impair our ability to operate profitably by reducing our gross margins and increasing our selling, general and administrative expenses. Depending on the retailer and the product, we currently reserve between 10% and 26% of our sales to these discount chains. If we are not successful in licensing, developing, and marketing products that sell at retail stores, our business will be adversely affected. Our ability to generate profits is dependent upon a number of factors, including: (i) our ability to maintain our existing shelf space and desirable displays in retail stores, in the face of competition from numerous major and specialty product companies that presently dominate the market for those products; (ii) our ability to price our products at levels that make them attractive to retail customers and enable us to generate a sufficient gross margin to enable us to generate profits from the sales; (iii) the consumers response to our products, including their willingness to make repeat purchases; and (iv) our ability to develop brand recognition by advertising for our products. If we are not able to retain shelf space or if the consumers response to our products is not favorable, we may be unable to continue in this business. We cannot assure that we will be successful in generating either adequate shelf space or customer acceptance. There are risks associated with our ownership and leasing of commercial real estate. Our controlling ownership interest in an office building and underlying developable land in Granby, Connecticut through our Granby subsidiary entails certain risks associated with commercial real estate generally as well as risk particular to the Granby project. Among these risks are: a limited number of potential tenants and a need for the amount of consolidated office space 4 available at Granby at commercially viable rental rates; and the risk that we will be unable to repay or refinance a second mortgage on the property prior to the maturity of a balloon payment of $1.1 million due on August 1, 2009. RISKS RELATED WITH OWNERSHIP OF OUR SECURITIES There is currently a limited trading market for our common stock. Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB). There can be no assurance that an active trading market will be maintained. Trading of securities on the OTCBB is generally limited and is on a less regular basis than that effected on other exchanges or quotation systems such as Nasdaq, and accordingly investors who own or purchase common stock will find that the liquidity or transferability of the common stock is limited. Additionally, a stockholder may find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value, of common stock. We cannot assure you that our common stock will ever be included for trading on any stock exchange or through any other quotation system (including, without limitation, Nasdaq. The application of the penny stock rules could adversely affect trading in our common stock. The trading price of our common stock is currently below $5.00 per share, which causes the open-market trading of our common stock to be a "low-priced" security under the "penny stock" rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The "penny stock" rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors, generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse. In accordance with these rules, broker-dealers participating in transactions in low-priced securities must first deliver a risk disclosure document which describes the risks associated with such stocks, the broker-dealer's duties in selling the stock, the customer's rights and remedies and certain market and other information. Furthermore, the broker-dealer must make a suitabi lity determination approving the customer for low-priced stock transactions based on the customer's financial situation, investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing to the customer, obtain specific written consent from the customer, and provide monthly account statements to the customer. The effect of these restrictions will probably decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market in our common stock, decreasing liquidity of our common stock and increase transaction costs for sales and purchases of our common stock as compared to other securities. Stockholders should be aware that, according to Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock. In addition to the penny stock rules described above, if our stock trades below $5.00 per share, which it currently does, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the number of participants in the market for our common stock, reducing its liquidity and your ability to buy and sell our stock and having an adverse effect on the market for our shares. Future sales of our common stock in the public market may depress our stock price. On February 6, 2007, we filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to register approximately 2.3 million shares of our common stock underlying options and restricted stock granted to our officers, directors, employees and consultants and approximately 2.7 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. These shares, if issued in accordance with these plans, will be eligible for immediate sale in the public market, subject to volume limitations. As of March 20, 2008, there were outstanding options convertible into approximately 2.5 million shares of our common stock, warrants convertible into approximately 12.3 million shares of our common stock, 0.9 million shares of Series A preferred stock convertible into 1.8 million shares of our common stock, and debentures that are convertible into approximately 4.2 million shares of our common stock. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the market 5 perceives that such sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could fall. The sale of a large number of shares could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our common stock. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock. We do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends, if any, will be contingent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements, and general financial condition. The holders of our 10% convertible preferred stock shall receive, out of funds legally available therefore, cumulative dividends at a rate equal to 10% of the convertible preferred stocks original issue price, in cash, or at our option, in shares of common stock. As of March 31, 2008, the balance of convertible preferred stock that accrues dividends is $1.8 million. Dividend payments of 5% of the balance are due on November 29 and May 29 annually. Any accrued dividends on the convertible preferred stock must be paid in full before we can pay a dividend on our common stock. Because we do not plan to pay dividends on our common stock, our stock may be less attractive to some investors, which could adversely affect our stock price.< /P> We may raise additional capital through a securities offering that could dilute your ownership interest and voting rights. Our certificate of incorporation currently authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of March 20, 2008, there were approximately 29.2 million shares of common stock outstanding and 900,000 shares of preferred stock outstanding. As of March 31, 2008, after taking into consideration our outstanding common and preferred shares, our board of directors will be entitled to issue up to approximately 70.8 million additional common shares and 795,000 preferred shares. The power of the board of directors to issue shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants or options to purchase shares of our stock is generally not subject to stockholder approval. Under the terms of our senior convertible debt, if the notes are converted in full by the noteholders, we will be required to issue up to approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock assuming conversion at floor of $0.69. We may require additional working capital to fund our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or convertible debt securities, these securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. The issuance of additional common stock or securities convertible into common stock by our board of directors will also have the effect of diluting the proportionate equity interest and voting power of holders of our common stock. We are controlled by our principal stockholders which includes executive officers and directors, and as a result, the trading price for our shares may be depressed and these stockholders can take actions that may be adverse to your interests. Our executive officers and directors, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 20.4% of our common stock including options, convertible preferred stock and warrants held by each executive officer and director that are exercisable within 60 days of March 31, 2008. Four principal stockholders beneficially own approximately 62.1% of our common stock. These stockholders, acting together, or as individuals, have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, they could dictate the management of our business and affairs. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover or other business combination that could be favorable to our stockholders. This significant concentration of share ownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. Our incorporation documents and Delaware law include provisions which may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and which may inhibit an attempt by our stockholders to change our direction or management, each of which could in turn also limit the market price for our stock . Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions include (i) authority for our board of directors to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to, or imposed upon, our preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series without further action by our stockholders and (ii) advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of Delaware General Corporate Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us, which may prevent or frustrate any attempt by our stockholders to change our management or the direction in which we are heading. These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions. 6 New rules, including those contained in and issued under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, may make it difficult for us to retain or attract qualified officers and directors, which could adversely affect the management of our business. We may be unable to attract and retain qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide for our effective management as a result of the recent and currently proposed changes in the rules and regulations which govern publicly-held companies, including, but not limited to, certifications from executive officers. The perceived increased personal risk associated with these recent changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting these roles. The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has resulted in the issuance of a series of new rules and regulations and the strengthening of existing rules and regulations by the SEC. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors, the management of our business could be adversely affected. We are subject to the requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are unable to timely comply with section 404 or if the costs related to compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price and results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We are required to comply with the provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require us to maintain an ongoing evaluation and integration of the internal controls of our business. We were required to document and test our internal controls and certify that we are responsible for maintaining an adequate system of internal control procedures for the year ended December 31, 2007. In subsequent years, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to opine on those internal controls and managements assessment of those controls. In the process, we may identify areas requiring improvement, and we may have to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully complete the procedures, certification and attestation requirements of Section 404 or that our auditors will not have to report a material weakness in connection with the presentation of our financial statements. Our failure to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or report by our auditors of material weaknesses could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative affect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The market price for our common shares is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively unknown company with a small and thinly-traded public float and limited operating history. The price at which you purchase our common shares may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market. You may be unable to sell your common shares at or above your purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to you. The market for our common shares is characterized by significant price volatility compared to more established issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a more established issuer for the indefinite future. The volatility in our share price is attributable to a number of factors. First, as noted above, our common shares are sporadically or thinly traded. As a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our shareholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could, for example, decline precipitously in the event that a large number of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to a more established issuer which could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price. Secondly, we are a speculative or risky investment due to our limited op erating history and limited of profits to date, limited capital to execute our business plan, and uncertainty of future market acceptance for our business strategy and other risks including those set forth above. As a consequence of these enhanced risks, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a more established issuer. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common shares, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common shares will be at any time, including as to whether our common shares will sustain their current market prices, or as to what effect, if any, that the sale of shares or the availability of common shares for sale at any time wil l have on the prevailing market price.

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES TO BE REGISTERED Common Stock Holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Subject to preferential rights with respect to any outstanding preferred stock, holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and satisfaction of preferential rights of any outstanding preferred stock. Our Common Stock has no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the Common Stock. The outstanding shares of Common Stock are fully paid and non-assessable. The foregoing description of our Common Stock is only a summary and does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified by our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and by applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporations Law. Warrants One-half of the shares of Common Stock being registered hereunder are issuable upon the exercise of warrants. One-half of the warrants are exercisable at $1.00 per share and one-half are exercisable at $1.50 per share. The warrants may be exercised for a term of five years and contain a standard net exercise (cashless) provision. The warrants also contain standard anti-dilution provisions.

Change of Control In the event of (a) a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, (b) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation (other than a merger or consolidation with a wholly-owned subsidiary, a reincorporation of the Company in a different jurisdiction, or other transaction in which there is no substantial change in the stockholders of the Company or their relative stock holdings), (c) a merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation but after which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such merger (other than any stockholder that merges, or which owns or controls another corporation that merges, with the Company in such merger) cease to own their shares or other equity interest in the Company, (d) the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, or (e) the acquisition, sale, or transfer of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Company by tender offer or similar transac tion (each of the foregoing a Corporate Transaction), then, subject to the notice requirements, the Company shall have the right to terminate and cancel the warrant effective upon the consummation of such Corporate Event.

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION The Selling Shareholders of our common stock and any of their pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares of common stock on the Principal Market or any other stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions at negotiated prices. The Selling Shareholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares: · ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits Buyers; · block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; · purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account; · an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange; · privately negotiated transactions; · settlement of short sales entered into after the date of this prospectus; · broker-dealers may agree with the Selling Shareholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share; · a combination of any such methods of sale; · through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise; or · any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. The Selling Shareholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus. Broker-dealers engaged by the Selling Shareholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling Shareholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the Buyer of shares, from the Buyer) in amounts to be negotiated. The Selling Shareholders do not expect these commissions and discounts relating to its sales of shares to exceed what is customary in the types of transactions involved. In connection with the sale of our common stock or interests therein, the Selling Shareholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The Selling Shareholders may also sell shares of our common stock short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The Selling Shareholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such tran saction). The Selling Shareholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales and may have civil liability under Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act for any omissions or misstatements in this prospectus and the registration statement of which it is a part. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. The Selling Shareholders have informed us that they do not have any agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the common stock. We are paying all expenses and fees in connection with the registration of the shares. The selling stockholders will bear all brokerage or underwriting discounts or commissions paid to broker-dealers in connection with the sale of their shares. We have agreed to indemnify the Selling Shareholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Because the Selling Shareholders may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act, the Selling Shareholders may be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. In addition, any securities covered by this prospectus that qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus. The Selling Shareholders have advised us that they have not entered into any agreements, understandings or 10 arrangements with any underwriter or broker-dealer regarding the sale or the resale of the shares. There is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale or the resale of the shares by the Selling Shareholders. We agreed to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the shares may be resold by the Selling Shareholders without registration and without regard to any volume limitations by reason of Rule 144(e) under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the shares have been sold pursuant to the prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. The resale shares will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale shares may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with. Under applicable rules and regulations under the 1934 Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale shares may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to our common stock for a period of two business days prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the Selling Shareholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of shares of our common stock by the Selling Shareholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the Selling Shareholders and have informed them of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each Buyer at or prior to the time of the sale. INTERESTS OF NAMED EXPERTS AND COUNSEL The financial statements of Vertical Branding, Inc. included in this prospectus have been audited by Holtz Rubenstein Reminick LLP, our independent certified public accountants (HRR), to the extent and for the periods set forth in their report appearing elsewhere herein and are included in reliance upon such report given upon the authority of that firm as experts in auditing and accounting. The validity of the issuance of the common shares to be sold by the Selling Shareholders under this prospectus and warrants was passed upon for our company by Richardson & Patel, LLP (R&P). Neither HRR nor R&P has been employed by us on a contingent basis with respect to the sale or registration under this prospectus of the securities to be sold by the Selling Shareholders, nor does HRR or R&P own a substantial interest in us. THE COMPANY Overview We are a consumer products company selling high quality household, beauty and personal care products at affordable prices. In addition to our consumer products business, our operations include a second smaller and non-integrated business segment which entails the ownership and leasing of certain real estate holdings in Granby, Connecticut. Additional information about our business segments and corporate structure can be found in the sub-section below entitled Information About Segments and Corporate Structure. Our mission as a consumer products company is to create and develop, or obtain exclusive licenses to, products that we believe will appeal and deliver value to our target audience, which is essentially the mass consumer market. Our selection of products depends on many factors and criteria, chief among which is the suitability of a particular product to the way in which, and the channels through which, we market and sell. We sell directly to consumers by advertising on television, in print media, on the Internet, and occasionally on the radio, through telemarketing and mass mailing. We also sell our products on a wholesale basis to national retail and drugstore chains, home shopping channels, catalogue proprietors and international distributors. We are currently marketing and selling fourteen (14) products under seven (7) product lines, of which we own three (3) product lines (comprising 6 products) and have exclusive licenses or distribution rights to four (4) product lines (comprising 8 products). Additional information about out current products, new product development and product licensing is included in the sub-section below entitled Products and Services. Our method of successfully bringing products to market typically begins with what we refer to as a transactional marketing campaign intended to build product and brand awareness while at the same time generating sales. Our transactional marketing campaigns are conducted in as many channels of consumer media as are viable for generating immediate sales in response to our product advertisements, including television, print, radio and the Internet. The fundamental difference between transactional marketing and more conventional brand advertising is that for every dollar we spend on advertising media we expect an immediate, measurable return on investment in the form of sales attributable to that dollar and that advertisement. In addition to the initial product purchase generated during a transactional marketing campaign, our goal is to market products and create product offers that result in an ongoing relationship with a customer that generates what we refer to as continuity sales. Continuity sales are essentially repeat or recurring sales of the product or product peripherals resulting from automatic shipments and billing of such items to the customer at agreed upon, pre-determined intervals. Continuity sales have the effect of increasing the rate of return on our transactional advertising dollars, increasing the lifetime value of our customer to us, and extending the lifecycle of the products that we bring to market. 11 A successful transactional marketing campaign and the brand and product awareness that it can generate supports our ultimate goal of generating wholesale sales of our products to resellers, which include national retail and drugstore chains as well as home shopping channels, catalog publishers and international distributors. These sales can often be a multiple of direct to consumer sales for products that are popular and profitable in the transactional marketing format, especially for products that have a long retail shelf life. For this reason, we concentrate on finding or developing products that we believe will not only gain initial retail acceptance, but that will be what we refer to as evergreen products, or products that will serve a purpose or fill a need of consumers for years to come. In order to further leverage our retail distribution capacities, we also develop and license products specificall y for mass market retail stores and for which little or no transactional marketing is conducted or needed. We currently have products placed with many of the nations largest retail outlets, including WalMart, Target, Costco and Bed Bath and Beyond, as well the nations major drug chains such as CVS, Walgreens and RiteAid. A more detailed description of what we mean by transactional marketing, how it works, and how it differs from brand advertising, as well as additional information about continuity sales and the various channels through which we market and sell, can be found in the sub-section below entitled Marketing and Sales. Development of the Business We were incorporated on May 18, 1990, under the laws of the State of Delaware as PSI Food Services, Inc. On August 9, 2000, we changed our name to MFC Development Corp. On October 30, 2006, we changed our name to Vertical Branding, Inc. As MFC Development Corp., our business consisted primarily of the development, lease and/or sale of certain real property and the provision of specialized financing and other services to medical practices, all conducted through wholly owned subsidiaries. Our medical financing business was conducted through Medical Financial Corp., which purchased insurance claims receivables from medical practices and provided certain services to those practices. In addition to Medical Financial Corp., we operated three other subsidiaries, Nexus Garden City, LLC, Nexus Borough Park, LLC, and FRM Court Street, LLC, all of which provided additional management services to certain medical practices. On the real estate front, our principal projects/holdings included (i) a 65-acre parcel of land in an area known as Hunter Highlands, adjacent to the Hunter Mountain Ski Slopes in the Town of Hunter, Greene County, New York (Hunter), which was owned by our wholly owned subsidiary Yolo Equities Corp. (Yolo), and (ii) an office building owned by our Gateway Granby, LLC subsidiary, of which we own 49% of the membership interests, containing approximately 52,000 square feet of rentable Class A office space located on 7.7 developable acres in East Granby, Connecticut (Granby). In August of 2004, we sold our continuing service obligations to medical practices and the related future revenue rights of our medical financing business to HealthCare Claims Collections, LLC (HCCC) in exchange for an exclusive collection agreement with HCCC with preferential collection rates on the receivables, which we expected to collect over time. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance of our receivables was $84,000, net of $19,000 of estimated collection fees. In November 2005, we completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Worldwide Excellence, Inc., a Delaware corporation (WWE), in accordance with the provisions of a certain acquisition agreement dated as of July 29, 2005 (Acquisition Agreement) among WWE, WWEs stockholders, and VBI. We acquired 100% percent of WWEs outstanding common stock in exchange for 11,500,000 shares of our common stock. As a result of the merger, the two former WWE stockholders, and their designees, became the owners of approximately 80% of our outstanding common stock. This transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger, with WWE being the acquirer for accounting purposes. Consequently, our historical results of operations became those of WWE. Prior to acquisition, WWEs business was direct to consumer marketing and sales of products in the health, beauty, fitness and household categories. The principal products being marketed at the time of acquisition were YouthFactor, an anti-wrinkle cosmetic owned by WWE, and The Body Burner, a tramp-o-lean fitness product licensed from its manufacturer. WWE earned approximately $1.5 million on revenue of $20.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, and lost, on a pro-forma basis, approximately $1.3 million on $6.6 million in revenue for the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2005. WWE remains a wholly owned subsidiary of VBI through which we conduct our transactional marketing operations. Simultaneous with our acquisition of WWE, we sold approximately 1.2 million shares of our 10% Convertible Preferred Stock, and warrants to purchase an equal number of shares of our common stock, for total financing proceeds of approximately $2.4 million. In March of 2006, we sold the Hunter property to Mountaintrail at Hunter, LLC, for $900,000. On August 1, 2006, we purchased certain assets from Adsouth Partners, Inc. (Adsouth) comprising Adsouth's consumer products division and we assumed certain associated liabilities. We purchased rights to various consumer products and brands as well as succession to Adsouths wholesale and retail distribution channels and relationships. Prior to the Adsouth acquisition, we sold our products to retail stores, if at all, indirectly through distributors. As a result of the acquisition, we became a vendor of 12 record with various national retail and drugstore chains and began selling directly to those and other accounts. The purchase price for the assets included a cash and stock component. The cash component included the payment of $1,525,000 at closing in the form of a promissory note (the Adsouth Note). The cash component was subject to adjustment after closing based on the actual value of the Adsouth assets and liabilities acquired. The stock component of the purchase price was paid by issuance of 5.5 million shares of our common stock, 750,000 shares of which were held in escrow to satisfy purchase price adjustment and potential indemnification obligations of Adsouth. We subsequently determined that the actual value of assets and liabilities acquired from Adsouth required reduction of the cash component of the purchase price by at least $843,648. Of this amount, $693,648 was satisfied by cancellation of the then remaining balance of the Adsouth Note. In July 2007, the parties agreed that the balance of the purchase price adjustment as well as release of the escrow shares would be settled by payment to us of the amount of $247,500. On August 2 and September 18, 2006, we sold 10% secured convertible notes to Gottbetter Capital Finance, LLC and its affiliate (Gottbetter) in the total principal amount of $5,775,400 (the Convertible Notes) pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement dated July 31, 2006. We used $762,500 of the proceeds to make principal payments on the Adsouth Note. On November 13, 2007, we and four funds managed by RENN Capital Group Inc. (Selling Shareholders) entered into a securities purchase agreement (the SPA) pursuant to which we sold (i) 6,666,667 shares of Company common stock, $.001 par value and (ii) five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,666,667 additional shares of common stock, one-half exercisable at $1.00 per share and one-half exercisable at $1.50 per share, for a total purchase price of $4 million. Simultaneously with the execution of the SPA, we also entered into an Agreement re Redemption of Convertible Notes (the Redemption Agreement) with the holders of the Convertible Notes (the Holders). Pursuant to the terms of the Redemption Agreement, we paid to the Holders approximately $2 million representing pre-payment of principal installments through July 31, 2008, thus reducing the outstanding principal balance on the Convertible Notes to $2.7 million. Information about Segments and Corporate Structure Our reportable segments include: (1) consumer products, (2) development, rental and/or sale of commercial real estate, and (3) other, which is comprised of corporate overhead and discontinued operations. Our consumer products business operates on a global basis from our offices in Encino, California and Boca Raton, Florida. The real estate segment operates in New York and Connecticut from an office in New Rochelle, New York. We conduct operations through certain subsidiary entities. Our transactional marketing efforts occur through our wholly owned subsidiary Worldwide Excellence, Inc. (WWE). WWE in turn is the managing member of additional subsidiary entities, the only one of which that currently has significant ongoing operations is Legacy Formulas LLC. Most of our product licensing, marketing material development and market testing occurs through Legacy Formulas. Our retail distribution is operated through our wholly owned subsidiary Adsouth Marketing LLC, of which Vertical Branding is the managing member. Finally, our real estate segment is operated through our Gateway Granby LLC subsidiary, of which we own 49% of the membership interests. We maintain control of Gateway Granby by virtue of an Irrevocable Proxy and Agreement dated November 29, 2005, under which another member of Gateway Granby owning an approximately 12% membershi p interest has granted us an irrevocable proxy to vote her interest on all matters on which Gateway Granby members are entitled to vote. The proxy is effective for so long as we maintain our 49% interest.

As of March 31, 2008, we are currently marketing and selling fourteen (14) products under seven (7) product lines, of which we own three (3) product lines (comprising 6 products) and have exclusive licenses or distribution rights to four (4) product lines (comprising 8 products). Most of these products are beauty and household products. The following is a list of our current product lines for which we have significant ongoing sales: · StarMaker Beauty Line, which is comprised of various beauty products used in the entertainment industry and developed by Starmaker Products, with whom we have an exclusive 2-year distribution arrangement. StarMaker Products is a joint effort between director and former Happy Days star Anson Williams and renowned Hollywood makeup artist JoAnna Connell. Among the products included in the line are PEARL Mist, an advanced anti-wrinkle moisturizing treatment, as well as Hollywood Hands, Overnight Sensation, and Pearlabrasion. · Hercules Hook, a uniquely designed hook for hanging items on walls, for which in August 2006, we entered into an exclusive three-year marketing and distribution rights agreement. We are utilizing direct response veteran Billy Mays as the spokesperson to market the Hercules Hook. · Extreme Beam™ - During 2005, Adsouth Partners internally developed and marketed this line of LED flashlights branded as the Extreme Beam Flashlight, which we acquired as part of our purchase of the consumer products assets of Adsouth Partners. We have successfully marketed Extreme Beam as a retail SKU (or Stock Keeping Unit, typically referring to a numeric or alpha-numeric system for tracking inventory with each product or part represented by a unique SKU number or code) · MyPlace™ – A portable, folding laptop computer table. · EZ Foldz – A patented folding step stool. · ZorbEEZ™ - a brand of super-absorbent, non-woven, chamois-like cloths for a wide variety of household uses. · Steam Buddy™ – A portable electric steamer used to take the wrinkles out of clothing, furniture and household fabrics. We continuously seek to develop or acquire rights to new or complementary products that have the attributes and meet the criteria that we believe are necessary to our business model. In evaluating new products, we focus on several factors including the potential market for the product, our ability to capture market share and/or expand that market, the extent to which we can use our transactional marketing advertising expertise to build the brand and create consumer demand, and whether the product would ultimately lend itself to mass-market retail distribution. Our focus over the past year has been on products that sell at retail prices of between $9.99 and $39.99, but our emphasis and our product portfolio changes over time in response to market conditions and opportunities. We periodically review our products to evaluate their ongoing marketability, and we may decide to discontinue any one or more products if we determine that we cannot prof itably continue to generate orders and or re-orders in the retail channel. Our licensing arrangements for products we market and sell but that are owned by third parties are typically structured as exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell the products in exchange for payment of a royalty. The royalty is generally calculated as a percentage of gross sales of the product, excluding shipping and handling charges, and net of various offsets such as returns, refunds, credits, allowances, chargebacks and the like. The amount of the royalty depends on various factors that include the stage of development of a product and associated marketing materials, the level of intellectual property protection or other barriers to competitive entry associated with a product, and historical sales of the product, if any. For products in early stages of development with little to no intellectual property protection, royalties would generally lower than for a product supported by patents and with demonstrated marketabilit y, such as historical sales or strong consumer response to existing marketing materials like a television commercial. We also generally pay lower royalties on direct to consumer sales than on wholesale sales, reflecting typically lower net margins on direct sales due to higher advertising costs associated with such sales. Royalties on direct to consumer sales are generally between 1% and 4% percent of adjusted gross revenues, and royalties on wholesale sales range from 4% to 12% of adjusted gross revenues. Our product license agreements also generally include sales or royalty milestones that must be achieved in order to maintain exclusivity and/or in order to extend the term of the license. The initial term of our product license agreements are typically 3 years with additional renewal terms upon achievement of applicable sales or royalty thresholds. For some products, we may act as exclusive distributor within defined territories (inclusive of the U.S.) or specified channels of distribution (e.g. mass market retail) with a corresponding license to use any associated intellectual property in connection with our marketing and sales efforts. Under these arrangements, the owner of the product is also typically the manufacturer who sells us the product at agreed-upon prices with volume discounts. As with license agreements, these distribution arrangements will 14 generally entitle us to be the exclusive marketer and seller of the product within the subject territory and/or channel so long as mutually agreeable sales milestones are achieved. Real Estate Segment. We own a forty-nine (49%) percent interest in Gateway Granby, LLC, a limited liability company that owns and operates an office building in East Granby, Connecticut. The office building contains approximately 52,000 square feet of rentable space and is located on 7.7 developable acres. We maintain control of Gateway Granby by virtue of an Irrevocable Proxy and Agreement dated November 29, 2005, under which another member of Gateway Granby owning an approximately 12% membership interest has granted us an irrevocable proxy to vote her interest on all matters on which Gateway Granby members are entitled to vote. Due to such voting control, Granbys financial results are consolidated with our financial results, and the minority voting interests are recorded separately. As of March 31, 2008, approximately 62% of the available office space is rented to tenants under multi-year leases. The remaining 38% of the East Granby Propertys rentable space is currently vacant. Marketing and Sales Consumer Products Segment Transactional Marketing. Transactional marketing, also commonly referred to as direct response marketing, is a $323 billion a year industry according to the Electronic Retailing Association, an industry trade group. The name derives from the nature of a transactional marketing advertisement, the airing or publication of which is intended to elicit an immediate response from, and interaction (or transaction) with, a customer. The hallmark of a transactional marketing advertisement is that, in addition to informing the consumer about the product, it typically includes a method, such as a toll-free telephone number or website address, through which a viewer of the ad can make a purchase. A televised, radio or telephonic transactional marketing advertisement would also typically include inducements, such as additional products, discounts or other promotions, intended to encourage a potential customer to respon d to the advertisement. There are three basic categories of transactional marketing product sales: The Basic Offer; Upsell Offers and Continuity Offers. The core product is the engine that drives the direct response transaction. Its features, benefits, advantages and uses, coupled with any bonus items that are included in the Basic Offer, prompt the customer to pick up the phone or click on the Internet ad. Upsell Offers are additional product sales opportunities, which are presented to the customer during the order-taking process. The goal is to increase the average revenue per sale through attractive Upsell Offers. Continuity Offers are also typically presented during the order-taking process and provide an opportunity for the customer to continue to receive additional quantities of the product or an Upsell product automatically on a periodic basis at an attractive price. The success or effectiveness of a transactional marketing campaign is usually measured in terms of the amount of product sales generated relative to the cost of the advertising media in which the advertisements ran. Because advertisements include product purchase information, the ability to track sales generated directly in response to the display of advertisements exists. This distinguishes transactional marketing from traditional brand advertising where there is not as direct a correlation between spending on advertising and realization of sales. Direct to consumer transactional marketing on television typically involves long form (infomercial) video productions or short-form (2-minute, 1-minute or 30-second) commercials. Companies who market their products through direct response television typically purchase commercial airtime from local broadcast stations and regional and national cable television operators across the country, either directly or through media buying agencies. Infomercial programs are most commonly run during late night and overnight time periods during the week and throughout the day on weekends. The availability of time periods for Infomercial messages and short form TV commercials varies from station to station, depending on their programming schedules. The majority of customer purchases occur within the first few hours following the airing of infomercial programs. We buy television media through a media-buying agency specializing in direct response placement. Under the terms of the non-exclusive agreement, the media-buying agency obtains, negotiates, arranges, purchases, and otherwise deals with all media placements on television. The media-buying agency is paid a variable commission rate tied to annual expenditures on media with the rates dependant upon whether we pay for the media in advance or the media-buying agency pays for the media and is reimbursed by us. Typically, the cost of media purchased through a media-buying agency is the same or less than the cost of media purchased directly from a television station or network as stations and networks provide a discount to media-buying agencies specifically to cover their commissions. As a result, we do not believe there are increased costs associated with using a media-buying agency to purchase our television media compared to purchasing the media di rectly. We out-source, through non-exclusive arrangements, call center operations, warehousing, order processing and fulfillment, and customer service to companies specializing in such functions. We pay fixed and variable fees based on the nature of the services performed. 15 We also purchase media on the Web directly or through agencies and the majority of orders come in via online systems, thus reducing call center expenditures. Our warehouse and fulfillment vendors also processes these orders. In addition, we create websites for each product that is actively marketed, with such sites hosted and maintained by third party web services providers. Continuity Sales. The life cycle and the economics of amply capitalized Continuity Offers are fundamentally different from that of a one-time product sale. Customers acquired through the marketing of the initial Basic Offer and who elect to participate in the Continuity Offer, will often elect to receive the automatic product shipments multiple times. There are two significant advantages in the continuity sales model. First is the elimination of two major cost elements media and telemarketing, which increases the margin in the sales of those products significantly. This is why we have focused on creating Continuity Offers in new product campaigns whenever possible. Of course, not all customers who buy the initial product sign up for continuity, or, even if they do sign up, they do not always stay on the program for multiple continuity cycles. Over time, with each continuity cycle, more an d more customers will drop-off. The steepest drop-offs occur on the first two cycles; the customers who make it to the third cycle typically very much enjoy the product, and will continue to stay on continuity for the longest periods of time. The other significant advantage is the longer we continue to offer the Continuity opportunity, the absolute numbers of people enrolled will increase, and the absolute numbers of people accepting each subsequent cycle will increase. Over time, this importantly impacts the margins and the profitability of the entire marketing program. In order to increase customer retention through each continuity cycle, we develop customer retention programs, which can include discounts, free offers, coupons, and other incentives for accepting subsequent continuity cycles. On a regular basis, retention rates are tracked and analyzed for each Continuity program. Retail Distribution . We market and sell our products to major retailers such as mass merchant, department store, drug store and similar chains. In marketing to these chains we seek to demonstrate that our products meet a consumer need, are priced in a manner that will allow the stores to generate sufficient sales to justify stocking the product and that we are able to provide consistency in our products and timely deliveries. Our top retailer customers include Wal-Mart, Bed Bath and Beyond, Target, Linens n Things, RiteAid and CVS Pharmacies. We seek to leverage the advertising dollars we spend on transactional marketing campaigns into retail distribution and other wholesale sales. The amount of money spent on advertising to build a product brand and create consumer awareness is an important factor in obtaining purchase orders from retail store buying departments, who view such advertising as a means of supporting in-store sales. By way of example, we believe that the popularity and success of our Hercules Hook product in the transactional marketing format has helped fuel wholesale sales to resellers, including retail stores. Resellers of the product have viewed the market acceptance achieved in our direct to consumer sales as an indication that the product is one that consumers want to buy at a price they find acceptable. This, combined with the brand and product awareness that happens when a product is advertised in a significant way, suggests to resellers that they too will be able t o profitably liquidate inventory of the product purchased from us on a wholesale basis. We also believe that one of the keys to maximizing sales of our products in the retail channels is the ability to obtain shelf space, and, whenever possible, obtain space for a display. Typically, displays are used for products which the retailer believes will generate high volume over a relatively short time. We have been able to place major displays for our Dermafresh and Starmaker lines in most major drug chains, and the Hercules Hook line of products with most of our retail accounts. We believe that the ability to place such displays in stores will help the stores to generate sufficient sales to justify product reorders or to place the products in other stores owned or operated by the retailer. A limited part of our marketing strategy entails selling products on a pay on scan basis to certain retailers, by which we provide the product to the retailer, but do not receive payment until the retailer sells the product. While this strategy has enabled us to obtain more shelf space in major retailers than we would otherwise be able to obtain in the past, we are not selling our most successful products to any retailer who requires a pay on scan relationship. Rather, we have chosen to supply those stores through third party distributors who pay upon shipment. The goal is to maintain retail sales volume and acceptable payment terms while avoiding some of the risks for returns or exposure to retail allowances. Only a small percentage of our products are currently sold on a pay on scan basis. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold approximately $110,000 of product on pay on scan terms, which represented 0.3% of total revenues. We maintain a network of independent contractors who analyze and facilitate our relationships with retail accounts and who, in return, are paid a commission on our sales of products to the accounts they represent. These commission arrangements are generally 5% of net sales taking into account returns, allowances and like offsets. International and Other Wholesale Distribution . International sales opportunities typically arise once a product has proven to be commercially successful in the US, at which time we might sell the product to an international distributor through non-exclusive agreements, which may be converted to an exclusive agreement if certain minimum sales targets are achieved. There are approximately 90 countries around the world that can show US infomercials. We sell our products to reputable international distributors, who then resell the products to sub-marketers who air the infomercials in the individual countries. We 16 will customarily provide the original infomercial or other marketing materials free of charge to the international companies, and profit from the non-returnable sale of the product. We also sell products to domestic downstream customers such as HSN, QVC, catalogues and others (such as credit card billing insert marketers). Real Estate Segment. Our marketing in our real estate activities is limited to working with real estate brokers in connection with leasing and/or sale of commercial office space. Competition Consumer Products Segment. Transactional Marketing. The transactional marketing industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and subject to constant change and intense marketing by providers of similar products. We expect that new competitors are likely to join existing competitors in this industry. There are many small, one-product transactional marketing companies. As the companies participating in this market are mostly privately held, reliable competitive financial information is not ordinarily available. The larger competitors are Guthy-Renker, Thane International, Inc., Sylmark, Inc., and Tristar Products, Inc. The other competitors are either single product companies or dependent solely on TV media sales that involve unpredictable up and down revenue years. All of the live shopping channels are either public companies or subsidiaries of public companies. There is a large and growing market for direct to consumer sales. This growth has been fueled importantly by the rise of the Internet and broadband connectivity which has made the Internet an always on household appliance. The volume of Online sales and advertising continues to rise on a yearly basis, and much of the sales and advertising on the Internet are transactional marketing offers. The rising cost of television time makes Television media buying a very important and competitive element. The ability to obtain television media at cost effective pricing levels is a critical focus of WWE. Additional competitive factors in the transactional marketing industry are the ability to license or develop successful products and to successfully build brands and brand awareness through marketing expertise. As online marketing becomes an increasing part of the transactional marketing equation, the ability to successfully develop and manage online campaigns will be an increasingly important competitive factor. Extending the lifetime value of the customer by providing effective customer service, database driven relational marketing campaigns and creative continuity programs are additional important competitive factors. Lastly, extending the lifecycle of the product introduction through effectively and successfully managing our retail distribution opportunities is a critical competitive factor in our overall business strategy. Retail Distribution. The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete with products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors, such as The Proctor & Gamble Company, Johnson & Johnson, and Revlon, Inc. Each product that we introduce potentially competes with products marketed by major manufacturers and distributors. Our success depends on our ability to support our products with advertising, including transactional marketing advertising, promotions and other vehicles to build awareness of our brands, and the efforts of our network of third party retail sales representatives in conjunction with our internal staff and sales management. We believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products and bringing them to the attention of retail store buyers. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important competitive factors. We believe that we gain a certain level of competitive advantage by utilizing cost savings from transactional marketing that provides us with a lower overall advertising cost to promote our products. In marketing our products we also compete with the major companies in seeking shelf space and in placing displays in prime locations within a store. The ability to obtain shelf space and to display our products in the stores is crucial to generating business, especially for products, such as ours, that are not as well known as the products which are manufactured and marketed by some of the largest product marketing companies in the world. After an initial order, retail outlets, especially mass marketing retailers, decide on whether and how much to order and where to display the product in the store based on their perception of the consumer response to the product. Thus, without good shelf space or displays for an initial order, it may be difficult for a new product to generate a favorable consumer response that in turn affects the willingness of the retailer to make further purchases. Real Estate Segment. The office building owned by Granby is, as of March 31, 2008, 62% occupied by unrelated tenants. Granby competes with many owners of office buildings in the Northern Hartford, Connecticut area for leasing and lease renewals. The general competitive conditions to which the East Granby Property is subject is high with respect to both leasing and sales. 17 Suppliers We do not manufacture any of our products. In general, our products are manufactured by third party suppliers, often in China, pursuant to purchase orders. We sometimes purchase products for which we have distribution rights from the party who granted us the rights or from its authorized manufacturers. Because some of our product volume is currently low, we may not always be able to take advantage of quantity pricing from those suppliers. To the extent that we are able to increase our volume of products significantly, we actively negotiate to reduce the cost of our products. Major Customers We sell to a high number of customers through transactional marketing without any significant customer concentration. Customers for our products in the retail distribution channel are generally mass merchandising retail companies, including some of the largest retailers in the United States. We are often subject to their policies on such matters as the time of delivery and payment as well as their cancellation and return policies. It may be necessary for us to accept less than favorable terms in some cases in order to generate the business. Our sales representatives and management regularly call on buyers at almost all major national retail chains and major catalog publishers. With regard to our real estate segment, we have two major tenants occupying approximately 62% of our rentable office space. These tenants have leases expiring in 2010 with options to extend for additional five-year terms. Intellectual Property When we obtain the exclusive licensing rights to a product developed by another, e.g., an inventor, the inventor will have ordinarily obtained the requisite trademark, trade dress, copyright, and patent protection for the product in the United States with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). To the extent that the inventor has not previously obtained such intellectual property protection, we would assist the person to secure such protection. If we develop a product internally, we secure, as applicable, trademark, trade dress, copyright, and patent protection for the product in the United States with the USPTO. We have many trademarks and we work with inside and outside counsel to create appropriate intellectual property protections. Our intellectual property, to the extent it is not subject to trademark, copyright or patent protection, is protected through use of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. To this e nd, we require each of our officers and employees to enter into confidentiality agreements. Our Intellectual Property includes product trademarks for SteamBuddy™, Zorbeez™, Wardrobe Wonder™, Perfect Youth™, Body Burner™, MyPlace™, Dermafresh™, E70®, Wrinkle Be Gone™, Extreme Beam™, Instant Eye Aid™, Mitsu™, and Vibra Ring™as well as a corporate trademark for Worldwide Excellence. Starmaker™ and Hercules Hook™ are each owned by their respective product developers; we were granted exclusive licenses to sell those products in defined territories. Employees As of March 31, 2008, we had a total of 27 full-time employees, which included 20 in Encino, California, 6 in Boca Raton, Florida, and 1 in New York. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe that we have satisfactory working relations with our employees. Our corporate offices are located in Encino, California. Government Regulation We, like others in the consumer products industry, are subject to various local, state, federal and international consumer protection laws. In particular, all transactional marketers, and all products that we sell, are subject to the requirements of the Federal Trade Commission Act, including the Acts provisions prohibiting deceptive practices in connection the advertising, marketing, and sale of consumer products. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a broad statutory mandate with respect to, among other products, foods, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics. The FDA seeks to insure that products under its purview are safe and are not mislabeled. For example, a product offering that is ingested by customers may be regulated by the FDA. We do not currently market or sell any products that we believe to be governed by FDA regulation. Our real estate business is in compliance with all environmental laws relating to hazardous substances in real property. Future compliance with environmental laws is not expected to have a material effect on its business. Properties East Granby, Connecticut We own a forty-nine (49%) percent interest in Gateway Granby, LLC (Granby) a limited liability company that owns and operates an office building in East Granby, Connecticut. The Granby property is currently being held for sale. The office building contains approximately 52,000 square feet of rentable space and is located on 7.7 developable acres. Under the first and second mortgages, the outstanding principle balance at December 31, 2007 was approximately $2.0 million and $1.1 million respectively. 18 We maintain control of Gateway Granby by virtue of an Irrevocable Proxy and Agreement dated November 29, 2005, under which another member of Gateway Granby owning an approximately 12% membership interest has granted us an irrevocable proxy to vote her interest on all matters on which Gateway Granby members are entitled to vote. Due to such voting control, Granbys financial results are consolidated with our financial results, and the minority voting interests are recorded separately.

The initial term expires December 31, 2010. (1) Approximately 38% of the East Granby Propertys rentable space is currently vacant. This rentable space has been subdivided into four smaller areas since the space was vacated by the prior tenant in 2005. Our main corporate office is located at 16000 Ventura Blvd., Suite 301, Encino, California 91436. This facility has approximately 7,400 rentable square feet. The lease term is 60 months ending in October 2011. Rent for the first year of the lease term is approximately $17,100 per month, with an increase of approximately $6,400 for each year of the term thereafter. We are subleasing our existing La Grange Avenue office space in Los Angeles, California for the remainder of that lease term which extends until February 2009. In addition, we lease approximately 1,600 square feet of office space in Boca Raton, Florida. The lease term ends in March, 2010. Rent for the lease term is approximately $2,500 per month. We utilize this office for our retail distribution business. These facilities are in good repair and we believe that these properties are adequately covered by insurance. In addition, we believe that our existing facilities will be adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. Should we need additional space, we believe we will be able to secure additional space at commercially reasonable rates. Our principal executive offices are located at 16000 Ventura Blvd., Suite 301, Encino, California 91436 and our telephone number is (818) 926-4900. Our home page on the Internet can be located at www.verticalbranding.com . LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we may be involved in litigation with customers, vendors, suppliers and others in the ordinary course of business. Any such existing proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we are a party to the proceedings discussed below. On March 27, 2007, Diversified Investors Capital Services of N.A., Inc. ("Diversified") instituted an action against Vertical Branding, Inc. and Worldwide Excellence, Inc. (WWE) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (County of New York) (Case No. 07-601008). Diversified alleges breach of a Management and Consulting Agreement entered into with WWE in May of 2005 (the Consulting Agreement), as well as a subsequent letter agreement with WWE dated October 23, 2005 (the Letter Agreement). The Consulting Agreement contemplates the provision by Diversified of merger and acquisition and finance-related services to WWE, with various payments contingent upon our acquisition of WWE and/or our raising at least $1.5 million in financing proceeds. The Letter Agreement similarly relates to fees to be paid to Diversified in connection with our sale of 10% Convertible Preferred Stock at or about the time of our acquisition of WWE. Diversified seeks monetary damages of approximately $617,000, of which $90,000 is alleged to be due as consulting fees under the Consulting Agreement, $233,000 is alleged to be due under the Letter Agreement as commissions in connection with our sale of preferred stock in November and December of 2005, and $288,750 is alleged to be due under the Letter Agreement as commission in connection with our sale of 10% convertible debentures in August and September 2006. Diversified also seeks the issuance, pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, of a warrant to purchase 200,000 shares of our common stock at $1 per share, and the issuance, pursuant to the Letter Agreement, of a warrant to purchase 107,500 of our preferred units. We and WWE dispute the validity of the subject agreements, our obligation to make payments in the amounts or kinds claimed, or at all, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter. Our position and defense is premised on, among other things, that fact that Diversified seeks compensation for services that were never performed nor for which the applicable agreements entitle Diversified to compensation, and that Diversified materially misrepresented, and failed disclose information about, its ability and qualifications with respect to the services to be performed. The litigation is presently in the discovery phase and no trial date has been set. 19 In March of 2004, Buckhead Marketing and Distribution LLC, PAP Systems LLC and Nancy Duitch individually, among others, entered into a voluntary consent order with the Federal Trade Commission arising out of the FTCs investigation into marketing claims made in connection with the Peel Away the Pounds Weight Loss System. The order contains no admission of wrongdoing and no finding of liability and was entered into for settlement purposes only. The Order is binding upon the corporate successors and assigns. The order also applies in certain instances to any business in which Nancy Duitch is an officer or director, or has a majority ownership interest in, directly or indirectly controls, or any other business in which Nancy Duitch is engaged in activity related to the marketing of any product, service or program that provides health benefits, including weight or inch loss or related benefits, or the marketing of a ny food, drug or cosmetic where certain claims are made, but only to the extent that such business acts in active concert or participation with Ms. Duitch. Ms. Duitch is a director, our Chief Executive Officer, and through the Duitch Family Trust, beneficially owns approximately 15.8% of our outstanding common stock. The order prohibits certain weight loss representations and requires that other specified weight loss, fat loss and similar claims made in future advertising and claims regarding the results of tests or studies be substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. This is generally consistent with the standard for substantiating claims currently required by the FTC for all weight loss and dietary supplement products. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Market Information Our common stock is traded on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol VBDG. The following table sets forth, for the calendar quarters indicated, the high and low bid prices per share of common stock, as reported on the OTC Bulletin Board. These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not represent actual transactions. Common Stock Quarter Ended High Bid Low Bid March 31, 2006 $2.20 $1.01 June 30, 2006 $1.50 $0.51 September 30, 2006 $0.80 $0.30 December 31, 2006 $0.80 $0.33 March 31, 2007 $1.21 $0.33 June 30, 2007 $0.95 $0.33 September 30, 2007 $0.75 $0.59 December 31, 2007 $0.85 $0.40 Holders As of March 31, 2008, there were approximately 530 holders of record of our common stock based upon the records maintained by our transfer agent. Transfer Agent and Registrar Our transfer agent is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company with an office located at 17 Battery Place, New York, New York 10004-1123 and whose phone number is (212) 509-4000. Dividend Policy We did not pay any cash dividends on our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, the results of operations, capital requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, the terms of our 10% convertible preferred stock restricts our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. The holders of the 10% convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative preferential dividends at the rate equal to 10% of the purchase price of the preferred stock payable semi-annually in arrears. The payments are in cash or, at our option, in shares of common stock. Payments are due May 29 and November 29 of each year. We may not pay any dividends on our common stock before all dividends are paid on the 10% convertible preferred stock. 20 Equity Compensation Plan Information The following table sets forth certain information, as of December 31, 2007, concerning shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the Companys existing equity compensation plans.

These options were issued to former Company directors pursuant to a non-employee director compensation policy and were not approved by shareholders. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS All statements contained herein that are not historical facts, including but not limited to, statements regarding future operations, financial condition and liquidity, future borrowing, capital requirements, and our future development and growth plans, are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking in nature and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the headings Risks Factors in this prospectus as well as those described in our reports filed and to be filed from time to time with the Commission. The discussion and analysis below is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and related Notes thereto. Overview We are a consumer products company selling high quality household, beauty and personal care products at affordable prices. In addition to our consumer products business, we operate a smaller, non-integrated business which entails the ownership and leasing of certain real estate holdings in Granby, Connecticut. Our model for successfully bringing the products that we develop or license to market typically begins with what we refer to as a transactional marketing campaign, which is intended to build product and brand awareness while at the same time generating sales. Our transactional marketing campaigns are conducted in as many channels of consumer media as are viable for generating immediate sales in response to our product advertisements, including television, print, radio and the Internet. 21 Our ultimate goal is to leverage product and brand awareness generated from transactional marketing into wholesale sales of our products to resellers, which include national retail and drugstore chains as well as home shopping channels, catalog publishers and international distributors. In addition, based on results achieved and relationships established through this channel, we have begun developing, licensing and selling products that are intended for retail distribution only, a trend we expect to continue into 2008. We currently have products placed with many of the nations largest retail outlets, including WalMart, Target, Costco and Bed Bath and Beyond, as well the nations major drug chains such as CVS, Walgreens and RiteAid. Our financial results are presented in two segments: consumer products and real estate. Beginning with our acquisition of Worldwide Excellence (WWE) in November 2005 (at which time our historical results of operation became those of WWE), and continuing through July 2006, we reported results in a direct response (or transactional) marketing segment and a real estate segment. With our acquisition of the assets of the consumer products business of Adsouth Partners, Inc. in August 2006, including the retail distribution relationships and network we acquired, we began reporting a third segment styled retail distribution. Due to changes in the way we viewed and used transactional marketing in the latter part of 2007 and going forward, we made the decision to present transactional marketing and retail distribution as a comprehensive consumer products segment. This change arose from developments in our business and the marketplace in which we operate. We believe that our transactional marketing efforts support sales in our other channels of distribution, operating synergistically as opposed to independently. Furthermore, increasing costs of television media have made it more and more difficult to conduct profitable transactional marketing campaigns, causing us to concentrate on further developing wholesale channels of distribution where we experience lower gross margins but higher net margins. For this and other reasons, our wholesale sales, in particular to our retail store accounts, have become an increasing percentage of overall sales, which we expect wil l continue in 2008. Direct sales to consumers through transactional marketing remains a significant source of revenue as well as a very important part of our business strategy, but one that we increasingly view more as a method of advertising our consumer products generally as opposed to a stand-alone segment. In 2007, we experienced significant revenue growth, driven largely by the roll-out of new products and increased distribution to retailers. Our strategy for continued sales growth in 2008 includes the introduction of 4-6 new products in categories suitable for distribution to most of our existing retail customers as well to new major retail outlets such as office supply stores. In addition, our focus in the latter part of 2007, continuing in 2008, is on products with retail price points between $9.99 and $39.99, which we believe to be better positioned than higher price point products in the current economic environment. Finally, as we continue to pursue new channels of distribution, we expect growth in international and home shopping sales. We generated a modest amount of net income through the nine months ended September 30, 2007, but due to various factors affecting fourth quarter sales, expenses and other items, we ended fiscal year 2007 with a net loss of $3.4 million. Among the non-recurring factors contributing to a fourth quarter 2007 net loss of $3.7 million were increased costs associated with the bankruptcy of one of our former warehouse and fulfillment vendors, a reserve taken against our deferred tax assets, and the write-down of certain assets acquired from Adsouth Partners in August 2006. Components of Revenue and Gross Profit Sources of Revenue Consumer Products Segment In fiscal year 2007, we principally marketed and sold twelve (12) products under five (5) product lines, of which we own two (2) product lines (comprising 5 products) and have exclusive licenses or distribution rights to three (3) product lines (comprising 7 products). Most of these products are beauty and household products. The following is a list of the product lines for which we had significant sales: · StarMaker Beauty Line, which is comprised of various beauty products used in the entertainment industry and developed by Starmaker Products, with whom we have an exclusive 2-year distribution arrangement. StarMaker Products is a joint effort between director and former Happy Days star Anson Williams and renowned Hollywood makeup artist JoAnna Connell. Among the products included in the line are PEARL Mist, an advanced anti-wrinkle moisturizing treatment, as well as Hollywood Hands, Overnight Sensation, and Pearlabrasion. · Hercules Hook, a uniquely designed hook for hanging items on walls, for which in August 2006, we entered into an exclusive three-year marketing and distribution rights agreement. We are utilizing direct response veteran Billy Mays as the spokesperson to market the Hercules Hook. · Extreme Beam™ - During 2005, Adsouth Partners internally developed and marketed this line of LED flashlights branded as the “Extreme Beam Flashlight,” which we acquired as part of our purchase of the consumer products assets of Adsouth Partners. · EZ Foldz – A patented folding step stool. 22 · ZorbEEZ™ - a brand of super-absorbent, non-woven, chamois-like cloths for a wide variety of household uses. Real Estate Segment We own a forty-nine (49%) percent interest in Gateway Granby, LLC (“Granby”) that owns and operates an office building in East Granby, Connecticut. Revenue primarily consists of rental income from two tenants who occupy 62% of the office building, and in 2006, the sale of property. Costs of Goods Sold Consumer Products Cost of goods sold for direct to consumer products sales consists primarily of (1) the landed costs of the finished goods received from third-party manufacturing partners, (2) fees to out-sourced call and fulfillment centers, which includes order processing, shipping and storage charges, and freight charges for shipping to customers, (3) royalties paid to the inventors or other licensors of products, and (4) credit card processing fees. Real Estate All real estate assets were acquired in connection with the reverse merger acquisition in November 2005. Cost of sales consists of the carrying costs of property sold. Components of Operating Expenses Selling Expenses Consumer Products Selling expenses are the largest component of our cost structure and primarily consist of media expenditures and out-sourced infomercial production costs. The largest component of selling expenses is the cost of TV and Internet media. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist of corporate expenses (see discussion below), administrative employment costs and executive salaries, liability insurance, legal fees and settlements, occupancy, telecommunications costs, and the cost of operating the office building that we own in East Granby, Connecticut. Corporate expenses primarily consist of the direct costs of being a public company and the costs attributable to new business development. We expect that corporate expenses will increase as additional senior management personnel are hired to oversee our anticipated growth and to comply with the requirements of being a public company. Depreciation and amortization The significant components of depreciation and amortization include: (i) amortization of deferred finance costs related to the 10% secured convertible notes, which closed in August, 2006, (ii) amortization of the intangible assets associated with the Retail Distribution business acquired in August 2006, and (iii) depreciation expense related to the office building that we own and operate in East Granby, Connecticut. Other Charges We incurred additional costs arising out of the bankruptcy of one of our third party warehouse and fulfillment vendors. These are costs in excess of normal business expenditures. Other charges also include the write-down of acquired accounts receivable and inventory that were included in the assets of the consumer products business that we purchased from Adsouth Partners in August 2006. Components of Other Items Interest Expense, net We pay interest on various debt for working capital purposes and on mortgages in our real estate operations. Minority Voting Interest in Net Income of Subsidiary 23 We own a forty-nine (49%) percent interest in Gateway Granby, LLC (Granby) which owns and operates an office building in East Granby, Connecticut. Simultaneous to the closing of the WWE acquisition in November 2005, we entered into an irrevocable proxy and agreement with certain members of Granby who are also stockholders of VBI, which agreement gives us voting and operational control of Granby so long as we maintain our 49% ownership interest. Due to such voting control, Granby is included in our consolidated financial statements and the minority voting interests (51%) are recorded separately. Discontinued Operations The remaining receivables from our former medical financing business, conducted through various subsidiaries, were included in the net assets at the time of the WWE acquisition. We sold our continuing service obligations related to these receivables and the future revenue rights of our medical financing business in exchange for preferential collection rates on the receivables that are expected to be collected. Off-Balance Sheet Transactions We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies Management's discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management believes that the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are intangible assets, stock-based compensation, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment against goodwill, deferred tax assets, and revenue recognition. Intangible Assets The total cost of the retail distribution business acquired on August 1, 2006 in excess of net assets acquired was $2 million, which was allocated to an intangible asset, recognizing the value of the 18,000 retail store distribution network. The intangible asset is being amortized over ten years, the estimated life of the current retail store distribution network. Stock-Based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123(R), "Stock-Based Payment" ("FAS 123(R)"). FAS 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and amends FAS No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." Generally, the approach in FAS 123(R) is similar to the approach described in FAS 123. FAS 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. This statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. FAS 123(R) requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed. The process of estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards and recognizing stock-based compensation cost over their requisite service period involves significant assumptions and judgments. We estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-valuation model which requires that we make certain assumptions regarding: (i) the expected volatility in the market price of our common stock; (ii) dividend yield; (iii) risk-free interest rates; and (iv) the period of time employees are expected to hold the award prior to exercise (referred to as the expected holding period). In addition, SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the expected impact of forfeited awards and recognize stock-based compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest. If actual forfeiture rates differ materially from our estimates, stock-based compensation expense could differ significantly fro m the amounts we have recorded in the current period. We periodically review actual forfeiture experience and revise our estimates, as necessary. We recognize the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated forfeiture rate as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the revision. As a result, if we revise our assumptions and estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could change materially in the future. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts involve estimates based on managements judgment, review of individual receivables and analysis of historical bad debts. We monitor collections and payments from our customers and we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required. 24 Goodwill Goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the net assets acquired in connection with: (i) the reverse merger on November 29, 2005 Merger Goodwill, and (ii) the acquisition of the Retail Distribution business acquired on August 1, 2006 Retail Distribution Goodwill. The excess of the costs over the assets acquired in connection with the reverse merger on November 29, 2005 are related to the benefits WWE derived from VBI being a publicly traded company with operations, assets and history. These benefits include the ability to use publicly traded equity for financing, acquisitions and the use of stock-based compensation. The excess of the costs over the net assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of the Retail Distribution business acquired on August 1, 2006 is a result of our final determination, during the quarter ended September 30, 2007, of the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Adsouth Partner s, Inc. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and will be tested more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value. When factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated for possible impairment, we compare the estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows produced by WWE and subsequent acquisitions financed by equity or convertible debt compared to the carrying value of goodwill to determine if an impairment loss should be recognized. Deferred Tax Assets Income taxes are accounted for using a balance sheet approach in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). We account for deferred income taxes by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the date of the balance sheet to differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. In determining the appropriate valuation allowance, we consider projected realization of tax benefits, book and taxable income trends, available tax strategies and the overall deferred tax position. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when the product is shipped or picked up by the customer. Provisions for discounts to customers, estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the sales are recorded. The return estimates are based on historical records. The full accrual method is used on the sale of real estate if the profit is determinable, we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit, and there is no continuing involvement with the property. If the buyer's initial and continuing investments are inadequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property, the installment method is used, resulting in the deferral of income. If we have continuing involvement with the property, the financing method is used. Effects of New Accounting Pronouncements In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments - An Amendment of FASB No. 133 and 140. The purpose of SFAS statement No. 155 is to simplify the accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments by permitting fair value re-measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. SFAS No. 155 also eliminates the restriction on passive derivative instruments that a qualifying special-purpose entity may hold. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of any entity's first fiscal year beginning after September 15, 2006. The adoption of FAS 155 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy as defined in the standard. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding financial instruments in one of the categories (level 3), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of FAS 157 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides a guidance on de-recognition, classification interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 25 In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of SFAS No. 115: (SFAS No. 159). The new statement allows entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. If a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item, changes in that items fair value in subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in current earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of SFAS No. 159 on our financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, this statement revises and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB also issued Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, this statement revise and converge internationally the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. We are currently evaluating the effects, if any, that FASB No. 160 may have on our financial statements; however, since we have significant noncontrolling interest (i.e. minority interest), this standard could materially affect the presentation and disclosure of the noncontrolling interest, which may affect certain performance and equity ratios. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to year ended December 31, 2006 On August 1, 2006, we acquired certain assets from Adsouth Partners, Inc. comprising Adsouth's consumer products division and assumed certain liabilities. We purchased rights to various consumer products and brands as well as succession to Adsouths wholesale and retail distribution channels and relationships. As a result of this acquisition, we commenced operations of our retail distribution business, which is included within our consumer product segment. Revenues and Gross Profit Consumer Products The following table summarizes our changes in net revenue and gross profit from the sale of consumer products (in thousands) for the periods indicated: Year ended December 31, Change 2007 2006 $ % Net revenue $ 35,658 $ 21,504 $ 14,154 66 % Cost of sales 16,509 8,797 7,712 88 % Gross profit $ 19,149 $ 12,707 $ 6,442 51 % Gross profit % 54% 59% Net Revenue Net revenue from consumer product sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 (2007) was approximately $35.7 million, an increase of $14.2 million, or 66%, compared to net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 (2006) of approximately $21.5 million. The increase in revenues during 2007 was attributable to: (i) a full year of revenue from customers in our retail distribution channel in 2007 compared to only five months of revenue in 2006, and (ii) the average revenue from customers in our retail distribution channel increased from $1.0 million per month in 2006 to $1.7 million per month in 2007. We utilized funds from the two stage financing that was closed in August and September 2006 for media advertising and inventory purchases, allowing us to launch marketing campaigns for new products during 2006, which carried over into 2007. In 2007, we were able to leverage our advertising on transactional marketing campaigns into retail dis tribution and other wholesale sales. Gross Profit Gross profit in 2007 was approximately $19.1 million, which represents an increase of $6.4 million, or 51%, compared to gross profit in 2006 of approximately $12.7 million. The gross profit margin was 54% in 2007, compared to 59% in 2006. The decrease in gross profit margin in 2007 compared to 2006 was due to an increase in the mix of revenues from our retail distribution customers, which inherently carry a lower gross margin. In addition, due the bankruptcy of one of our third party fulfillment centers, we incurred higher fulfillment costs beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007 when our new fulfillment center initially charged us higher rates. 26 Real Estate Revenue in 2007 was $0.7 million, a decrease of $0.9 million, compared to revenue in 2006 of approximately $1.6 million. The decrease in revenues in 2007 was due to $0.9 million of revenue that was included in 2006 from the sale of the 65 acre parcel in Hunter, New York. The remainder of the revenue in 2006 and all of the revenue in 2007 was primarily rental income from the office building in East Granby, Connecticut. The cost of the 65 acre parcel was $900,000, and was included in cost of sales and thus adversely impacted our 2006 gross margin.. The following table summarizes our changes in costs and expenses from continuing operations (in thousands) for the periods indicated: Year ended December 31, Change 2007 2006 $ % Selling 11,982 10,732 1,250 12 % General and administrative: Consumer products 3,927 2,351 1,576 67 % Real estate 408 418 (10) (2) % Corporate expenses 2,501 1,366 1,135 83 % Total general and administrative 6,836 4,135 2,701 Depreciation and amortization 1,240 561 679 121 % Other charges 1,052 - 1,052 Interest expense, net 1,228 614 614 100 % Selling Expenses Consumer Products Selling expenses in 2007 were approximately $12.0 million, an increase of $1.3 million, or 12%, compared to selling expenses in 2006 of approximately $10.7 million. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to there being a full year of selling expenses related to our retail distribution sales channel, compared to only five months of selling expenses in 2006. Selling expense as a percent of revenue decreased to 34% in 2007 as compared to 50% in 2006. The lower cost as a percent of revenue in 2007 as compared to 2006 was due to leveraging the advertising dollars we spend on transactional marketing campaigns into retail distribution and other wholesale sales as well as economies of scale associated with increased sales. The primary component of selling expense is the cost of media advertising, which consists of TV, Internet and print. The following table summarizes our changes in media expenses for the periods indicated: Year ended December 31, Change 2007 2006 $ % Media: TV $ 8,014 $ 7,692 $ 322 4 % Internet 876 1,475 (599) (41) % Print 174 97 77 79 % Total media $ 9,064 $ 9,264 $ (200) TV Media: TV media expense in 2007 was approximately $8.0 million, which represents an increase of $0.3 million, compared to TV media expenses in 2006. The net increase in 2007 was due to the launch of our Zorbeez product in 2007, offset by a reduction in spending on the products that were eliminated in 2006. We monitor our TV media spending in relation to consumer acceptance of the product and their willingness to purchase it from our retail distribution customers. In addition to the differences in the amount of TV media time that we purchased, our media costs were also affected by an increase in media rates charged by TV stations in 2007 compared to 2006. Internet Media: Internet media expense in 2007 was approximately $0.9 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, compared to internet media expenses in 2006. The decrease in 2007 was attributable to a $1.0 million decrease of internet media for the beauty product line. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in internet media expenditures in 2007 of $.5 million on the existing line of Hercules Hooks and the new Zorbeez product line. 27 General and Administrative Expenses Consumer Products General and administrative expenses in 2007 were approximately $3.9 million, an increase of $1.6 million, or 67%, compared to general and administrative expenses in 2006 of approximately $2.3 million. The increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 was due having only five months of expenses associated with our retail distribution sales, which was a business we acquired in August 2006, compared to a full year of expenses in 2007. In addition occupancy costs increased in 2007 due to our relocation to a larger facility in October 2006. Corporate Expenses Corporate expenses in 2007 were approximately $2.5 million, an increase of $1.1, or 80%, compared to corporate expenses in 2006 of approximately $1.4 million. Corporate expenses consist primarily of the costs of being a public company and the costs attributable to new business development. The increase in corporate expenses from 2007 as compared to 2006 consists of an additional: (i) $150,000 of allocated employment costs of executive officers and other employees whose services are directly related to the management of the public company and new business development, (ii) $300,000 of professional fees including $153,000 of Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs, (iii) $232,000 of investor relations costs and (iv) $359,000 of non-cash stock-based compensation. Depreciation and Amortization The total cost of the retail distribution network, in excess of the net assets acquired was $2.0 million, which is amortized over the estimated life of ten years. Amortization expense of the retail distribution network was approximately $0.2 million in 2007 and $0.1 million in 2006 (five months). Amortization of financing costs increased by $0.1 million in 2007 as result of the BFI line of credit that commenced in June 2007. On August 2, 2006, we began amortizing the costs incurred to obtain the $5.7 million 10% secured convertible notes over the 36 month life of the loan. Amortization expense was $0.5 million in 2007 and $0.2 million in 2006. Other Charges Other charges were approximately $1.1 million in 2007, compared to none in 2006. We incurred costs in excess of normal operating expenses of $0.7 million in 2007 arising out of the bankruptcy of one of our third party warehouse and fulfillment centers. Among these costs are duplicate shipping charges, processing fees for returns and cancellations, increased customer service costs, costs to ship inventory to new facilities, and the costs to receive the product at the new facilities. These costs are being reported as a separate component of Costs and Expenses. We have retained legal counsel to recoup these costs, or some portion thereof, in the bankruptcy proceeding, although no assurance can be given as to the timing or amount of any such recovery. In addition, we determined subsequent to the twelve month period following the consummation of the acquisition of assets from Adouth Partners that the changing value of certain assets acquired, principally accounts receivable and inventory, were in excess of their fair value. Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes a $0.4 million write-down of these assets. Interest Expense Interest expense in 2007 was $1.2 million, compared to interest expense of $0.6 million in 2006. The $0.6 million increase in interest expense was due to an increase in average debt outstanding in 2007, which was required to fund both the working capital needed to finance our growth and the acquisition of the retail distribution network in August 2006. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $1.0 million in 2007 compared to $0.1 million in 2006. The increase in 2007 was due to a $1.0 million increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on the criteria contained in FAS 109 of the realizability of these deferred tax assets. Notwithstanding managements view of future profitability, in determining whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary, forecasts of future taxable income are generally not considered sufficient evidence to outweigh a history of losses. 28 Liquidity and Capital Resources The conduct of our business requires access to sufficient capital to cover the costs of product development, production of marketing materials, the purchase of transactional advertising media (such as television, Internet, print and radio), and the purchase of product inventory. While a large component of our spending is often on advertising media, the terms we receive and the relatively quick return on that investment in the form of product sales associated with those expenditures does not typically result in liquidity constraints. The liquidity constraints associated with the purchase of advertising media occurs when we promote a new product and we do not have sufficient inventory on hand to ship and cover the cost of the related media. Our biggest capital commitment is the purchase of inventory for sales to our retail chain customers. In June 2007, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the BFI Agreement) with BFI Business Finance (Lender). Pursuant to the BFI Agreement, Lender will loan us up to the lesser of (i) $5,000,000 or (ii) the Borrowing Base. The Borrowing Base is defined as (i) 85% of the gross face amount of the eligible accounts receivable of our Adsouth Marketing, LLC subsidiary (ASM), plus (ii) 30% of the current market cost of raw materials and finished goods that constitute ASMs eligible inventory, not to exceed the lesser of $700,000 or 50% of the eligible accounts receivable borrowing base. We have guaranteed ASMs obligations under the BFI Agreement pursuant to the General Continuing Guaranty executed by us in favor of Lender on June 4, 2007 (the Guaranty). As of December 31, 2007, the balance of the line of credit was $1.7 million, which was the maximum amount availab le under the Borrowing Base. Loans extended pursuant to the BFI Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum of 2.0% above the greater of (i) the prime rate as reported in the western edition of the Wall Street Journal from time to time or (ii) 6.5%. Interest is payable monthly in arrears and we are required to pay at least $7,500 a month in interest regardless of the amounts outstanding under the BFI Agreement at any particular time. We are required to pay an annual loan fee equal to 1% of the maximum amount of the credit line. The BFI Agreement has an initial term of 12 months (the Basic Term) and thereafter shall automatically renew for successive 12 months periods (each a Renewal Term) so long as neither we nor Lender delivers written notice of its intention to terminate the BFI Agreement. We received an initial advance in June 2007 in the amount of $0.8 million upon the execution of the BFI Agreement (the Initial Loan). The proceeds of the Initial Loan were used to payoff obligations owed to Marquette Commercial Finance under a previous factoring agreement which was simultaneously terminated, as well as to pay fees associated with the close of the BFI Agreement. On November 13, 2007, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the SPA) pursuant to which we sold (i) 6,666,667 shares of Company common stock, $.001 par value, and (ii) five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,666,667 additional shares of common stock (one-half exercisable at $1.00 per share and one-half exercisable at $1.50 per share), for a total purchase price of $4 million. Simultaneously with the execution of the SPA, we also entered into an Agreement re Redemption of Convertible Notes (the Redemption Agreement) with the holders (the Holders) of our senior secured convertible notes sold in August and September 2006 in the original aggregate principal amount of approximately $5.8 million (the Notes). Pursuant to the terms of the Redemption Agreement, we paid to the Holders approximately $2.1 million representing pre-payment of principal installments through July 31, 2008, thus reducing the outstanding principal balance on the Notes to approximately $2.7 million. On December 31, 2007, we had working capital of $0.9 million. Based on our anticipated growth, we believe that our cash requirements will increase. To meet these needs, we entered into an asset based line of credit agreement in June 2007 and entered into a securities purchase agreement in November 2007, as described above. Subject to approval by our lender, we may fund additional growth by increasing the credit line on our asset based lending line of credit by using our receivables and inventory as collateral. We believe that our present cash resources, the turn-over of our existing receivables and inventory, cash available from the asset based line of credit and factoring agreement, and issuance of additional common stock for services will be sufficient over the next 12 months to fund our two operating business segments and discontinued operations, our company-wide working capital needs, and our expected investments in property and equipment. Net cash used by operations in 2007 was $2.3 million, as compared to $3.3 million used in 2006. The $1.0 million decrease in cash used by operations in 2007 was due to cash provided by: (i) an increase in earnings of $1.8 million, net of adjustments for non-cash-items of $2.5 million, (ii) an inventory increase in 2007 of $0.9 million compared to an increase of $1.3 million in 2006, and (iii) a decrease in prepaid expenses and deposits of $.6 million in 2007, compared to an increase of $1.1 million in 2006. Cash provided by operations was offset by the use of cash from: (i) the proceeds from the sale of real estate of $0.9 million in 2006, compared to none in 2007, (ii) an increase in spending on infomercials in 2007 of $0.6 million, and (iii) an increase in accounts payable of $0.1 million in 2007, compared to an increase of $1.5 million in 2006 29 Cash used by investing activities was $0.3 million in both 2007 and 2006 periods. An increase in capital expenditures in 2007 were offset by a decrease in the acquisition costs of the retail distribution network. Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.5 million in 2007 as compared to $3.4 million provided in 2006. The $0.9 million decrease in 2007 was primarily due to $1.8 million of net principal reductions in 2007 compared to $5.2 million of net borrowings in 2006. The net principal reductions in 2007 was a result of our $2.1 million prepayment of 10% convertible debt financed by the sale of additional common shares in November 2007. The net borrowings in 2006 was a result of proceeds received from the 10% convertible debt financing in August 2006 and second mortgage financing in July 2006. The decrease in net borrowings in 2007 was offset by: (i) the $4.0 million we received from the proceeds of the private placement that closed in November 2007, (ii) the payment of $0.6 million owed to us under our factoring agreements, and (iii) a $0.7 million reduction in the amount distributed to/contributed from the minority voting interest of our Gateway Granby, LLC subsidiary.

Employment Agreements Chief Executive Officer: Nancy Duitchs employment agreement with the Company (the Duitch Employment Agreement) was for a term of three years that ended March 31, 2008. As in effect for 2007, the Duitch Employment Agreement provides for an annual base salary of $250,000, with an annual upward adjustment of ten (10%) percent that Ms. Duitch waived for fiscal year 2006 and that resulted in a base salary of 275,000 for fiscal 2007. In addition, the Duitch Employment Agreement provides for a performance bonus based on the Company exceeding the following EBITDA targets: $2 million in fiscal 2005; $2.2 million in fiscal 2006; and $2.5 million in fiscal 2007. In July 2007, we and Ms. Duitch entered into an amendment to the Duitch Employment Agreement (the Amendment) changing the 2007 EBITDA target to an amount to be determined by the board of directors, and which the board set at $3.2 million. In consideration of her entry into the Amendment, th e Company agreed to pay Ms. Duitch $60,000, such amount to be paid at the time of payment of the CEO/President annual performance bonuses for 2007, if any. The Duitch Employment Agreement further provides for a monthly car allowance of $1,000 and health, medical and other benefits as adopted by the Companys Board of Directors from time to time. In addition, the Duitch Employment agreement includes customary provisions concerning ownership of intellectual property and non-disclosure obligations, but does not include any post-employment non-compete. While the Duitch Agreement also includes various termination and severance provisions, those provisions are no longer in effect in light of termination of the agreement. Ms. Duitch remains employed by the Company on at-will basis at the salary and with the benefits in effect as of the date of termination of her employment agreement and pending negotiation and entry into a successor agreement. President and Chief Operating Officer: On July 15, 2006, we entered into an employment agreement with Alan Gerson (the Gerson Employment Agreement), subject to the approval of the board of directors. The Gerson Employment Agreement was approved by the board of directors on July 18, 2006, and Mr. Gerson was appointed as President and Chief Operating Officer. On March 15, 2008, we and Mr. Gerson entered into a separation agreement and release (the Separation Agreement) superseding Mr. Gersons employment agreement and pursuant to which Mr. Gerson resigned as an officer and director of the Company. The terms of the Separation Agreement are described below. As in effect for 2007, the Gerson Employment Agreement provides for an annual base salary of $250,000, subject to annual increase by the board of directors during the term based on annual performance reviews. The Gerson Employment Agreement also provides for a performance bonus based on our achievement of certain EBITDA targets, which our board of directors set at $3.2 million for 2007. The Gerson Employment Agreement further provides for a monthly car allowance of $1,000 and health, medical and other benefits as adopted by the Companys Board of Directors from time to time. In addition, the Gerson 34 Employment agreement includes customary provisions concerning ownership of intellectual property and non-disclosure obligations, but does not include any post-employment non-compete. Pursuant to the terms of the Gerson Employment Agreement, Mr. Gerson received, as an inducement for his accepting the position of President and Chief Operating Officer, an option to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of our common stock, with the right to purchase 200,000 shares underlying the option vesting immediately and the remainder vesting ratably over a 30-month period (the July 2006 Option). The exercise price of the July 2006 Option is $0.52 and the option is exercisable for a period of five years from the date of grant. Mr. Gerson was also eligible, under his annual bonus plan, to receive grants of options to purchase up to 1,000,000 additional shares at then current market prices subject to achievement of annual performance goals as determined by the board of directors. On March 16, 2007, Mr. Gerson received an option to purchase an additional 200,000 share of Company common stock at $1.05 per share (the Mar ch 2007 Option). On July 10, 2007, we and Mr. Gerson entered into an amendment to the Gerson Employment Agreement (the Amendment) restructuring the long-term equity incentive component of Mr. Gersons compensation package. Under the terms of the Amendment, in lieu of any additional future option grants, we issued Mr. Gerson a performance (restricted) stock award in the amount of 444,000 shares vesting in three (3) equal installments upon the Companys achievement of specified EBITDA, market capitalization and/or fair market value of Company common stock milestones (the July 2007 RSA). The Gerson Employment Agreement provides for termination: (i) upon the expiration of three years, (ii) for justifiable cause, (iii) in the event of death or disability, or (iv) upon 60 days written notice of voluntary resignation. The Gerson Employment Agreement further provides that, (i) upon the voluntary resignation of Mr. Gerson with Good Cause, (ii) his termination by us without Justifiable Cause, or (iii) upon termination due to death or Disability (all as defined in the Gerson Employment Agreement), Mr. Gerson shall be entitled to: (i) A lump sum payment of his base salary for a period of six months; (ii) Any base salary and bonus (prorating the portion of the bonus for the year through the date of termination) accrued prior to the date of termination; (iii) Any amounts payable for compensation, accrued vacation, benefits and reimbursements owed and accrued through the date of termination; and (iv) Continuation of health and other benefits in effect as of the date of termination for a period of 180 days. As mentioned above, in March 2008 we entered into the Separation Agreement with Mr. Gerson, which superseded the Gerson Employment Agreement and pursuant to which Mr. Gerson resigned as an officer and director of the Company. The Separation Agreement provides for severance payments to Mr. Gerson equivalent to seven months of salary and benefits payable over seven months in equal semi-monthly installments. In addition, the right to purchase 250,000 shares underlying the July 2006 Option, and 5,555 shares underlying the March 2007 Option, accelerated and vested as of Mr. Gersons termination date, and the post-termination period of exercisability of the March 2007 Option was extended to July 18, 2011. The July 2007 RSA remained unvested and the underlying the shares were cancelled. Director Compensation In July 2006, our Board approved a compensation plan for non-employee directors (the 2006 DCP) that was in effect for fiscal year 2007. The 2006 DCP includes both equity and cash compensation and replaced all prior director compensation arrangements. Equity Awards : Under the 2006 DCP, upon joining the Board each non-employee director owning less than 5% of our outstanding common stock is granted (i) two stock options enabling the purchase, at market price on the date of grant, of up to a total of 39,000 shares of Company common stock,, and (ii) a restricted stock award in the amount of 7,500 shares. The right to purchase 10,000 shares underlying one of the stock options, in the total amount of 30,000 shares, vests immediately, with the balance of such stock option (i.e. the right to purchase 20,000 shares) vesting at the rate of 2,500 shares per quarter beginning at the end of the first quarter following the first anniversary of joining the Board. The other stock option, in the amount of 9,000 underlying shares, and the restricted stock award in the amount of 7,500 shares, each vest quarterly over a period of 3 years. All equity compensation awards provided f or by the 2006 DCP are made under, pursuant to and are governed by our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan.

Change in Control The Company is not aware of any arrangements including any pledge by any person of securities of the Company, the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of the registrant. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS Described below are certain transactions or series of transactions between us and our executive officers, directors and the beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock, on an as converted basis, and certain persons affiliated with or related to these persons, including family members, in which they had or will have a direct or indirect material interest in an amount that exceeds the lesser 37 of$120,000 or 1% of the average of our total assets as of year-end for the last two completed fiscal years, other than compensation arrangements that are otherwise required to be described under Executive Compensation. At various dates from June 2006 through August 2006, Nancy Duitch, who is a director, our Chief Executive Officer, and a shareholder, loaned the Company a total of $94,000. The loan was repaid at various times, until it was paid in full on August 7, 2006, with interest at the rate of 9% per annum. Total interest on the loan was $1,332. Our management believes that the terms of the loans were as fair as could have been obtained from an unaffiliated party in an arms length transaction. In November of 2006, our subsidiary, Adsouth Marketing, LLC (ASM), entered into an account transfer and purchase agreement with a receivables factoring company. Under the arrangement, ASM could sell qualified receivables to the factoring company up to a maximum outstanding balance of $2,000,000. Advances paid by the factoring company to ASM under the account transfer and purchase agreement were guaranteed by the Company, our Chief Executive Officer, Nancy Duitch, and by our former President and Chief Operating Officer, Alan Gerson. Ms. Duitch is also a director and a shareholder of VBI. Mr Gerson is a former director and holds options to purchase up to approximately 1,000,000 shares of our common stock. We agreed to indemnify Ms. Duitch and Mr. Gerson for any loss they may sustain in connection with their guaranty of the factor arrangement. In addition, we paid guarantor $50,000, or is 2.5% of the facility amount , in January 2007. The guaranty fee was being amortized over the two year term of the factoring agreement until the agreement was cancelled in 2007. Our management believes that terms of the guaranties were as fair as could have been obtained from an unaffiliated party in an arms length transaction. Under a Contract of Sale dated as of November 23, 2005, our subsidiary Yolo Equities Corp. (Yolo) agreed to sell a 65 acre parcel of undeveloped real estate in Hunter, New York to Mountaintrail at Hunter, LLC, a New York limited liability company (Mountaintrail) for $900,000. Mountaintrail is owned: (a) 51.67% by Yolo at Hunter, LLC, a New York limited liability company (YoloH), (b) 35.00% by Trailside Inroads, LLC, a New York limited liability company (Trailside) (100% owned by Lester Tanner (the former Chairman, President, and CEO of the Company and the President of Yolo through April 19, 2006, and one of our stockholders) and his affiliates), and (c) 13.33% by Lester Tanner and affiliates. The selling price of $900,000 was paid to Yolo as follows: (a) $380,000 from Mountaintrail, and (b) the receipt by Yolo of a 51.67% membership interest in Mountaintrail, through YoloH, valued at$520,000. As of December 31, 2005, YoloH was owned 100% by Yolo. In March 2006, Yolo sold 49.84% of its membership interest in YoloH to affiliates of Mr. Tanner for $309,000, leaving Yolo with a balance of 50.16% ownership interest in YoloH, valued at $211,000. On April 11, 2006, Yolo entered into an agreement with Mr. Tanner to sell the remaining 50.16% interest in YoloH to him for $211,000, which closed on April 19, 2006. Our basis in the property was $900,000, and therefore, Yolo recorded no gain or loss on the sale. Our management believes that terms of sale of the 65 acre parcel, including, without limitation, the sale price, are as fair as could have been obtained from an unaffiliated party in an arms length transaction. Roger Burlage was appointed as a director in July 2006 and served on the Board until his resignation on November 13, 2007. Prior to his appointment, in June 2005, Castlebridge Enteprises, Inc., a company that Mr. Burlage controls, entered into a Consultant Agreement with our subsidiary Worldwide Excellence, Inc. (WWE) to assist with financing. His consulting company was paid $50,000 in 2005; received a total of $25,000 in 2006 and was issued warrants to purchase 150,000 shares at exercise price ranging from $1.00 to $1.50, depending on time of exercise. In June of 2006, we entered into a transition services agreement with Jeffrey Edell, our former Co-CEO and non-executive Chairman of our Board. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Edell resigned his full time position and agreed to provide certain transition services and we waived a 60-day notice of termination of employment provision. Mr. Edell further agreed to be available to us on a non-exclusive basis for a period of sixty (60) days for the purpose of assisting us with the recruitment and hiring of his replacement and with the transition of his responsibilities, including with respect to pending financing and acquisition transactions. Mr. Edell further agreed to surrender 500,000 shares of common stock that were issued to him in connection with his employment agreement and the acquisition agreement pursuant to which we acquired WWE. In addition, Mr. Edell agreed to relinquish any claim to 1,337,500 earn-out shares to which he might otherwise have been entitled pursuant to the merger agreement by and between us and WWE. We have no other agreement with Mr. Edell to provide any services in the future. DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES We have adopted provisions in our certificate of incorporation that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty as directors, except for liability that cannot be eliminated under the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law provides that directors of a company will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty as directors, except for liabilities: · for any breach of their duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders; 38 · for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; · for unlawful payment of dividend or unlawful stock repurchase or redemption, as provided under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or · for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. In addition, our bylaws provide for the indemnification of officers, directors and third parties acting on our behalf, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware General Corporation Law, if our board of directors authorizes the proceeding for which such person is seeking indemnification (other than proceedings that are brought to enforce the indemnification provisions pursuant to the bylaws). We maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance. These indemnification provisions may be sufficiently broad to permit indemnification of the registrant's executive officers and directors for liabilities (including reimbursement of expenses incurred) arising under the Securities Act of 1933. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. No pending material litigation or proceeding involving our directors, executive officers, employees or other agents as to which indemnification is being sought exists, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened material litigation that may result in claims for indemnification by any of our directors or executive officers.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 commence on the following page. 39 As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries Index to Financial Statements Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm F-2 Consolidated Balance Sheets F-3 Consolidated Statements of Operations F-4 Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity F-5  F-6 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows F-7 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements F-8 F-1 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vertical Branding, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the two years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by man agement, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vertical Branding, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the two years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. /s/ HOLTZ RUBENSTEIN REMINICK LLP Melville, New York April 10, 2008 F-2 Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries Consolidated Balance Sheets December 31, 2007 2006 (In thousands, except share data) Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 30 $ 105 Accounts receivable, net 3,387 2,582 Due from factor - 573 Inventories 3,182 2,857 Infomercial production costs 621 252 Prepaid expenses, deposits and other current assets 786 1,422 Assets of discontinued operations 83 135 Total current assets 8,089 7,926 Property and equipment, net 381 234 Office building, net 3,987 4,165 Deferred costs, net 575 819 Deferred tax asset, net - 1,017 Retail distribution network, net 1,719 1,921 Goodwill 1,842 1,231 Other 554 424 Total assets $ 17,147 $ 17,737 Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity Current liabilities: Line of credit $ 1,651 $ - Current portion of long-term debt 1,540 2,630 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 4,573 4,519 Other current liabilities 67 114 Liabilities of discontinued operations 14 28 Total current liabilities 7,845 7,291 Long-term debt 4,451 6,550 Derivative liabilities - 512 Total liabilities 12,296 14,353 Minority voting interest in subsidiary 528 580 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders' equity: Preferred stock -$.001 par value; Authorized - 2,000,000 shares; Issued and outstanding - 912,500 shares Series A at December 31, 2007 and 1,111,209 shares at December 31, 2006 1 1 Common stock -$.001 par value; Authorized - 100,000,000 shares; Issued and outstanding - 29,642,264 shares at December 31, 2007, and 22,045,762 shares at December 31, 2006 30 22 Additional paid-in capital 15,031 10,021 Deferred compensation (954) (662) Accumulated deficit (9,785) (6,218) Treasury stock, at cost -0- shares at December 31, 2007 and 500,000 shares at December 31, 2006 - (360) Total stockholders' equity 4,323 2,804 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 17,147 $ 17,737 See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.

F-7 Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Nature of Business The Company was incorporated on May 18, 1990 under the laws of the State of Delaware. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company consolidated its transactional marketing and retail distribution business into a single segment called consumer products. This change reflects evolution of the manner in which management views and operates its consumer products business, with transactional marketing activities being used to leverage broader distribution, including traditional retail distribution sales and international sales. As a result of this consolidation, prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. The Company currently operates two business segments consisting of the consumer products business and the development and rental of real estate in New York and Connecticut. The Company, through other subsidiaries, is in the process of liquidating the discontinued operations of VBIs former medical division. Revenues in the consumer products business consists of direct to consumer transactional marketing sales and sales to major retail chains, also referred to as retail distribution sales. The Companys transactional marketing sales are conducted through WWE and its affiliates, the historical business of the Company after the Closing. The Companys name was subsequently changed to Worldwide Excellence, Inc. in September 2004. WWE is a consumer product branding company specializing in personal care and fitness, beauty and home consumer products. Typically, WWE obtains the exclusive worldwide marketing, distribution and manufacturing license rights to a particular product from its inventor or a business representative and develops the product brand through marketing campaigns utilizing the Internet, television, and print media, ultimately leveraging its retail and international distribution channels for sales directly to consumers or for sales to dow nstream business customers. On certain of WWE products, a long term annuity stream of revenue has been established through what WWE refers to as Continuity programs. Through WWEs Continuity programs, customers repurchase a particular product monthly or bi-monthly, thus maximizing the initial media investment to acquire that particular customer. The Company began its retail distribution sales on August 1, 2006 when it purchased certain assets from Adsouth Partners, Inc., through a newly formed subsidiary, Adsouth Marketing LLC (ASM). The Company acquired assets comprising Adsouth's consumer products division and assumed certain liabilities. VBI purchased rights to various consumer products and brands as well as succession to Adsouths wholesale and retail distribution channels and relationships. The Companys real estate business is conducted through two of VBIs subsidiaries. Yolo Equities Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary (Yolo), holds a mortgage on a real estate parcel and previously owned a 65-acre real estate parcel in Hunter, New York. The property was sold in March 2006. In accordance with the terms of the sale, through the partial ownership of various entities, the Company owned an interest in Mountaintrail of approximately 26%. On April 19, 2006, Yolo sold the remaining 26% interest it owned in Mountaintrail, and from that date, the Company has no interest in the property. See Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for related party disclosures and details of this transaction. The Company owns a forty-nine (49%) percent interest in Gateway Granby, LLC (Granby) a limited liability company that owns and operates an office building in East Granby, Connecticut. The office building contains approximately 52,000 square feet of rentable space and is located on 7.7 developable acres. The Company entered into an irrevocable proxy and agreement with certain members of the limited liability company who are stockholders of VBI, which agreement gives the Company voting and operational control of the limited liability company so long as the Company maintains its ownership interest in the limited liability company. Due to such voting control, Granby is consolidated with VBI, and the minority voting interests are recorded separately. Discontinued operations consists of the former medical financing business, conducted through Medical Financial Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary, which (i) purchased insurance claims receivables from medical practices and provided certain services to those practices; and (ii) three other subsidiaries, which were formed to provide additional management services to certain medical practices. VBI sold its continuing service obligations and the related future revenue rights of its medical financing business in exchange for preferential collection rates on the receivables that are expected to be collected. 2. Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. F-8 Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Reclassifications Certain prior year balances were reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 3. Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition Consumer Products Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when the products are shipped or picked up by the customers, provided that the price is fixed, title has been transferred and our ability to collect the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenues are net of estimated returns and other promotional allowances. Provisions for discounts to customers, estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the sales are recorded. The estimate, which varies from period to period, is based on cumulative historical rates and other appropriate facts known to management at the time. Provision for discounts to customers, estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments consist of the following (in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 Estimated returns $ 1935 $ 1844 Discounts 63 54 Other allowances 159 18 Total $ 2157 $ 1916 Real Estate The full accrual method is used on the sale of real estate if the profit is determinable, the Company is not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit and there is no continuing involvement with the property. If the buyer's initial and continuing investments are inadequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property, the installment method is used, resulting in the deferral of income. If there is continuing involvement with the property by the Company, the financing method is used. Rental income is recorded over the lease term as it becomes receivable according to the provisions of the lease. Rental income is recognized on a straight line basis if rentals vary materially during the term of the lease. Receivables Consumer Products Accounts receivable are reported at their net collectible amounts. The Company records a reserve against any accounts receivable for which the Company deems, in its judgment, that collection may be in doubt. The Company extends credit to customers and performs credit evaluations in the ordinary course of business. Real Estate Mortgages and notes receivable result from the sale of real estate. These receivables bear interest and are recorded at face value, less unamortized discount. Impairment Assessment. The Company evaluates the credit positions on its notes receivable and the value of the related collateral on an ongoing basis. The Company estimates that all of its notes receivable are fully collectible and the collateral is in excess of the related receivables. The Company evaluates its notes receivable that are past due as to the collectability of principal and interest. The Company considers the financial condition of the debtor, the outlook of the debtor's industry, decrease in the ratio of collateral values to loans and any prior write downs on loans. The above considerations are all used in determining whether the Company should suspend recording interest income on any notes receivable or provide for any loss reserves. F-9 Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis and are in finished goods form. Infomercial Production Costs Infomercial costs include the cost of production in progress for infomercials, which will air in future periods. The costs will be amortized as the programs air over the estimated useful life, currently 12 to 24 months. If it is determined that the related product will not meet the criteria to be marketed and aired, then the balance of the infomercial production costs of that program are expensed. Amortization expense included in selling expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $103,000 and $284,000, respectively. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while renewals and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. Amortization of leasehold improvements is calculated on the straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases. Estimated useful lives are as follows: Furniture and fixtures 7 years Computer, software, office and other equipment 3-5 years Building and building improvements 39 years Land improvements 15 years Tenant improvements 5-6 years Leasehold improvements 5 years Office Building Properties are carried at the lower of acquisition cost or market. The methods for valuing property and mortgages where current appraisals are unobtainable are based on management's best judgments regarding the economy and market trends. As a result, estimates may change based on ongoing evaluation of future economic and market trends. Such judgments are based on management's knowledge of real estate markets in general and of sale or rental prices of comparable properties in particular. Properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances give rise to question cash flows and current fair values or other indications that their carrying value may not be recoverable When such events or circumstances arise, an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows produced by the asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the asset's carrying value to determine if impairment exists pursuant to the requirements o f SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets". If the asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment loss is measured based on the excess of its carrying value over its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of its carrying value or net realizable value. Deferred Costs Deferred costs include costs to obtain financing and prepaid leasing commissions paid to brokers in the Companys real estate division. Deferred finance costs are amortized over the life of the loan. Deferred broker fees are amortized over the life of the tenants lease. Amortization of deferred costs is provided by application of the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows: Deferred finance fees 1-3 years Deferred factor guaranty fee (related party) 2 years Deferred brokerage commission 5-6 years Retail Distribution Network A portion of the total cost of the retail distribution business acquired on August 1, 2006, in excess of net assets acquired, was allocated to this intangible asset, recognizing the value of the 18,000 retail store distribution network. The intangible asset is being amortized over ten years, the estimated life of the acquired retail store distribution network. Amortization of retail distribution network for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 totaled approximately $202,000 and $82,000. F-10 Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The retail distribution network is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances arise, an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows produced by the retail distribution network is compared to its carrying value to determine if impairment exists pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets". If the asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment loss is measured based on the excess of its carrying value over its fair value. Amortization expense is estimated to approximate $202,000 per year through 2016. Goodwill Goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the net assets acquired in connection with: (i) the reverse merger on November 29, 2005 Merger Goodwill, and (ii) the acquisition of the Retail Distribution business acquired on August 1, 2006 Retail Distribution Goodwill. The excess of the costs over the assets acquired in connection with the reverse merger on November 29, 2005 are related to the benefits WWE derived from VBI being a publicly traded company with operations, assets and history. These benefits include the ability to use publicly traded equity for financing, acquisitions and the use of stock-based compensation. The excess of the costs over the net assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of the Retail Distribution business acquired on August 1, 2006 is a result of the Companys final determination, during the quarter ended September 30, 2007, of the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Adsouth Partners, Inc. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and will be tested more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value. When factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company compares the estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows produced by WWE and subsequent acquisitions financed by equity or convertible debt compared to the carrying value of goodwill to determine if an impairment loss should be recognized. Embedded Derivative Liabilities The Companys policy for evaluating its availability of sufficient equity shares to settle contracts that may require share settlement is based upon the earliest issuance date first (Sequencing). Accordingly, only the contracts with the latest issuance date for share settlements that exceed the amount of shares available would be required to be classified as a derivative liability. In order to calculate the derivative liabilities, the Company projected the following factors over various periods through July 31, 2009, the maturity date of the 10% secured convertible notes (the Notes) held by Gottbetter Capital Finance, LLC (together with its affiliate Gottbetter Capital Master, Ltd. Gottbetter): (i) future volatility of common stock is 190%, (ii) stock price annual growth rate was estimated at the cost of equity, (iii) default on registration requirements is 5.0%, (iv) default on change of control was projected at 2.0% initially, increasing .1% monthly, (v) availability of alternative financing to redeem the note, if exercise of redemption option was triggered, starting at 0%, increasing monthly by 5% to a maximum of 25%, and (vi) weighted average reset price is projected at $0.715 for warrants, and$.6805 for conversion. At the end of each successive quarterly period, the Company must re-measure the embedded derivative liabilities against revised projections, with the revisions therein directly based on the actual experience. Each of the above factors contributes differently to the actual calculations, but the Company believes the variations in its stock price to be the most significant. On March 5, 2007, the 10% secured convertible notes (the Notes) held by Gottbetter Capital Finance, LLC (together with its affiliate Gottbetter Capital Master, Ltd. Gottbetter) irrevocably waived (a) the right to receive, upon conversion of the Notes, shares of VBI common stock in excess of the number of shares then authorized but unissued, and (b) the right in the event of a default on registration requirements, to purchase shares of VBI common stock pursuant to the 3,000,000 warrants issued for a price per share below $.37, as adjusted for any stock splits, recapitalization, reclassification or the like. The Company believes that, by virtue of the waiver granted by Gottbetter on March 5, 2007, the Company achieved having sufficient authorized shares as of that date. At such time, the existing derivative liabilities were credited to equity at their then measured values. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using a balance sheet approach in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). The Company accounts for deferred income taxes by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the date of the balance sheet to differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. In determining the appropriate valuation allowance, the Company considers projected realization of tax benefits, book and taxable income trends, available tax strategies and the overall deferred tax position. F-11 Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Earnings (Loss) per Share Basic and diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income allocated to common stock by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. In accordance with FAS 128, Earnings per Share, the weighted average number of shares of common stock used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share is adjusted for the dilutive effects of potential common shares including, (i) the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants based on the treasury stock method, and (ii) the assumed conversion of convertible notes and convertible preferred stock. Assumed exercise or conversion of potential common shares is only if the exercise price and the conversion price exceeds the weighted average market price for the period, and that the entity records earnings from continuing operations, as the inclusion of such adjustments would otherwise be anti-dilutive to earnings per share from continuing operations. Potential common shares for the periods presented consist of the following: As of December 31, 2007 2006 Convertible preferred stock 1,825,000 2,222,418 Convertible debt 4,236,140 8,720,145 Warrants 12,325,667 5,544,000 Options 2,641,450 2,142,250 Total 21,028,257 18,628,813 During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded a loss available to common shareholders and as a result, the weighted average number of common shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is the same, and have not been adjusted for the effects of potential common shares from unexercised stock options and warrants, and the conversion of debt and convertible preferred stock, which were anti-dilutive for such periods. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid, short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Concentration of Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, money market mutual funds, commercial paper and trade and notes receivable. Major product lines in the consumer products division, which are in excess of 10% of net revenues, follow: Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 Product line A 58.6% 44.1% Product line B 20.0% - Product line C - 14.1% Product line D - 10.6% Product line E - 12.0% Product line F - - Major customers in the consumer products division, which are in excess of 10% of net revenues follows: Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 Customer A 17.9% 40.6% Customer B 11.9% 43.6% Customer C - 15.8% F-12 Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Revenue from real estate activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 consists of 56% from the sale of one parcel. Advertising Costs Media costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and totaled approximately $9,065,000 and $9,263,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Other advertising costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and totaled approximately $518,000 and $45,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments is made in accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments". The estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a sale. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments approximated their carrying values for all periods presented. Share-Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R) using the modified-prospective-transition method. Under the modified-prospective-transition method, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period for all share-based awards granted, modified or cancelled as of January 1, 2006. As allowed by SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," the Company elected to continue to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25), in accounting for its stock option grants to board members prior to January 1, 2006. Under APB 25, the Company did not recognize compensation expense upon the issuance of its stock options because the option terms were fixed and the exercise price equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date. Comprehensive Income (loss) Comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net income as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders equity. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 there were no such adjustments. Effects of New Accounting Pronouncements In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments - An Amendment of FASB No. 133 and 140. The purpose of SFAS statement No. 155 is to simplify the accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments by permitting fair value re-measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. SFAS No. 155 also eliminates the restriction on passive derivative instruments that a qualifying special-purpose entity may hold. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of any entity's first fiscal year beginning after September 15, 2006. The adoption of FAS 155 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy as defined in the standard. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding financial instruments in one of the categories (level 3), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of FAS 157 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operatio ns. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides a guidance on de-recognition, classification interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure F-13 Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and transition. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of SFAS No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). The new statement allows entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. If a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item, changes in that items fair value in subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in current earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of SFAS No. 159 on the Company's financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, this statement revises and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB also issued Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, this statement revise and converge internationally the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the effects, if any, that FASB No. 160 may have on its financial statements; however, since the Company has significant noncontrolling interest (i.e. minority interest), this standard could materially affect the presentation and disclosure of the noncontrolling interest, which may affect certain performance and equity ratios. 4. Business Acquisition Acquisition of Retail Distribution Business on August 1, 2006: On August 1, 2006, the Company purchased certain assets from Adsouth Partners, Inc. comprising Adsouth's consumer products division and assumed certain liabilities. VBI purchased rights to various consumer products and brands as well as succession to Adsouths wholesale and retail distribution channels and relationships and is included in the Companys consumer products division. The purchase price for the assets included a cash and stock component. The cash component was the payment of $1,525,000 at closing; subject to adjustment after closing based on the actual value of certain Adsouth assets and liabilities. On January 17, 2007, VBI determined that the actual value should be reduced by $844,000 to $681,000. The cash component was paid by delivery of a promissory note in the principal amount of $1,525,000. The original balance of the promissory note was adjusted to $681,000 as of the date of the acquisition. The reduction in the promissory note resulted in an overpayment of the promissory note by $150,000, which was satisfied in July 2007. The stock component of the purchase price was paid by issuance of 5.5 million shares of VBIs common stock (the Adsouth Shares). This transaction is being accounted for as the total of (a) Adsouth Shares issued by VBI, (b) the delivery of the Adsouth Note, and (c) the aggregate of all direct acquisition costs, for the net monetary assets of the consumer products division. The cost of the transaction to VBI was $2,040,000, which was comprised of (1) the issuance of a total of 5,522,500 shares of common stock, of which 5,500,000 shares were issued to Adsouth Partners, Inc and 22,500 shares which were issued to a consultant, (2) cash component of $681,000, and (3) $250,000 of direct costs related to the acquisition. Under the purchase method of accounting, the cost to acquire the assets of the Consumer Products Division plus the transaction costs, was allocated to its underlying net assets in proportion to their respective fair values. The allocation of the excess of the purchase price, over the fair value of the net assets has been recorded as an intangible asset, which has been allocated to acquired distribution channels. The fair value of the acquired distribution channels has been valued by an independent appraiser at approximately $2,000,000. The fair values of all other assets were estimated by VBIs and Adsout hs management at the time of the acquisition, subject to post closing price adjustments, which were determined on January 17, 2007. For the purposes of recording the acquisition, the Company has applied Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. The total cost of the acquisition is as follows (in thousands): Fair value of common stock issued to Adsouth Partners, Inc. on date of acquisition $ 1,100 Fair value common stock issued to a consultant for services allocated to the acquisition 9 Promissory note delivered to Adsouth Partners, Inc. 681 Transaction costs 250 Total purchase price $ 2,040 F-14 Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The fair value of common stock issued has been determined to be $.20 per share, which is based on an independent appraisal of the value of the 5,500,000 shares of restricted stock issued. As of December 31, 2007, the final purchase price allocation was as follows (in thousands): Accounts receivable $ 746 Inventory 907 Property and equipment 130 Accounts payable and accrued expenses (990) Notes payable (756) Intangible asset allocated to retail distribution channels 2,003 Total purchase price $ 2,040 Post Closing Acquisition Adjustments Subsequent to the twelve month period following the consummation of the business acquisition of the retail distribution network, management determined that the changing value of certain assets acquired, principally accounts receivable and inventory, were in excess of their fair value. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge to operations in 2007 of $465,000. 5.

The Company paid a discount fee equal to 6.5% of the total purchase price of the Notes, or a total of $375,400. In addition the Company paid a total of $35,000 in legal fees and other closing expenses to Gottbetter and affiliates as well as a finders fee totaling $300,000 to The Keystone Equities Group, an investment banking firm. The Company also issued to Gottbetter a five-year warrant to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $0.75 per share (the Warrant& #148;).The exercise price of the Warrant was subsequently reduced to, and is now fixed at, $0.37 per share pursuant to the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement entered into simultaneously with the Securities Purchase Agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement), as subsequently modified and amended. Total closing costs paid in connection with the Notes, including discount fee, were $1,052,000, which are being amortized over the 36 month life of the loan. The fair value of the warrants issued as determined by the Black-Scholes pricing model was $511,000. Amortization expense of the fair value of warrants issued for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was$171,000 and $71,000. The Notes mature on July 31, 2009.The Notes required monthly interest-only payments through May 31, 2007, and are thereafter amortized by equal monthly payments of principal and interest through the balance of the term of the Notes. On November 13, 2007, the Company and the Holders entered into an Agreement re Redemption of Convertible Notes (the Redemption Agreement) pursuant to which the Company pre-paid principal installments through July 31, 2008, thus reducing the then outstanding principal balance on the Notes by approximately $2 million to $2.68 million. The pre-payment was funded by the Companys sale of common stock and warrants. The Notes are convertible from time to time at the option of the Holders into common stock of the Company at the price per share equal to eighty percent (80%) of the average of the two lowest volume weighted average prices of the Companys common stock, as quoted by Bloomberg, LP, for the twenty-five (25) trading days immediately preceding the conversion date but in no event lower than a floor price of $0.69 (the Conversion Price).The $0.69 floor on the Conversion Price (the Floor Price) is subject to reduction to $0.345 in an Event of Default, as such term is defined in the Notes. Once an Event of Default, if any were to occur, is cured, the Floor Price resets to $0.69.Gottbetter may not convert the Notes or exercise the Warrant if such conversion or exercise would result in Gottbetter, together with any affiliate thereof, beneficially owning in excess of 4.99% of the then issued and outstanding shares of the Companys common stock. Under the terms of the Notes, the Company has the right to redeem all or a portion of the outstanding principal on the Notes by paying to the Holders an amount equal to the greater of (i) one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of the face amount redeemed plus accrued interest and (ii) eighty percent (80%) of the (x) product of the remaining conversion amount divided by the Conversion Price (not less than a $1.00) in effect on the trading day before the Companys redemption notice is sent and (y) the closing sale price on the trading day before the Company redemption notice is sent. In June 2007, the Company agreed to waive its right to redeem the Notes for an amount less than 130% of their face value in connection with receiving the Holders consent to the Company granting a first priority lien on various assets of the Company securing a $5 million asset-based line of credit. The securities issued in the private placement have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and until so registered the securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or availability of an applicable exemption from registration. The offering required the Company to prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement for the purpose of registering under the Securities Act of 1933 all of the shares of the Companys common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and the Notes pursuant to an the Registration Rights Agreement. Line of Credit: On June 4, 2007, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the BFI Agreement) with BFI Business Finance (Lender).Pursuant to the BFI Agreement, upon VBIs request, Lender will loan the Company up to the lesser of (i) $5,000,000 or (ii) the Borrowing Base. The Borrowing Base is defined as (i) 85% of the gross face amount of the eligible accounts receivable of the Companys Adsouth Marketing, LLC subsidiary (ASM), plus (ii) 30% of the current market cost of raw materials and finished goods that constitute ASMs eligible inventory, not to exceed the lesser of $700,000 or 50% of the eligible accounts receivable borrowing base. VBI has guaranteed ASMs obligations under the BFI Agreement pursuant to the General Continuing Guaranty executed by us in favor of Lender on June 4, 2007 (the Guaranty). Loans extended pursuant to the BFI Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum of 2.0% above the higher of (i) the prime rate as reported in the western edition of the Wall Street Journal from time to time or (ii) 6.5%.Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default (as defined below) the interest rate on amounts outstanding under the BFI Agreement will be increased three percentage points above the interest rate in effect immediately prior to such event of default.Interest will be payable monthly in arrears and the Company is required to pay at least $7,500 a month in interest regardless of the amounts outstanding under the BFI Agreement at any particular time. The Company is required to pay an annual loan fee equal to 1% of F-18 Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements the maximum amount of the credit line. The Company paid the annual loan fee of $50,000 at closing. In addition, there was approximately $28,000 of other closing costs paid in connection with the credit line. To secure its obligations under the Guaranty, VBI agreed to grant Lender a blanket security interest in all of the Companys assets pursuant to the Security Agreement executed by VBI in favor of Lender on June 4, 2007 (the Security Agreement). The BFI Agreement imposes certain covenants on VBI, ASM and the Companys Subsidiaries in its Transactional Marketing Business, which are included under the BFI Agreement. The BFI Agreement has an initial term of 12 months (the Basic Term) and thereafter shall automatically renew for successive 12 months periods (each a Renewal Term) so long as neither VBI nor Lender delivers written notice of its intention to terminate the BFI Agreement. During any Renewal Term, the BFI Agreement may be terminated by either party on at least 30 days prior written notice to the other party. VBI received an initial advance on June 6, 2007 in the amount of approximately $830,000 upon the execution of the BFI Agreement (the Initial Loan). The proceeds of the Initial Loan were used to payoff obligations owed to Marquette Commercial Finance under a previous factoring agreement which was simultaneously terminated by ASM, as well as to pay fees associated with the close of the BFI Agreement. A condition precedent to the Companys ability to borrow money under the credit line was the entry by Gottbetter Capital Master, Ltd. (Gottbetter), holder of senior convertible notes issued by VBI in the aggregate amount of $5.775 million (the Notes) and a security interest in VBIs assets, into subordination and intercreditor agreements acceptable to Lender. Pursuant to the Notes, VBI permitted to grant a first priority lien on its assets in connection with a working capital line of credit of up to$3 million. In order to induce Gottbetter to enter into the subordination and intercreditor agreements for the $5 million line from Lender, VBI agreed to waive certain rights under the Notes. In particular, VBI agreed that, in the event borrowing under the credit facility with Lender at any time exceeds $3 million, the Company will waive the right to redeem the Notes for an amount less than 130% of the face amount redeemed. Until su ch time that borrowing under the credit facility exceeds $3 million, the Notes will be redeemable by VBI at the greater of (i) 125% of the amount redeemed or (ii) the market value of the Notes on a converted basis, as determined under a formula provided in the Notes. Demand Note and Note Payable: In accordance with the terms of the assets purchased from Adsouth partners, Inc. Adsouth, VBI assumed certain liabilities as payment of the purchase price. The balance of the note assumed was approximately $756,000. In July 2007, the note was converted from a demand note into a one year note, maturing in July 15, 2008. The note bears interest at 18% per annum and is guaranteed by John P., Acunto, Jr., a former officer of Adsouth and current consultant to Adsouth, and a principal stockholder of Adsouths common stock. The loan requires monthly principal and interest payments of approximately $23,000 through June 15, 2008, and a balloon payment of the outstanding balance of approximately $246,000 on July 15, 2008. This note also required VBI to carve-out the receivables collateral related to the two retailers from the blanket security position held by BFI and Gottbetter. First Mortgage payable, office building: The East Granby Property is owned subject to a non-recourse first mortgage held by TD Banknorth, N.A. Under the first mortgage, the outstanding principle balance at December 31, 2007 was approximately $1,971,000 and accrued interest thereon at an annual interest rate of 5.53% through December 31, 2007.Thereafter, the interest rate changes every five years based upon the Index plus 275 basis points. The Index is the yield for United States Government Securities Five (5) Year Treasury Constant Maturities as described by the Federal Reserve System in the Federal Reserve Statistical Release H-15(519). The rate as of January 1, 2008 is 6.2%. The principal balance is being amortized in monthly installments of approximately $17,000, including interest. Second mortgage payable, office building : On July 13, 2006, the Company completed the closing of a $1.1 million second mortgage financing (the Second Mortgage Note) on the East Granby Property owned by Gateway Granby, LLC (Gateway or Granby). The Second Mortgage Note bears interest at the rate of 12.5% per annum and calls for monthly payments of $11,000 (interest only), with a balloon payment of $1.1 million at maturity. There is no prepayment penalty. The Second Mortgage Note will become due at the option of the lender, if Gateway shall, without prior written consent: (i) further encumber the mortgaged property with any lien imposed in connection with any other financing or (ii) issue new membership interests to members who do not currently own a controlling interest, but such transfer may be permitted between the Company and the other existing members of Gateway. Approximately $120,000 of fees were paid in connection with the Second Mortgage Note. Gateway made a distribution from the proceeds of the Note to: (i) VBI in the amount of approximately $490,000 and (ii) the other members of Gateway for $550,000. F-19 Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Company guaranteed repayment of the Note and has also pledged its membership interest in Gateway to the other members as a guaranty for $550,000 of the Second Mortgage Note and for any other obligation that VBI may have to the other Gateway members. VBI bears 100% of the costs of the Note and 60% of the interest costs with the other Gateway members bearing the remaining 40% of the interest costs.

Each Bond matures eighteen months after the issue date and may be extended for additional six month periods by mutual consent of the Company and the individual bondholders. As of December 31, 2007, all of the Bonds matured without renewal; however only one of the bondholders has requested repayment of the Bonds, which are now on a demand basis. The Company paid $25,000 to the bondholder in February 2008. Interest is payable monthly, and is calculated at a rate of prime plus 3% but not less than 9% per annum nor more than 15% per annum. The ra te of interest will be adjusted at the end of each calendar quarter. The rate of interest as of December 31, 2007 was 10.75%. On January 1, 2008, the rate of interest decreased to 10.25% for the next calendar quarter. Monthly interest-only payments are due through maturity. The Bonds may only be prepaid on 120 days prior written notice.

Factoring Agreements: In November 2006, the Companys Adsouth Marketing, LLC (ASM) subsidiary completed an account transfer and purchase agreement with a factoring company. This agreement was terminated in June 2007 in connection with the closing of a line of credit with BFI Business Finance. In November 2006, the Company on behalf of its Worldwide Excellence, Inc. (WWE) subsidiary completed a receivables purchase agreement with a factoring company for products that were sold to WWEs transactional marketing customers under multiple payment terms. Under multiple payment terms, a customers credit card is charged for payment of the sale up to five times, on a monthly basis, until the full purchase price is received. WWE may sell qualified receivables to the factoring company without recourse except as provided by the following. Any receivables purchased (Purchases Contracts) by the factoring company, where the first payment is not paid by the customer within 60 days, will be considered cancelled and then replaced by WWE. In addition, any Purchased Contracts that result in a credit card chargeback by the customer must be bought back by WWE or replaced. WWE pays a discount ranging from (i) 8% of the gross amount for receivables that are due within three months of sale, to (ii) 10% of the gross amount for receivables that are due within five months of sale. If the prime rate is above 7%, the discount may be adjusted on the first day of each calendar month, up or down, by one-half of the change in the prime rate. WWE is advanced 85% of the amount of the Purchased Contracts. The remaining 15% is held as a reserve by the factoring company. The factoring company shall hold a minimum reserve to be equal to the total of 15% of the outstanding purchase price with respect to Purchased Contracts that are payable in zero months to five months on such date. The reserves shall be pooled and aggregated for all Purchased Contracts during a calendar month. Each such monthly pooled reserve shall be held for 150 days. The reserves are held in account that is owned by the Company and is not commingled with any other funds of th e factoring company. WWE has granted the factoring company a security interest in all Purchased Contracts and the reserve account. Each sale of an account receivable was treated as a sale, and not as a secured borrowing, pursuant to SFAS 140. Each sale reduced the Company's accounts receivable on its balance sheet by the face amount and increased cash by the net amount received by the Company (after deducting the purchase discount applied from the face amount). The term of the agreement is for one year and shall automatically renew for up to two consecutive additional one year periods thereafter, unless sooner terminated. F-20 Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Aggregate maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2007 is as follows (in thousands): Year ending December 31, 2008 $ 3,486 2009 2,854 2010 110 2011 116 2012 122 Thereafter 1,422 Total principal payments 8,110 Less unamortized note discount (198) Less fair value of warrants issued as additional consideration for 10% secured convertible notes (270) Total debt $ 7,642 9. Derivative Liabilities : As of December 31, 2006, the Gottbetter financing contained a conversion feature where there would be an indeterminate number of shares that may be required to share settle the obligation, but the amount of shares to settle would only be an indeterminate number if the Company was in default. The Company concluded that in the event of default under the Gottbetter financing, it is possible that VBI may not have sufficient authorized shares available to meet the potential commitment. Since the Company was not in default under the Gottbetter financing as of December 31, 2006, VBI concluded that it had sufficient number of authorized shares to meet any other common share requirements based on existing convertible debt, convertible preferred stock, warrants and any other potential commitments, and accordingly, did not reclassify any of these commitments as derivative liability. On March 5, 2007, Gottbetter irrevocably waived (a) the right to receive, upon conversion of the Notes, shares of VBI common stock in excess of the number of shares then authorized but unissued, and (b) the right in the event of a default on registration requirements, to purchase shares of VBI common stock pursuant to the 3,000,000 warrants issued for a price per share below $.37, as adjusted for any stock splits, recapitalization, reclassification or the like. The Company believes that, by virtue of the waiver granted by Gottbetter on March 5, 2007, the Company achieved having sufficient authorized shares as of that date. At such time the, the existing derivative liabilities were credited to equity at their then measured values. 10.Commitments and Contingencies Minimum Operating Lease Commitments The Company leases office facilities pursuant to operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through September 2011.

The Order was with among others, Buckhead Marketing and Distribution LLC, PAP Systems LLC and Nancy Duitch individually resulting from the Marketing of the Peel Away the Pounds Weight Loss System.

As part of the consent order, the Company paid $1,000,000 to the FTC in 2004, which was accrued in 2003.The Order is binding upon the corporate successors and assigns. The Order also applies in certain instances to any business in which Nancy Duitch is an officer or director, or has a majority ownership interest in, directly or indirectly controls, or any other business in which Nancy Duitch is engaged in activity related to the marketing of any product, service or program th at provides health benefits, including weight or inch loss or related benefits, or the marketing of any food, drug or cosmetic where certain claims are made, but only to the extent that such business acts in active concert or participation with Ms. Duitch.

The Company also agreed to register such shares for resale in accordance with the terms of a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the SPA. Closing costs of approximately $172,000 were charged to capital in excess of par. Reclassification of Imbedded Derivative Liabilities to Capital On March 5, 2007, the 10% secured convertible notes (the Notes) held by Gottbetter Capital Finance, LLC (together with its affiliate Gottbetter Capital Master, Ltd. Gottbetter) irrevocably waived (a) the right to receive, upon conversion of the Notes, shares of VBI common stock in excess of the number of shares then authorized but unissued, and (b) the right in the event of a default on registration requirements, to purchase shares of VBI common stock pursuant to the 3,000,000 warrants issued for a price per share below $.37, as adjusted for any stock splits, recapitalization, reclassification or the like.

At such time the, the existing derivative liabilities were credited to equity at their then measured values. Treasury Stock As reported on Current Reports filed on Forms 8-K dated June 6, 2006 and June 9, 2006, Jeffrey S. Edell resigned his position as President and Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective June 13, 2006, and was simultaneously appointed non-executive Chairman of the Board. In connection with his resignation, Mr. Edell and the Company entered into a transition services agreement dated June 9, 2006. Under the terms of the agreement Mr. Edell agreed to surrender to the Company 500,000 shares (Returned Common Shares) of VBI common stock that were issued to him in connection with his Employment Agreement and the Acquisition Agreement that closed on November 29, 2005. The Company valued the treasury shares at the closing market price on June 9, 2006, which was $.72 per share for an aggregate of $360,000.

Stock Option Plan In July 2006, the Board of Directors approved the Companys 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan), which was approved by consent of the majority shareholders in September 2006. Under the Plan, the Company may issue up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate pursuant to all awards granted under the 2006 Plan. The awards include nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options warrants, restricted stock and stock purchases. The 2006 Plan is administered by the Board of Directors of the Company, or by any committee that the Company may form and to which the Board of Directors may delegate the authority to perform such functions (in either case, the Committee). The 2006 Plan is accounted for in accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards. ("FAS") No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("FAS 123(R)"), which replaces FAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to F-26 Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Employees, and related interpretations.FAS 123 (R) requires compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions, including employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements. In addition, the Company adheres to the guidance set forth within Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 107, which provides the Staff's views regarding the interaction between SFAS No. 123(R) and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations with respect to the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. As a result of the adoption of FAS 123 (R), the Company's results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 include share-based compensation expense totaling approximately $570,000 and $218,000. No income tax benefit has been recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation arrangements due to history of operating losses. Stock option compensation expense is the estimated fair value of options granted amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The weighted average estimated fair value of all awards granted under the 2006 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $.40 and $.39, respectively. The fair value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions made in calculating the fair values of options are as follows: Years ended December 31, 2006 2007 Risk free interest rate 3.25% - 4.85% 4.0% - 5.5% Expected dividend yield 0% 0% Expected lives 3 years 2 - 3 years Expected volatility 132.64% to 124.38% to 179.85% 180% The Company granted 561,000 options, 926,717 shares of restricted stock and 40,000 warrants under the 2006 Plan during the year ended December 31, 2007. The Company granted 2,122,000 options, 163,750 shares of restricted stock and 15,000 warrants under the 2006 Plan during the year ended December 31, 2006.

The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, was $337,000 and $141,000, respectively. Shares Reserved for Future Issuances As of December 31, 2007, there were outstanding options convertible into 2,641,450 shares of common stock, warrants convertible into 12,325,667 shares of common stock, 912,500 shares of Series A preferred stock, convertible into 1,825,000 shares of common stock, and debentures that are convertible into 4,236,140 shares of common stock. In addition, under various employment agreements: (i) options to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock may be granted through April 2017, and (ii) a right to earn of up to 444,000 shares of restricted common stock through July 15, 2009, if certain performance goals are met. If the performance goals are met, and the Company issues the additional options, and the common stock is earned, there will be 1,158,033 shares available to grant under the 2006 Plan. 12. Other Charges VBI incurred additional costs due to events that lead to the bankruptcy of one of its third party fulfillment centers, National Fulfillment (NFI). In September 2007, the Company discovered that during the quarter ended September 30, 2007, NFI had failed to pay their third party shipping vendors, causing actual customer shipments to be delayed or not shipped at all. In the weeks prior to September 19, 2007 management suspected a problem with shipments, however, NFI tried to hide the problem by deflecting VBIs requests for information. VBI immediately paid the third party shipping vendors and instructed them to ship all products that were unshipped. As of September 30, 2007, all such products were shipped. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur costs in excess of normal business expenditures due to NFIs actions. Among these costs are duplicate shipping charges, processing fees for returns and cancellations, increased customer service costs, costs to ship inventory from NFI to new facilities, and the costs to receive the product at the new facilities. These costs are being reported as a separate component of Costs and Expenses. The Company has retained legal counsel to recover these costs as well as other costs which are still to be determined. Management has implemented controls, including daily receipt of tracking numbers for shipped packages and weekly physical inspection to be certain that there are no packages that have been segregated for shipment and remain unshipped . Total excess costs incurred included in other charges for the year ended December 31, 2007 was approximately $689,000.The Company will continue to segregate the costs associated with the event for as long as they continue to be material to our results of operations. The Company determined subsequent to the twelve month period following the consummation of the business acquisition of the retail distribution network that the changing value of certain assets acquired, principally accounts receivable and inventory, were in excess of their fair value. Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes a $465,000 write-down of these assets. F-28 Vertical Branding, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 13.

The Company reviews the adequacy of valuation allowances and releases the allowances when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized.

Discontinued Operations The remaining receivables from the former medical financing business, conducted through various subsidiaries of VBI, were included in the net assets that were acquired in the reverse merger acquisition on November 29, 2005. On February 4, 2004, VBI instituted a plan to restructure the medical financing segment. The plan of restructuring called for VBI to sell the assets of the three subsidiaries that were formed to provide additional management services to certain medical practices. On August 26, 2004, VBI sold its continuing service obligations and the related future revenue rights of its medical financing business in exchange for preferential collection rates on the receivables that are expected to be collected. As part of the terms of the sale, VBI will retain half of the interest paid by insurance companies on late payments from improperly denied receivables. An estimated reserve for future collection costs has been established as of November 29, 2005. The Company still incurred certain employment costs, through 2006. Occupancy costs related to VBIs New Rochelle, New York office were also allocated to discontinued operations. The lease expired in February 2007, and has not been renewed. The medical financing business was conducted through Medical Financial Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary, which (i) purchased insurance claims receivables from medical practices and provided certain services to those practices; and (ii) three other subsidiaries, which were formed to provide additional management services to certain medical practices. Accordingly, the operating results of the medical financing segment for the period from November 29, 2005, the date of the reverse merger agreement, through December 31, 2007 have been presented as "(Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes". Net assets and liabilities to be disposed of or liquidated, at their net realizable value, have been separately classified in the accompanying balance she et at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Business Segment Information Operating segments are managed separately and represent separate business units that offer different products and serve different markets. The Company's reportable segments include: (1) consumer product sales, (2) real estate, and (3) other, which is comprised of corporate overhead and discontinued operations. The consumer products business operates from the Companys offices in Encino, California and Boca Raton, Florida.

Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution. The following table sets forth the estimated expenses to be incurred in connection with the issuance and distribution of the securities being registered. Registration Fee $180 Legal Fees and Expenses $20,000 Accounting Fees and Expenses $5,000 Miscellaneous $2,000 Total $27,180 Item 14 . Indemnification of Directors and Officers Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law authorizes a court to award, or a corporations board of directors to grant, indemnity to officers, directors and other corporate agents in terms sufficiently broad to permit such indemnification under certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations. The registrants certificate of incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of its directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty as directors. In addition, the registrants bylaws provide for the indemnification of officers, directors and third parties acting on our behalf, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware General Corporation Law, if our Board of Directors authorizes the proceeding for which such person is seeking indemnification (other than proceedings that are brought to enforce the indemnification provisions pursuant to the bylaws). The registrant maintains director and officer liability insurance. These indemnification provisions may be sufficiently broad to permit indemnification of the registrants executive officers and directors for liabilities (including reimbursement of expenses incurred) arising under the Securities Act of 1933. Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On July 21, 2005, the registrants Board of Directors declared a stock split in the form of a 35% stock dividend on the shares of its common stock outstanding on August 8, 2005, the record date for shareholders who were entitled to receive thirty five one hundredths (.35) of a share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, for each one share of common stock owned of record on the close of business on August 8, 2005. The following discussion gives effect to the stock split even if the transaction reported happened prior to the August 8, 2005. In February 2003, the registrants Board of Directors authorized the issuance of $450,000 of Series B Bonds. The Series B Bonds mature eighteen months after the issue date and may be extended for additional six month periods by mutual consent of the registrant and the individual bondholders. Interest is payable monthly, and is calculated at a rate of prime plus 3% but not less than 9% per annum nor more than 15% per annum. The rate of interest will be adjusted at the end of each calendar quarter. Monthly interest-only payments are due through maturity. The Series B Bonds may only be prepaid on 120 days prior written notice. The registrant, at the option of the bondholders, may be required to prepay on 60 days prior written notice, up to an aggregate of $50,000 per bondholder per 60 day period. The registrant relied on section 506 of the Securities Act of 1933 to issue the securities, inasmuch as the securities we re sold without any form of general solicitation or general advertising and sales were made only to accredited investors. On July 7, 2005, the registrant sold 33,678 shares of its treasury stock to its Chief Financial Officer, who was also a director. The sales price was $0.75 per share. The registrant relied on section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 to issue the securities inasmuch as the registrant did not engage in general solicitation or advertising in making this offering and the offeree occupied an insider status relative to the registrant that afforded him effective access to the information registration would otherwise provide. On July 25, 2005, the registrant sold 270,000 shares of its common stock to certain of its officers and directors. The sale price was $0.74 per share. The registrant relied on section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 to issue the securities inasmuch as the registrant did not engage in general solicitation or advertising in making this offering and the offeree occupied an insider status relative to the registrant that afforded him effective access to the information registration would otherwise provide. 58 Between September and November 2005, the registrant completed two offerings consisting of secured promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $825,000 (the Notes) and warrants (the Bridge Warrants) to purchase in the aggregate amount 825,000 shares of common stock. The Notes accrued interest at the annual rate of 10% and matured the earlier of (a) 6 months from the date of issuance or (b) the closing of the exchange of the registrants common stock for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Worldwide Excellence, Inc. (the Stock Exchange). The holders of the Note were given the right to convert the Notes to shares of the registrants preferred stock at the conversion rate of $1.00 per share at the closing of the Stock Exchange. Effective November 29, 2005, all of the noteholders, with the exception of one person, exercised their rights to convert. The Bridge Warrants entitle the holders, for a period of three years; shares of common stock at a purchase price of $1.00 per share. The Bridge Warrant holders are entitled to certain piggyback registration rights under the terms of the registration rights agreement between the holders and the registrant. The registrant relied on section 506 of the Securities Act of 1933 to issue the securities, inasmuch as the securities were sold without any form of general solicitation or general advertising and sales were made only to accredited investors. On November 29, 2005, the registrant issued 11,500,000 shares of common stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Worldwide Excellence, Inc. The registrant issued an additional 710,000 shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase 150,000 shares of common stock to a consultant as a finders fee. The warrant has a term of three years. The warrant exercise price is $1.00 per share if purchased prior to November 29, 2006, at an exercise price of $1.25 per share if the exercise occurs after November 29, 2006 but on or before November 29, 2007 and$1.50 per share if purchased after that date. The registrant also issued 35,000 shares of common stock to its legal counsel as compensation for services rendered in this transaction. The registrant relied on section 506 of the Securities Act of 1933 to issue the common stock for the exchange, inasmuch as the securities were sold without any form of general solic itation or general advertising and sales were made only to accredited investors. The registrant relied on section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 to issue the securities to the consultant and legal counsel, inasmuch as the securities were issued without any form of general solicitation or general advertising and the acquirers were accredited investors. On November 29, 2005, in conjunction with the acquisition of Worldwide Excellence, Inc., the registrant issued 500,000 shares of common stock to holders of promissory notes having an aggregate value of $500,000. These shares include: (i) 100,000 shares to a director and officer in consideration for the conversion of certain promissory notes having an aggregate value of $100,000; (ii) 75,000 shares to a director in consideration for the conversion of certain promissory notes having an aggregate value of $75,000 and (iii) 325,000 shares to other non-related parties for the conversion of certain promissory notes having an aggregate value of $325,000. The registrant relied on section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 to issue the securities inasmuch as the securities were issued without any form of general solicitation or general advertising and the acquirers were accredited investors. On November 29, 2005, also in conjunction with the acquisition of Worldwide Excellence, Inc., the registrant issued four warrants covering a total of 264,000 shares of common stock. The warrants were issued to four individuals who agreed to convert debt to equity, or who extended credit terms to the registrant. The warrants each have a term of three years. Two of the warrants, covering a total of 139,000 shares, may be exercised for $1.00 per share if exercised before November 29, 2006, and for $1.50 per share if exercised thereafter. A warrant covering 80,000 shares may be exercised for $1.00 per share. The final warrant, covering 45,000 shares, may be exercised for $1.00 per share before November 29, 2006, for $1.25 per share after November 29, 2006 but before November 29, 2007, and for$1.50 per share thereafter. The registrant relied on section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 to issue the securities, inasmuch as the se curities were issued without any form of general solicitation or general advertising and the acquirers were accredited investors. In conjunction with the acquisition of Worldwide Excellence, Inc., the registrant issued a warrant to purchase 275,000 shares of common stock to a consultant. The warrant has a term of three years at an exercise price of $1.00 per share During November and December 2005, the registrant sold units consisting of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock to various accredited investors. The registrant sold 1,205,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that may be converted into 2,410,000 shares of common stock and warrants that will allow the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to purchase 1,205,000 shares of common stock. The warrants have a term of three years. The warrants may be exercised for $1.00 per share if exercised before November 29, 2006, and for $1.50 per share if exercised thereafter. The registrant relied on section 506 of the Securities Act of 1933 to issue the securities, inasmuch as the securities were sold without any form of general solicitation or general advertising and sales were made only to accredited investors. On February 10, 2006, $100,000 of Series B Bonds were converted into 100,000 shares of our common stock. In accordance with terms of the Acquisition Agreement, which closed on November 29, 2005, the Series B Bondholders have the right to convert their Bonds into common stock at the rate of $1 per share. There were no expenses in connection with this conversion. This issuance was made pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by section 4(2) and Regulation D of the Securities of 1933. 59 On April 3, 2006, we issued to a consultant, three-year warrants to purchase 10,000 shares of our common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.50 per share. The issuances were made pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. On July 27, 2006, we issued two warrants for consulting services a total of 340,000 shares of our common stock valued at $204,000. Under a subsequent agreement, on November 15, 2006, 41,250 of these shares were returned to us. Additionally, one of the consultants received three-year warrants to purchase 75,000 shares of our common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.80 per share. The issuances were made pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. On August 2, 2006, we closed a financing transaction in which we sold 10% secured convertible notes (the Notes) to Gottbetter Capital Finance, LLC (Gottbetter) to raise $5,775,400 pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement dated thereof (the Securities Purchase Agreement). We received $2,887,700 upon closing and received another $2,887,700 on the date the registration statement was filed pursuant to a Investors Registration Rights Agreement dated July 31, 2006 thereof between the Company and Gottbetter (the Registration Rights Agreement). The Notes mature on July 31, 2009. The Notes are convertible from time to time into our common stock by Gottbetter at the price per share equal eighty percent (80%) of the average of the two lowest volume weighted average prices of our common stock, as quoted by Bloomberg, LP, for the twenty-five (25) trading days immediately preceding the conversion date but in no event lower than a floor price of $0.69 (the Conversion Price). We have an option to redeem a portion or all of the outstanding principle convertible Notes with the redemption price being the greater of (i) one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of the face amount redeemed plus accrued interest and (ii) eighty percent (80%) of the (x) product of the remaining conversion amount divided by the Conversion Price (not less than a $1.00) in effect on the trading day before our redemption notice is sent and (y) the closing sale price on the trading day before our redemption notice is sent. Gottbetter also received a five-year warrant to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.75 per share (the Warrant). The issuances were made pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933. On August 1, 2006, we closed our purchase of certain assets from Adsouth Partners, Inc. pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. We, through a newly formed subsidiary, Adsouth Marketing LLC, acquired assets comprising Adsouth's consumer products division and assumed certain liabilities. The purchase price for the assets included a cash and stock component. The stock component of the purchase price was paid by issuance of 5.5 million shares of our common stock (the Adsouth Shares), 750,000 shares of which are being held in escrow to satisfy potential indemnification obligations of Adsouth. The issuances of the promissory note to Adsouth and the Adsouth Shares were made pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933. On September 19, 2006, we entered into an investor relations consulting agreement with an expiration date of September 30, 2007. Under the terms of the agreement, a portion of the compensation is payable at the rate of $7,500 per month in unregistered, restricted VBI common stock. The stock is to be issued in advance quarterly installments, within five business days of the beginning of each calendar quarter. The number of shares to be issued is based on the volume weighted average price (VWAP) for VBIs common stock during the ten trading days prior to the end of the preceding calendar quarter. As of December 31, 2006, the calculation of the VWAP resulted in a per share price of $.75. In January 2007, we issued 30,000 shares of unregistered, restricted common stock as payment for the fee, which covers the period from January 1, 2007 through March 31, 2007.

The stock is to be issued in advance quarterly installments, within at the beginning of each calendar quarter. On January 2, 2008, we issued 10,000 shares of unregistered, restricted common stock as payment for the fee, which covers the period from January 1, 2008 through March 31, 2008. The stock was valued at$.43 per share. The issuance was made pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules (a) Exhibits. The exhibits filed with this registration statement or incorporated herein by reference are set forth on the Exhibit Index set forth elsewhere herein. (b) Financial Statement Schedules. Schedules filed with this registration statement are set forth on the Index to Financial Statements set forth elsewhere herein. Item 17. Undertakings (a) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act); (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information in this registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pursuant to Rule 424(b), if in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) Include any additional or changed material information on the plan of distribution. (2) For purposes of determining liability under the Securities Act, to treat each post-effective amendment as a new registration statement of the securities offered, and the offering of the securities at that time to be the initial bona fide offering. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. 61 Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Company has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Company of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Company in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Company will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by it is again st public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. Each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. 62 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Los Angeles, State of California, on April 15, 2008.
