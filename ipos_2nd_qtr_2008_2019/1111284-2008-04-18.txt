PROSPECTUS SUMMARY About Us Through the Contractual Arrangements with the Jin Ma Companies which are described in greater detail later in this prospectus, we operate, control and beneficially own the construction, hotel and real estate development businesses of the Jin Ma Companies. The Jin Ma Companies are located in Autonomous Region of Inner Monglolia in China and include Jin Ma Construction, Jin Ma Hotel, and Jin Ma Real Estate. Jin Ma Construction is an engineering and construction company that offers general contracting, construction management and building design services primarily in Hohhot City. Jin Ma Hotel owns and operates the Inner Mongolia Jin Ma Hotel, a 22-room full service hotel situated in Hohhot City approximately 15 kilometers from the Hohhot Baita Airport and Jin Ma Real Estate is a real estate development company. The Contractual Arrangements are comprised of a series of agreements, including a Consulting Services Agreement and an Operating Agreement, through which we have the right to advise, consult, manage and operate each of the Jin Ma Companies, and collect and own all of their respective net profits. Additionally, under a Shareholders Voting Rights Proxy Agreement, the Jin Ma Companies shareholders have vested their voting control over the Jin Ma Companies to us. In order to further reinforce our rights to control and operate the Jin Ma Companies, these companies and their shareholders have granted us, under an Option Agreement, the exclusive right and option to acquire all of their equity interests in the Jin Ma Companies or, alternatively, all of the assets of the Jin Ma Companies. Further the Jin Ma Companies shareholders have pledged all of their rights, titles and interests in the Jin Ma Companies to us under an Equity Pledge Agreement. The terms of each of these contracts expire in August 2016. 2 The relationship among the above companies as follows: Other than the Contractual Arrangements with the Jin Ma Companies of which Gold Horse International, Gold Horse Nevada and Global Rise are parties, we do not have any business or operations. IMTD was recently formed and currently has no business or operations. We may use it in the future to internally reorganize certain of our operations. As described in the financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus, our assets and liabilities at each of December 31, 2007 and June 30, 20007 and the results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2007 and the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 are those of the Jin Ma Companies. All of the assets and operations of the Jin Ma Companies are located in the PRC. Notwithstanding that Gold Horse and the Jin Ma Companies are separate legal entities and the legal obligations of the parties are governed by the Contractual Arrangements, there is commonality of control between Gold Horse and the Jin Ma Companies as set forth in the following table: Name Executive Officer of Gold Horse Director of Gold Horse Principal Shareholder of Gold Horse Stockholder of The Jin Ma Companies (1) Liankuan Yang √ √ √ √ Yang Yang √ √ √ Runlan Ma √ √ (1) Each of Jin Ma Construction, Jin Ma Hotel, and Jin Ma Real Estate are owed 70% by Liankuan Yang, 15% by Runlan Ma, the spouse of Liankuan Yang, and 15% by Yang Yang, the daughter of Liankuan Yang.

Our fiscal year end is June 30. 3 Our history We were incorporated in New Jersey in March 2000 under the name Segway III Corp as a shell company. In December 2004, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement and Share Exchange with Speedhaul Incorporated pursuant to which we acquired all of the shares of Speedhaul Incorporated, a company formed in June 2004. As a result of this transaction, our business plan was that of an Internet subscription based load and equipment posting and searching service for the freight trucking business. Thereafter, we changed our corporate name to Speedhaul Holdings, Inc. Prior to June 29, 2007, we were a development stage company attempting to implement our business plan. On June 29, 2007, we executed the Share Exchange Agreement with Gold Horse Nevada whereby we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Gold Horse Nevada in exchange for the issuance of shares of our common stock to the Gold Horse Nevada stockholders. Gold Horse Nevada conducts its business operations through its wholly owned subsidiary Global Rise. The acquisition of Gold Horse Nevada was accounted for as a reverse merger because on a post-merger basis, the members of Gold Horse Nevada held a majority of our outstanding common stock on a voting and fully-diluted basis. In November 2007 we domesticated our company in Florida under the name Gold Horse International, Inc. Gold Horse Nevada was formed in August 2006. Gold Horse Nevada entered into the Contractual Arrangements with each of the Jin Ma Companies and their respective shareholders on August 31, 2006. On June 29, 2007, concurrently with the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Contractual Arrangements were amended and restated and we were made a party to the Contractual Arrangements. Previously, in December 2005, the Jin Ma Companies had engaged a subsidiary of Genesis Technology Group, Inc., a publicly held company now known as Genesis Pharmaceuticals Enterprises, Inc. (Genesis), to advise it regarding methods to become a U.S. public company. The formation of Gold Horse Nevada and its wholly owned subsidiary Global Rise and the negotiation and execution of the Contractual Arrangements between Gold Horse Nevada and the Jin Ma Companies followed this engagement. During the term of the consulting agreement, which ended upon the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement with our company, Genesis also provided various management advisory services to Gold Horse Nevada and recommended Western directors for its Board of Directors. In September 2006 Gold Horse Nevada and its stockholders entered into an agreement and plan of share exchange with Genesis whereby Genesis was to acquire Gold Horse Nevada in exchange for approximately 65% of its securities which would have been issued to the Gold Horse Nevada stockholders. The closing of share exchange between Genesis and Gold Horse Nevada was conditioned upon a number of events. In October 2006 Genesis notified the Gold Horse Nevada stockholders of its decision not to proceed with the transaction and the agreement did not close. On the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement we issued Genesis 8,542,500 shares of our common stock valued at $0.18 as an assignee of the Gold Horse Nevada stockholders as compensation under the terms of the consulting agreement with it. ABOUT THE OFFERING On November 30, 2007 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell an aggregate of $3,275,000 principal amount 10% secured convertible debentures to seven accredited investors and to issue those investors common stock purchase warrants to purchase an aggregate of 9,520,352 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share as described later in this prospectus. This prospectus covers the resale of a total of 6,786,320 shares of our common stock by selling security holders which includes 3,781,754 shares that are issuable upon the conversion of $1,300,923 principal amount 10% secured convertible debentures, 325,191 shares that are issuable as interest payments on those debentures and 2,679,375 shares that are issuable upon the exercise of warrants. Selling security holders may resell their shares from time-to-time, including through broker-dealers, at prevailing market prices. We will not receive any proceeds from the resale of our shares by the selling security holders. To the extent the warrants are exercised on a cash basis, we will receive the exercise price of the warrants. We will pay all of the fees and expenses associated with registration of the shares covered by this prospectus. 4 10% Secured Convertible Debentures : Interest payable at 10% per annum at each of January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 in cash or shares of registered common stock.

You should not invest in our common stock unless you can afford to lose your entire investment. You should consider carefully the following risk factors and other information in this prospectus before deciding to invest in our common stock. Risks Relating to Overall Business Operations We do not have any operations other than pursuant to the Contractual Arrangements with the Jin Ma Companies. The term of those Contractual Arrangements is only for 10 years and there are no assurances those agreements will be renewed. Neither Gold Horse International nor its subsidiaries Gold Horse Nevada or Global Rise or IMTD are engaged in any business or operations other than pursuant to the terms of the various Contractual Arrangements with the Jin Ma Companies as described elsewhere in this prospectus. As such, we are completely dependent on the Contractual Arrangements. We do not generate any revenues and have no assets. All of the Jin Ma Companies assets and operations are located in the PRC. As described in the financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus, the assets and liabilities at each of December 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007 and the results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 are those of the Jin Ma Companies. The Contractual Arrangements are subject to enforcement under the laws of the PRC. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to enforce these contracts. If we are unable to enforce any legal rights we may have under these contracts or otherwise, our ability to continue as a going concern is in jeopardy. In addition, the terms of these contracts expire in August 2016 and there are no assurances these agreements will be renewed. If the Contractual Arrangements are not renewed or are significantly modified, unless we have expanded our business and operations, of which there are no assurances, we will in all likelihood be forced to cease our operations. Our Contractual Arrangements with the Jin Ma Companies and their respective shareholders may not be as effective in providing control over these entities as direct ownership. We have no equity ownership interest in the Jin Ma Companies and rely on the Contractual Arrangements to control and operate such businesses. These contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over the Jin Ma Companies as direct ownership. For example, any of the Jin Ma Companies could fail to take actions required for our businesses despite its contractual obligation to do so. If the Jin Ma Companies fail to perform under their agreements with us, we may have to rely on legal remedies under PRC law, which may not be effective. In addition, we cannot assure you that the Jin Ma Companies shareholders would always act in our best interests. Our President and CEO is also the CEO and founder of the Jin Ma Companies. We are not receiving the benefit of certain terms of the Contractual Arrangements and there are no assurances that the conflicts of interest between obligations to our company and obligations to the Jin Ma Companies will be resolved by Mr. Yang in our favor. Our President and CEO is also the founder and CEO of the Jin Ma Companies. Pursuant to the Contractual Arrangements we have the ability to control the daily operations and financial affairs of the Jin Ma Companies, appoint each of their senior executives and approve all matters requiring approval by their respective members. While the Contractual Arrangements effectively grant us operating control of the Jin Ma Companies, it is possible that conflicts of interest related to these rights may occur between us and the Jin Ma Companies which may not be resolved to our benefit. 11 In addition, while the terms of the Contractual Arrangements provide that we are to be paid quarterly service fees equal to the net profit of the Jin Ma Companies, such payments have not been tendered to us and those funds are being retained by the Jin Ma Companies to fund their operations. At December 31, 2007 $1,309,455 is due to us by the Jin Ma Companies which remains unpaid as of the date hereof. Although we have no business and operations other than pursuant to the terms of the Contractual Arrangements, we incur operating expenses related to our public company reporting requirements including legal and accounting fees and other professional fees. Additionally, we incur interest expense on the 10% secured convertible debentures at an annual rate of 10% and it is possible that we will be required to pay substantially all of this interest in cash. While the Jin Ma Companies have represented to us that they intend to pay either all or a portion of the accrued fees and/or repay all or a portion of the advances so that we can meet our obligations under the 10% secured convertible debentures, there are no assurances that such amounts will be paid, or that any other conflicts of interest which may arise between our company and the Jin Ma Companies related to their obligation to pay the amounts due us will be resolved in our favor which could adversely impact our ability to pay our obligations and operating expenses in future periods. We have lent substantially all of the net proceeds from our recently completed financing to the Jin Ma Companies on an interest free, unsecured basis. If these amounts are not repaid, or if the Jin Ma Companies do not begin paying their quarterly service fees, it is possible that we will not have sufficient capital to pay our operating expenses which could result in a removal of our common stock from quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. We received net proceeds, after offering expenses, of approximately $1,993,000 from the first closing of the sale of our 10% secured convertible debentures. Upon the receipt of the funds, we transferred $1,800,000 to the Jin Ma Companies in the form of an unsecured, interest free advance for use by the Jin Ma Companies in their operations and to fund their registered capital requirements under PRC wholly-owned foreign enterprise rules. We retained the balance to fund our operating costs which are primarily professional fees incurred in complying with the audit and reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Upon receipt of additional funds from the second closing of the sale of our 10% secured convertible debentures, we intend to transfer additional funds to the Jin Ma Companies while retaining sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses for approximately 12 months. We do not have an understanding with the Jin Ma Companies regarding the repayment of the amounts advanced to that company. If these funds are not repaid, we may not have sufficient capital to pay our operating expenses. We may need additional capital, and the sale of additional shares or other equity securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders. We believe that our current working capital, which includes the amounts due us by the Jin Ma Companies, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the near future including the payment of interest on our outstanding debt. We may, however, determine to raise additional capital to lend to the Jin Ma Companies for use in expanding their operations. Our ability to presently raise capital, however, is somewhat limited by the terms of the 10% secured convertible debentures. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we should, however, raise additional equity capital, the potential sale of additional equity securities by us will result in additional dilution to our shareholders in an amount which is presently not determinable. It is likely that we will pay the interest on our 10% secured convertible debentures in shares of our common stock which will be dilutive to our shareholders. Under the terms of the 10% secured convertible debentures we are permitted to pay interest on those debentures in the form of shares of our common stock instead of cash if the shares are issued pursuant to an effective registration statement. Because we may not have sufficient funds available to make cash interest payments, we have included 325,191 shares of our common stock in the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part which may be issued to the holders of our 10% secured convertible debentures as interest in lieu of cash. The issuance of shares of our common stock as interest payment will be dilutive to our shareholders. 12 The Jin Ma Companies have engaged in a number of related party transactions which could adversely impact our company in future periods. Certain of these related party transactions violate provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. From time to time the Jin Ma Companies have advanced their CEO and companies related through common ownership by their CEO with funds for working capital. Mr. Yang, who is the CEO of the Jin Ma Companies, is also our CEO and principal shareholder. At December 31, 2007 these related entities owed the Jin Ma Companies approximately $837,000. These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and payable on demand. Through monthly payments these companies intend to repay these advances. While these loans were made prior to the closing date of the Share Exchange Agreement, as a result of the closing of that agreement we are now subject to the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which, in part, prohibits us from making loans to executive officers or directors. We have discontinued the practice of providing advances to our related parties. The Jin Ma Companies may not be able to maintain and/or comply with all applicable government regulation. The Jin Ma Companies are subject to extensive regulation by the central government and by the regional and local authorities of Inner Mongolia and Hohhot City where their business operations take place and their properties are located. We believe that the Jin Ma Companies are currently in substantial compliance with all material governmental laws and regulations and maintains all material permits and licenses relating to its operations in construction, hotel operation and real estate development. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the Jin Ma Companies will continue to be in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations, or whether they will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations. To the extent that new regulations are adopted, the Jin Ma Companies will be required to conform their activities in order to comply with such regulations. Failure by them to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject one or more of those companies to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Compliance with environmental regulations can be expensive, and noncompliance with these regulations may result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages and fines. As the business operations of the Jin Ma Companies generate noise, waste water, gaseous and other industrial wastes, those companies are required to comply with all national and local regulations regarding protection of the environment. We believe that the Jin Ma Companies are in compliance with present environmental protection requirements and to date it has not incurred any costs associated with compliance with these environmental regulations. However, if more stringent regulations are adopted in the future, the costs of compliance with these new regulations could be substantial. If one or more of these companies should fail to comply with present or future environmental regulations, however, such company may be required to pay substantial fines, suspend production or cease operations. Any failure by the Jin Ma Companies to control the use of, or to restrict adequately the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject those companies to potentially significant monetary damages and fines or suspensions in their business operations which could have an adverse impact on their business and operations in future periods. The Jin Ma Companies lack of property and general liability insurance. The Jin Ma Companies are self-insured, and as such do not carry any property insurance, general liability insurance, nor any other insurance that covers the risks of their business operations. As a result, any material loss or damage to its properties or other assets, or personal injuries arising from its business operations would have a material adverse affect on its financial condition and operations. Because the Jin Ma Companies are dependent upon a few major customers for substantially all of its current sales, the loss of any one of them would reduce our revenues, liquidity and hinder our ability to be profitable. 13 Jim Ma Construction is dependent on revenues from several customers. One construction segment customer provided 51% of our total revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2007 and at December 31, 2007 that customer had an accounts receivable balance of $1,648,526. For the year ended June 30, 2007 two customers provided 56% and 15% of our revenues and at June 30, 2007, we had $ 3,929,793 of accounts receivable due from these customers. Any disruption in the relationships between the Jin Ma Companies and one or more of these customers, or any significant variance in the magnitude or the timing of construction projects from any one of these customers, may result in decreases in our results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. Any such adverse operating results will likely decrease the market price of our common stock. Risks Relating to Construction Operations If Jin Ma Construction is unable to accurately estimate and control its contract costs and timelines, then it may incur losses on contracts, which may result in decreases in its operating margins and in a significant reduction or elimination of profits. Revenues from Jin Ma Construction represent a significant portion of the total revenues of the Jin Ma Companies. If Jin Ma Construction does not control its contract costs, it may be unable to maintain positive operating margins or experience operating losses. Jin Ma Construction typically enter into one of three principal types of contracts with its clients: cost-plus-fee contracts, fixed-price contracts, and fixed-price contracts modified by incentive and penalty provisions. Under fixed-price contracts, it receives a fixed price regardless of what its actual costs will be. Consequently, it realizes a profit on fixed-price contracts only if it control its costs and prevents cost over-runs on the contracts. Under fixed-price contracts modified by incentive and penalty provisions, Jin Ma Construction is paid a fixed price that may be increased or decreased based on incentive and provisions in its contracts. Under cost-plus-fee contracts, which may be subject to contract ceiling amounts, Jin Ma Construction is reimbursed for allowable costs and fees, which may be fixed or performance-based. If its costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or any applicable regulations, it may not be reimbursed for all of its costs. Under each type of contract, if Jin Ma Construction is unable to estimate and control costs and/or project timelines, it may incur losses on its contracts, which may result in decreases in its operating margins and in a significant reduction or elimination of its profits. If Jin Ma Construction fails to timely complete, miss a required performance standard or otherwise fail to adequately perform on a project, then it may incur a loss on that project, which may affect its overall profitability. Jin Ma Construction may commit to a client that it will complete a project by a scheduled date. It may also commit that a project, when completed, will achieve specified performance standards. If the project is not completed by the scheduled date or subsequently fails to meet required performance standards, Jin Ma Construction may either incur significant additional costs or be held responsible for the costs incurred by the client to rectify damages due to late completion or failure to achieve the required performance standards. The uncertainty of the timing of a project can present difficulties in planning the amount of personnel needed for the project. If the project is delayed or canceled, Jin Ma Construction may bear the cost of an underutilized workforce that was dedicated to fulfilling the project. In addition, performance of projects can be affected by a number of factors beyond its control, including unavoidable delays from weather conditions, unavailability of vendor materials, changes in the project scope of services requested by clients or labor disruptions. In some cases, should Jin Ma Construction fail to meet required performance standards, it may also be subject to agreed-upon financial damages, which are determined by the contract. To the extent that these events occur, the total costs of the project could exceed our estimates and Jin Ma Construction could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, incur a loss on that project, which may affect its overall profitability. Jin Ma Constructions use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting could result in reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenues and profits. 14 A substantial portion of Jin Ma Constructions revenues and profits are measured and recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which is discussed further in Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. Jin Ma Constructions use of this method results in recognition of revenues and profits ratably over the life of a contract, based generally on the proportion of costs incurred to date to total costs expected to be incurred for the entire project. The effect of revisions to revenues and estimated costs is recorded when the amounts are known or can be reasonably estimated. Such revisions could occur in any period and their effects could be material. Although Jin Ma Construction has historically made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion of long-term engineering, program and construction management or construction contracts in process, the uncertainties inherent in the estimating process make it possible for actual costs to vary materially from estimates, including reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits. Jin Ma Constructions future revenues depend on its ability to consistently bid and win new contracts and renew existing contracts and, therefore, its failure to effectively obtain future contracts could adversely affect its profitability. Jin Ma Constructions future revenues and overall results of operations require it to successfully bid on new contracts and renew existing contracts. Contract proposals and negotiations are complex and frequently involve a lengthy bidding and selection process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, financing arrangements and required governmental approvals. If negative market conditions arise, or if Jin Ma Construction fails to secure adequate financial arrangements or the required governmental approval, it may not be able to pursue particular projects, which could adversely affect our profitability. Jin Ma Construction may be subject to significant potential liabilities as a result of construction defect, product liability and warranty claims made against it. Through Jin Ma Construction, we may be subject to construction defect, product liability and related warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common to the real estate development and the construction industries and can be costly. With respect to certain general liability exposures, including construction defect and product liability, interpretation of underlying current and future trends, assessment of claims and the related liability and reserve estimation process is highly judgmental due to the complex nature of these exposures, with each exposure exhibiting unique circumstances. Furthermore, once claims are asserted for construction defects, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the assertion of these claims will expand geographically. Jin Ma Construction may not have sufficient funds available or adequate to cover any liability for damages, the cost of repairs, and/or the expense of litigation surrounding such claims, and future claims may arise out of uninsurable events or circumstances not covered by insurance and not subject to effective indemnification agreements with its subcontractors. Reliance on independent contractors in providing various services creates risks and Jin Ma Construction is exposed to various risks in relation to contractors performance. Jin Ma Construction engages independent third party contractors, through open tenders, to provide various services including construction, piling and foundation, building and fitting-out works, interior decoration and installation of elevators. Although it is Jin Ma Constructions strategy and policy to select reputable independent third party contractors with positive track records in most cases and supervises the construction progress, there is no assurance that the services rendered by any of these independent third party contractors will always be satisfactory or match the targeted quality level required by it and there may not be sufficient availability of and satisfactory performance by these unaffiliated third-party subcontractors in the markets in which it operates. Additionally, Jin Ma Construction is exposed to the risk that a contractor may require additional capital in excess of the cost they tendered to complete a contractual property development and Jin Ma Construction may have to provide such additional capital. Furthermore, there is risk that contractors may experience financial or other difficulties which may affect their ability to carry out construction works, thus delaying the completion of Jin Ma Constructions property developments or resulting in additional costs for it. Any of these factors could adversely affect its revenues and reputation. 15 Risks Relating to Hotel Operation Jin Ma Hotel is subject to all the operating risks common to the hotel industry. Operating risks common to the hotel industry which may affect the Jin Ma Hotel include:  changes in general economic conditions in China and specifically in the Inner Mongolia region;  impact of terrorist activity including threatened terrorist activity and heightened travel security measures instituted in response thereto;  domestic and international political and geopolitical conditions;  travelers fears of exposures to contagious diseases;  decreases in the demand for transient rooms and related lodging services, including a reduction in business travel as a result of general economic conditions;  restrictive changes in regulations or in health, safety and environmental laws, rules and regulations and other governmental and regulatory action;  changes in travel patterns;  changes in operating costs including energy, labor costs, food costs, workers compensation and health-care related costs, insurance and unanticipated costs such as acts of nature and their consequences;  the availability of capital to allow Jin Ma Hotel to fund renovations and investments;  foreign exchange fluctuations; and  the financial condition of the airline industry and the impact on air travel. As these risks are outside the control of the Jin Ma Hotel, it may be unable to take actions which might eliminate or mitigate the risk to it. The occurrences of one or more of the foregoing could result in a significant decline in the revenues from Jim Ma Hotel which would adversely impact our results of operations in future periods. Jin Ma Hotels costs and expenses may remain constant or increase even if its revenues decline. If the Jin Ma Hotel is unable to maintain its good condition and attractive appearance, the hotel occupancy rates may decline. A significant portion of the operating costs of the Jin Ma Hotel are fixed. Accordingly, a decrease in its revenues could result in a disproportionately higher decrease in its earnings because its operating costs and expenses are unlikely to decrease proportionately. The hotel industry is seasonal in nature. Thus, during Jin Ma Hotels slow seasons, its expenses do not vary as significantly as changes in occupancy and revenues, since it is required to continue to pay salaries, make regular repairs, maintenance and renovations and invest in other capital improvements throughout the year to maintain the attractiveness of the hotel. The property development and renovation costs may increase as a result of increasing costs of materials. In addition, although during fiscal year 2006, the Jin Ma Hotel completed a renovation in the future it will be required to undertake ongoing renovations and other leasehold improvements, including periodic replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment, in order to maintain the hotels good condition and attractive appearance. If it does not make needed investments and improvements, it could lose its market share to its competitors and the hotel occupancy rates may decline. However, the Jin Ma Hotel has a limited ability to pass increased costs to customers through room rate increases. This creates an ongoing need for cash to the extent the Jin Ma Hotel cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations, funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. Therefore, its costs and expenses may remain constant or increase even if its revenues decline. Accordingly, its financial results may be sensitive to the cost and availability of funds. The financial and operating performance of the Jin Ma Hotel may be adversely affected by epidemics, natural disasters and other catastrophes. 16 In early 2003, several economies in Asia, including China, were affected by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. During May 2003 and June of 2003, many businesses in China were closed by the PRC government to prevent transmission of SARS. In addition, some Asian countries, including China, have recently encountered incidents of the H5N1 strain of bird flu, or avian flu. This disease, which originally spread through poultry populations, is capable in some circumstances of being transmitted to humans and is often fatal. Losses caused by epidemics, natural disasters and other catastrophes, including SARS, avian flu, earthquakes or typhoons, are either uninsurable or too expensive to justify insuring against in China. In the event an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, the Jin Ma Companies could lose all or a portion of the capital it has invested in the Jin Ma Hotel, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel. In that event, the Jin Ma Companies might nevertheless remain obligated for any financial obligations related to the hotel. Similarly, terrorist activity including threats of terrorist activity, travel-related accidents, as well as geopolitical uncertainty and international conflict, will affect travel and may in turn have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations for the Jin Ma Hotel. In addition, the Jin Ma Hotel may not be adequately prepared in contingency planning or recovery capability in relation to a major incident or crisis, and as a result its operational continuity may be adversely affected and its reputation may be harmed. Risks Relating to Real Estate Development Operations There are uncertainties with Chinese real estate law. For the development of a new commercial real estate project, the developer must first obtain land use rights. Land use rights can be granted through bidding, auction and listings. The developer then enters into a land use right grant contract with the relevant government authority. The transferor and transferee must enter into a land use right transfer contract and file the executed contract with the appropriate government bureau, which will then issue a new land use certificate in the name of the transferee. In May 2002, the Ministry of Land and Resources issued a regulation regarding the land use right transfer. Whereas in the past, private parties were able to transfer land use rights by mutual agreement, this practice was prohibited by the new regulation. Under the new scheme, any procurement of land for business purposes can only be effected through bidding, auction and listing on an authorized exchange floor. The long term value of Chinese land rights are still quite uncertain, and their rights not the kind of secure investment that would lead a lender, as might happen in American, to rely primarily on the land value and look beyond the individual ability of a borrower to repay the debt. Chinese banks, for example, rarely make construction loans because in theory they cannot lend more than the value of the land that is their security at the time of the loan. The Chinese deal with this problem by signing presale contracts whereby the end user pays all of the consideration before the building is commenced. Effectively, the users finance the sellers construction. Users borrow the money from the banks under arrangements which later will morph into mortgage loans when there is something to which the mortgage can attach. Usually the developer must deposit the purchase proceeds in the bank and the bank monitors the expenditures. Before a presale method can be legally adopted, the developer of the project normally must have obtained a:  land use right certificate,  planning permit for construction use of land,  planning permit for the construction project,  certificate of commencement of construction, and  a permit for presale of commercial housing. The failure of Jin Ma Real Estate to comply with one or more of these procedures and regulations could adversely impact its ability to continue its business of developing, marketing and selling high-quality, affordable homes in apartment high-rises targeted at Chinese middle income families. 17 Jin Ma Real Estates results of operation and financial condition are greatly affected by the performance of the real estate market. Jin Ma Real Estates development activities are subject to numerous factors beyond its control, including local real estate market conditions, both where its properties are located and in areas where its potential customers reside, substantial existing and potential competition, general national, regional and local economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates and mortgage availability and changes in demographic conditions. Real estate markets have historically been subject to strong periodic cycles driven by numerous factors beyond the control of market participants. Real estate investments often cannot easily be converted into cash and market values may be adversely affected by these economic circumstances, market fundamentals, competition and demographic conditions. Because of the effect these factors have on real estate values, it is difficult to predict with certainty the level of future sales or sales prices that will be realized for individual assets. Jin Ma Real Estates operations are also dependent upon the availability and cost of mortgage financing for potential customers, to the extent they finance their purchases, and for buyers of the potential customers existing residences. Unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could hurt occupancy or rental rates. Market and economic conditions may significantly affect rental rates. Occupancy and rental rates in Jin Ma Real Estates market, in turn, may significantly affect its profitability and its ability to satisfy its financial obligations. The risks that may affect conditions in Jin Ma Real Estates market include the following:  the economic climate, which may be adversely impacted by industry slowdowns and other factors;  local conditions, such as oversupply of office and residential space and the demand for office and residential space;  the inability or unwillingness of tenants to pay their current rent or rent increases; and  competition from other available office and residential buildings and changes in market rental rates. Real estate development is subject to timing, budgeting and other risks. Jin Ma Real Estate intends to expand its real estate development activities, as suitable opportunities arise, taking into consideration the general economic climate. New project development has a number of risks, including risks associated with:  construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs;  receipt of required governmental permits and authorizations;  development costs incurred for projects that are not pursued to completion;  so-called acts of God such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods or fires that could adversely impact a project;  defects in design or construction that may result in additional costs to remedy or require all or a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the situation;  ability to raise capital;  governmental restrictions on the nature or size of a project or timing of completion; and  shortages of materials or skilled labor. We cannot assure you that any development project will be completed on time or within budget or at all. Jin Ma Real Estates cost estimates and projected completion dates for development and construction of new building projects may change significantly as the projects progress. A delay in scheduled openings will delay Jin Ma Real Estates receipt of increased sale revenues. If it does not successfully address its increased management needs or it is otherwise are unable to manage its growth effectively, its operating results could be materially and adversely affected. 18 While Jin Ma Real Estate attempts to anticipate consumer preferences and location-related concerns, it is subject to the inherent uncertainty of market acceptance. Jin Ma Real Estate is currently selling its developed properties principally in Hohhot. Achieving market acceptance for its properties, particularly in new markets, will require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant funds. There is substantial risk that any new markets may not accept or be as receptive to its properties. Market acceptance of Jin Ma Real Estates current and proposed properties will depend, in large part, upon its ability to inform potential customers that the distinctive characteristics of its properties make them superior to competitive properties and justify their pricing. There can be no assurance that its current and proposed properties will be accepted by consumers or that any of its current or proposed properties will be able to compete effectively against other properties. Lack of market acceptance of Jin Ma Real Estate properties would have a material adverse effect on it. Jin Ma Real Estate is required by market practice to guarantee the mortgages of its customers. In accordance with market practice in China, Jin Ma Real Estate is required to provide guarantees during the development phase to the banks in respect of mortgages offered to the property buyers until submission of the relevant real estate ownership certificates and certificates of other interests in the property unit by the relevant property buyers to the mortgage bank. If a property buyer defaults under the loan and Jin Ma Real Estate is required, during the guarantee period, to repay all debt owed by the defaulting property buyer to the mortgage bank, the mortgage bank will assign its rights under the loan and the mortgage to Jin Ma Real Estate and, subject to registration, it will have full recourse to the property. In line with industry practice, Jin Ma Real Estate does not conduct independent credit checks on the property buyers but relies instead on the credit checks conducted by the mortgage banks. For financial reporting purposes, the sale of a property unit is not recognized until title has passed and Jin Ma Real Estate is released from its loan guarantee on the unit. Mortgage interest rates may increase, cooling demand for Jin Ma Real Estates properties. The provision of mortgage facilities to property buyers is considered to have created increasing demand for properties in the China. The recent increases in bank mortgage interest rates, however, may significantly increase the cost of mortgage financing to property buyers, thus reducing the attractiveness of mortgages as a source of financing property purchases and, accordingly, adversely affecting the affordability of residential properties. The Chinese government has also raised the reserve requirements for banks, as well as other conditions, which may make mortgage financing unavailable or unattractive to the potential property buyers. The practice of pre-selling developments may expose Jin Ma Real Estate to substantial liabilities. The existing common practices by property developers to pre-sale properties while still under construction in China involves certain risks. For example, Jin Ma Real Estate may fail to complete a property development which may have been fully or partially pre-sold. In such circumstances, it could find itself liable to purchasers of pre-sold units for losses suffered by them. There can be no assurance that these losses would not exceed the purchase price paid in respect of the pre-sold units. In addition, if a pre-sold property development is not completed on time, the purchasers of pre-sold units may be entitled to compensation for late delivery. If the delay extends beyond a certain period, the purchasers may even be entitled to terminate the pre-sale agreement and claim for damages. If Jin Ma Real Estate is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or other sources, it may find it necessary to curtail its development activities. 19 Significant capital resources are required to fund Jin Ma Real Estates development expenditures. We cannot guarantee that sufficient capital can be generated to develop every one of Jin Ma Real Estates projects by way of only presale revenue, and there can be no assurance that it will otherwise obtain sufficient funds from other sources to meet the expected development plans for its properties. We cannot guarantee Jin Ma Real Estates ability to obtain bank loans and credit facilities and renewals of existing borrowings from financial institutions on maturity under favorable terms and conditions. Changes in interest rates on its borrowings will also affect its financing costs and consequently its results of operations. Dependence on natural resources and construction materials in China. The major materials of the real estate industry are land and construction materials. Land supply is strictly controlled by the Chinese government. The continuing land consumption by the real estate industry in China will make it continually difficult for real estate developers to obtain land which may lead to substantial increases in land prices, which will in turn increase development costs. In addition, although the costs of some construction materials have declined in recent years, the price of new materials due to the implementation of environmental laws may increase further. The effect of prices of land and construction materials makes Jin Ma Real Estates operating results unpredictable. Risks Related to Doing Business in China Adverse changes in economic and political policies of the PRC government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect our business indirectly. Because we have no business or operations other than the Contractual Arrangements with the Jin Ma Companies, our business operations and financial position are subject, to a significant degree, to the economic, political and legal developments in China. Chinas economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including with respect to the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Chinas government started implementing its economic reform policy in 1978, which has enabled China economy to gradually transform from a planned economy to a socialist market economy. In 1993, the concept of the socialist market economy was introduced into the Constitution of China, and the country has since accelerated development of a market economy. A noteworthy phenomenon in the recent development of China economy is that non-state owned enterprises such as private enterprises play an increasingly important role in China economy and the degree of direct control by China government over the economy is gradually declining. While the PRC economy has experienced significant growth in the past 20 years, growth has been uneven across different regions and among various economic sectors of China. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources. While some of these measures benefit the overall PRC economy, they may also have a negative effect on us. For example, the Jin Ma Companies results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in environmental, health, labor or tax regulations that are applicable to it. The PRC government also exercises significant control over Chinas economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. For example, China government has been taking macro-economic austerity measures to suppress inflation and curb the pace of economic growth since July 1993. These measures include raising interest rates, tightening credit supply, delaying implementation of certain reform policies on pricing, enhancing financial supervision as well as tightening control on the granting of approval for property and infrastructure projects. However, since 1998, there has been deflation in China economy and the current economic policies of China mainly focus on stimulating consumption and expansion of domestic demand. Since late 2003, the PRC government implemented a number of measures, such as increasing the Peoples Bank of Chinas statutory deposit reserve ratio and imposing commercial bank lending guidelines that had the effect of restricting loans to certain industries. 20 While the Chinese government has not reversed its economic reform policies since 1978, any significant material changes in the social, political and economic conditions of China may cause its government to change its economic reform policies and thus the operations and profits of the Jin Ma Companies may be materially affected. Any adverse impact on its operations and profits would likewise adversely impact our company. Chinese laws and regulations governing the Jin Ma Companies current business operations and the Contractual Arrangements are sometimes vague and uncertain. Any changes in such Chinese laws and regulations may have a material and adverse effect on our business. Chinas legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes, in which system decided legal cases have little value as precedents unlike the common law system prevalent in the United States. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of Chinese laws and regulations, including but not limited to the laws and regulations governing the business of the Jin Ma Companies, or the enforcement and performance of its arrangements with customers in the event of the imposition of statutory liens, death, bankruptcy and criminal proceedings. The Chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws, and considerable progress has been made in introducing laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade. However, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published cases and judicial interpretation and their lack of force as precedents, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new Chinese laws or regulations may have on the businesses of the Jin Ma Companies. In addition, we do not know if the Contractual Arrangements will be upheld if challenged by the Chinese government. If the relevant authorities find us in violation of Chinese laws or regulations, they would have broad discretion in dealing with such a violation, including, without limitation, levying fines, revoking the business and other licenses of the Jin Ma Companies, requiring the Jin Ma Companies to restructure the Contractual Arrangements, and/or requiring that that the Jin Ma Companies discontinue the Contractual Arrangements. Governmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment. The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We are dependent upon the payment of the fees to us by the Jin Ma Company for our revenues. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of the Jin Ma Companies to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay the quarterly services fees to us. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the Chinese State Administration of Foreign Regulation (SAFE), by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, for most capital account items, approval from appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents the Jin Ma Companies from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy its currency demands, it may not be able to pay the quarterly service fees to us. If we do not receive those fees, we will not have the ability to pay our operating expenses, including those related to our status as public company, and we could be forced to cease our operations. It may be difficult for shareholders to enforce any judgment obtained in the United States against our managements, which may limit the remedies otherwise available to our shareholders. 21 The majority of our directors and officers are nationals or residents of China. As a result, it may be difficult for our shareholders to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of China would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or such officers and/or directors predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities law of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in China against us or such persons predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. Although we believe we comply with current PRC regulations, we cannot assure you that the PRC government would agree that these operating arrangements comply with PRC licensing, registration or other regulatory requirements, with existing policies or with requirements or policies that may be adopted in the future. If the PRC government determines that we do not comply with applicable law, it could revoke our business and operating licenses, require us to discontinue or restrict our operations, restrict our right to collect revenues, require us to restructure our operations, impose additional conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply, impose restrictions on our business operations or on our customers, or take other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business. Risks Related To Ownership of our Securities and this Offering We may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls in the PRC. PRC companies have historically not adopted a Western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which includes strong corporate governance, internal controls and, database, financial and other control systems. As a result, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards. Therefore, we may, in turn, experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure on our part may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls which could impact the reliability of our financial statements which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Certain of our officers and directors own a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock, which enables them to influence many significant corporate actions and in certain circumstances may prevent a change in control that would otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders. At March 31, 2008, our directors and executive officers control approximately 61% of our outstanding shares of common stock. These shareholders, acting together, could have a substantial impact on matters requiring the vote of the shareholders, including the election of our directors and most of our corporate actions. This control could delay, defer or prevent others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change in our control, even if these actions would benefit our shareholders and us and this control could adversely affect the voting and other rights of our other shareholders. The exercise of outstanding warrants, the issuance of shares of our common stock as interest on the outstanding notes and the possible conversion of those outstanding notes will be dilutive to our existing shareholders. At March 31, 2008 we had 52,544,603 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and the following securities which are convertible or exercisable into shares of our common stock were outstanding:  9,520,352 shares of our common stock issuable upon the possible conversion of $3,275,000 principal amount 10% secured convertible debentures, based upon a conversion of $0.344 per share;  up to an additional 944,985 shares of our common stock which we may issue the debenture holders as interest payments; and  9,520,352 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of common stock purchase warrants with an exercise price of $0.50 per share. 22 The issuance of the shares as interest payment, the exercise of the warrants and/or the conversion of the debentures may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock and will have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders. We have not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of which, shareholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters. Recent Federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address board of directors independence, audit committee oversight, and the adoption of a code of ethics. Although we have adopted a Code of Financial Ethics, we have not adopted any of these other corporate governance measures and, since our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, we are not required to do so. We have not adopted corporate governance measures such as an audit or other independent committees of our board of directors as we presently do not have any independent directors. It is possible that if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, shareholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. For example, in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees may be made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions. We may be exposed to potential risks relating to our internal controls over financial reporting and our ability to have those controls attested to by our independent auditors. As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX 404), the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules requiring small business issuers, such as our company, to include a report of management on the companys internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2007. Presently, unless the phase in period of this rule is delayed an additional year as is presently being contemplated by the SEC, we will become subject to compliance with SOX 404 for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2008. In addition, for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements must also attest to and report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as well as the operating effectiveness of our internal controls. While we have yet to begin evaluating our internal control systems in order to allow our management to report on, and our independent auditors attest to, our internal controls, as presently required, we expect to expend significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by SOX 404. Given our lack of internal accounting personnel as well as the challenges we face as the most significant portion of our operations are presently located in the PRC, it is likely that we will identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls. In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner or we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors with respect to our internal controls, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and our ability to obtain financing as needed could suffer. 23 If the selling security holders all elect to sell their shares of our common stock at the same time, the market price of our shares may decrease. It is possible that the selling security holders will offer all of the shares for sale. Further, because it is possible that a significant number of shares could be sold at the same time hereunder, the sales, or the possibility thereof, may have a depressive effect on the market price of our common stock. Because our stock currently trades below $5.00 per share, and is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, our stock is considered a penny stock which can adversely affect its liquidity. As the trading price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share, our common stock is considered a penny stock, and trading in our common stock is subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under this rule, broker/dealers who recommend low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special sales practice requirements. The broker/dealer must make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written consent prior to the transaction. SEC regulations also require additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a penny stock, including the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and its associated risks. These requirements severely limit the liquidity of securities in the secondary market because few broker or dealers are likely to undertake these compliance activities. In addition to the applicability of the penny stock rules, other risks associated with trading in penny stocks could also be price fluctuations and the lack of a liquid market.

The reported high and low sales prices for the common stock as reported on the OTCBB are shown below for the periods indicated. The quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, markdown or commission, and may not represent actual transactions.

As of March 31, 2008, there were approximately 270 record owners of our common stock. Dividend Policy We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. Subject to the terms of the 10% secured convertible debentures, payment of dividends is within the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend, among other factors, upon our earnings, capital requirements and our operating and financial condition. Under Florida law, we may declare and pay dividends on our capital stock either out of our surplus, as defined in the relevant Florida statutes, or if there is no such surplus, out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. If, however, the capital of our company, computed in accordance with the relevant Florida statutes, has been diminished by depreciation in the value of our property, or by losses, or otherwise, to an amount less than the aggregate amount of the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets, we are prohibited from declaring and paying out of such net profits any dividends upon any shares of our capital stock until the deficiency in the amount of capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets shall have been repaired. So long as the 10% secured convertible debentures are outstanding, however, we are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock. 25 CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our capitalization as of December 31, 2007. The table should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. December 31, 2007 (unaudited) Long term liabilities, net: $ 1,620,693 Preferred stock, $0.0001 par value, 20,000,000 shares authorized; none issued and outstanding 0 Common stock, $0.0001 par value, 300,000,000 shares authorized, 52,219,254 shares issued and outstanding 5,222 Additional paid-in capital 4,397,030 Non-controlling interest in variable interest entities 5,959,807 Statutory reserve 752,931 Retained earnings 4,766,825 Other comprehensive gain - foreign currency 1,105,673 Total shareholders equity $ 16,987,488 Total capitalization $ 18,608,181 USE OF PROCEEDS We will not receive any proceeds upon the sale of shares by the selling security holders. Any proceeds that we receive from the exercise of the outstanding warrants, if exercised on a cash basis, will be used by us for general working capital. The actual allocation of proceeds realized from the exercise of the warrants will depend upon the amount and timing of such exercises, our operating revenues and cash position at such time and our working capital requirements. There can be no assurances that any of the outstanding warrants will be exercised on a cash basis, if at all. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION Overview Prior to June 29, 2007, we were a development stage company attempting to implement our business plan to become a fully integrated online provider that linked the supply and demand sides of the ground trucking industry. On June 29, 2007, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Gold Horse Nevada whereby we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Gold Horse Nevada in exchange for newly-issued shares of our common stock to the Gold Horse Nevada shareholders. Gold Horse Nevada conducts its business operations through its wholly owned subsidiary Global Rise which is a party to the Contractual Arrangements with the Jin Ma Companies. On the closing of the share exchange, Gold Horse Nevada was deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the financial statements included in this prospectus are those of Gold Horse Nevada for all periods prior to our acquisition of Gold Horse Nevada on June 29, 2007, and the financial statements of the consolidated companies from the acquisition date forward. 26 Neither Gold Horse International nor its subsidiaries Gold Horse Nevada, Global Rise or IMTD are engaged in any business or operations other than pursuant to the terms of the various Contractual Arrangements with the Jin Ma Companies as described elsewhere in this prospectus. As such, we are completely dependent on the Contractual Arrangements. We do not generate any revenues and have no assets. Pursuant to the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46R  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities , under generally accepted accounting principles the Jin Ma Companies which are deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs) we are required to consolidate the financial statements of the Jin Ma Companies with our financial statements. Accordingly, and as described elsewhere in this prospectus, the assets and liabilities at December 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007 and 2006 and the results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 are those of the Jin Ma Companies. All of those assets and operations are located in the PRC and the Contractual Arrangements are subject to enforcement under the laws of the PRC. If we are unable to enforce any legal rights we may have under these contracts or otherwise, our ability to continue as a going concern is in jeopardy. In addition, the terms of these contracts expire in August 2016 and there are no assurances these agreements will be renewed. If the Contractual Arrangements are not renewed or are significantly modified, unless we have expanded our business and operations, of which there are no assurances, we will in all likelihood be forced to cease our operations. When used in this section, and except as may be set forth otherwise, the terms we, us, ours, and similar terms includes Gold Horse International and its subsidiaries Gold Horse Nevada, Global Rise and IMTD as well as the Jin Ma Companies. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and present the financial statements of the Company and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries including VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Gold Horse International and our wholly owned subsidiaries and our variable interest entities Jin Ma Construction, Jin Ma Hotel and Jin Ma Real Estate. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. We have adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities  (FIN 46R), an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. FIN 46R requires a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIEs residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which we, through contractual arrangements, bear the risks of, and enjoy the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entities, and therefore we are the primary beneficiary of these entities. 27 Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in 2007 and 2006 include the allowance for doubtful accounts and the useful life of property and equipment, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings. Accounts and other receivables We have a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We periodically review our accounts receivable and other receivables to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. On December 31, 2007, we had established, based on a review of the outstanding accounts receivable balances, an allowance for doubtful accounts in the amount of $174,669 on current accounts receivable and $845,522 on long-term accounts receivable. Long-term accounts receivable represents amounts due from various government agencies, who historically may take from six months to over one year to pay. Additionally, at December 31, 2007, we established, based on a review of outstanding other receivable balances, an allowance for doubtful accounts in the amount of $859,257. Inventories Inventories, consisting of construction materials and consumable goods related to our operations are stated at the lower of cost or market utilizing the first-in, first-out method. Real estate held for sale We capitalize as real estate held for sale the direct construction and development costs, property taxes, interest incurred on costs related to land under development and other related costs (i.e. engineering, surveying, landscaping, etc.) until the property reaches its intended use. At December 31, 2007, real estate held for sale amounted to $534,512. Advances from customers Advances from customers at December 31, 2007 of $164,318 consist of prepayments from third party customers for construction and real estate transactions to ensure sufficient funds are available to complete the real estate and construction projects. We will recognize the deposits as revenue upon transfer of title to the buyer, in compliance with our revenue recognition policy. 28 Revenue recognition We follow the guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 for revenue recognition. In general, we record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The following policies reflect specific criteria for the various revenues streams:  Real estate sales which primarily involve the sale of multi-family homes and community environments are reported in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. Profit from the sales of development properties, less 5% business tax, is recognized by the full accrual method when the sale is consummated. A sale is not considered consummated until:  the parties are bound by the terms of a contract,  all consideration has been exchanged,  any permanent financing of which the seller is responsible has been arranged,  all conditions precedent to closing have been performed,  the seller does not have substantial continuing involvement with the property, and  the usual risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. Sales transactions not meeting all the conditions of the full accrual method are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting. Under the deposit method, all costs are capitalized as incurred, and payments received from the buyer are recorded as a deposit liability (reflected as advances from customers in our consolidated balance sheets). Revenue from the performance of general contracting, construction management and design-building services is recognized upon completion of the service. Revenue primarily derived from hotel operations, including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales, is recognized when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. In accounting for long-term engineering and construction-type contracts, we follow the provisions of the AICPAs Statement of Position 81-1 Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts . We recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion. Contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised. This method of revenue recognition requires we prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule, the cost of materials and labor, and productivity; and the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes, and achievement of contractual performance standards which may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. The asset, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability, billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, represents billings in excess of revenues recognized. 29 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (SFAS 109). The interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entitys financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. It prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which provides guidance for how companies should measure fair value when required to use a fair value measurement for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP). SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on its financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158 (SFAS 158), Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). This statement requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity. This statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions. We will be required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, or fiscal 2009 for us. Since we do not contribute toward any pension plan for our employees, the initial recognition and required disclosures required by SFAS 158 are not applicable at this time. In December 2006, FASB Staff Position No. EITF 00-19-2, Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements, was issued. The FSP specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement, whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement, should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We believe that our current accounting is consistent with the FSP. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 , under which entities will now be permitted to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS 157. We are currently assessing the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS 159 will have on our financial statements. 30 Comparison of Three Months and Six Months Ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006.

Overall, for the six months ended December 31, 2007, our net revenues increased $4,727,511 or approximately 36% from the comparable period in fiscal 2007. The increase in revenues in the six month period was mainly due to increased activity in our construction operations. During the fiscal 2008 periods we reported increase in revenues in that segment of approximately 30%, from the comparable periods in fiscal 2007. Jin Ma Construction completed the Ta Bu Ban residential apartment project during the six months ended December 31, 2007 and began two new projects during the period. Revenues for our hotel operations increased approximately 28% for the six months ended December 31, 2007 from the comparable periods in fiscal 2007. We believe the increased occupancy was primarily the result of an increase in tourism resulting from the completion of the Muslim Scenic Route through Hohhot City. Finally, revenues for our real estate development operation increased approximately 210% in the six months ended December 31, 2007 from the comparable period in fiscal 2007 due to the sale of apartments from our inventory of completed projects. Cost of Sales . Overall, cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively constant for the six months ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2006. Cost of sales from our construction operation as a percentage of revenues from that segment increased less than 1% for each of the six months ended December 31, 2007 from the comparable periods in fiscal 2007 in conjunction with the additional projects that Jin Ma Construction added to its roster during fiscal 2006. Additionally, increases in cost of sales from our construction operation were partly attributable to increases in costs for building supplies, labor costs, and other costs incurred on our projects. Cost of sales for the hotel segment as a percentage of revenues for our hotel operation increased approximately 3% for the six months ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2006, which was primarily attributable to an increase in food costs. Cost of sales for our real estate development operation as a percentage of net revenues for that segment decreased approximately 12% for the six months ended December 31, 2007 from the comparable fiscal 2007 periods. We started to generate revenues from this segment during the three months ended December 31 2006 period and a higher cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues is associated with initial start up costs. Gross Profit. Overall, gross profit increased approximately 38% for the six months ended December 31, 2007 from the six months ended December 31, 2006. Operating Expenses . For the six months ended December 31, 2007, overall operating expenses decreased approximately 26% as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2006. These decreases were mainly due to a decrease in hotel operating expenses, bad debt and general and administrative expenses offset by the increases in salaries and employee benefits and depreciation expense as discussed below. Hotel Operating Expenses . Hotel operating expenses decreased by approximately 61% for the six months ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2006. Hotel operating expenses were approximately 3% of revenues from this segment for the six months ended December 31, 2007 as compared to approximately 12%for the six months ended December 31, 2006 due to the write off of supply inventory in the 2006 period. Bad Debt Expense . For the six months ended December 31, 2007, bad debt expense amounted to $307,691 as compared to $831,832 for the six months ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of $524,141 or approximately 63%. We have a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts and other receivables. We periodically review our accounts receivable and other receivables to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We are currently reviewing our credit policies and began aggressively pursuing overdue accounts. 32 Salaries and Employee Benefits . During the fiscal 2008 periods our salaries and employee benefits increased approximately 233% as compared from the comparable period in fiscal 2007, as we increased the number of our employees. These increases included increases in our accounting staff and administrative staff to meet the needs of becoming a public entity as well as increases in real estate sales staff as our sales in this segment increased. Depreciation and Amortization . For the six months ended December 31, 2007, depreciation and amortization increased approximately 70%, respectively, from the comparable periods in fiscal 2007 relating to the acquisition of construction equipment in the current period. General and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses consist of office expenses and supplies, utilities, telephone and communications, maintenance and automobile expense as well as expenses incurred to operate our company in the US. While general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2007 increased significantly from the three months ended December 31, 2006 as described below, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 30% for the six months ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2006. The overall period to period decrease was attributable to a significant decrease in general and administrative expenses in our hotel operations as a result of efficient hotel and restaurant management and proficient trained employees which more than offset the interim increase. Total Other Expense . Total other expense increased approximately 142% for the six month ended December 31, 2007 from the comparable period in fiscal 2007. The increase is primarily attributable to interest expense related to the sale of our 10% secured convertible debentures in November 2007. Net Income . Net income increased 149% from a net income of $525,106 for the six months ended December 31, 2006 to net income of $1,309,455 for the six months ended December 31, 2007. The increase for the six month ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the comparable periods in fiscal 2006 were due primarily to revenues and gross profits and the overall decrease in operating expenses as described above. This translates to basic per common share of $0.03 and $0.01, and diluted net income per common share of $0.02 and $0.01, for the six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Comprehensive Income. For the six months ended December 31, 2007 we reported unrealized gain on foreign currency translation of $560,795 as compared to $192,621 for the six months ended December 31, 2006.

As described elsewhere herein, our functional currency is the Chinese Renminbi; however the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated and presented in U.S. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the period for revenues, costs, and expenses. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations and can have a significant effect on our financial statements. As a result of this non-cash gain, we reported comprehensive income of $1,870,250 for the six months ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $717,727 for comparable fiscal 2007 period. 33 Three months ended December 31, 2007 compared to three months ended December 31, 2006 Net Revenues . Overall, for the three months ended December 31, 2007, our net revenues increased $1,864,618 or approximately 29% from the comparable period in fiscal 2007. The increase in revenues in the three month period was mainly due to increased activity in our construction operations.

Jin Ma Construction completed the Ta Bu Ban residential apartment project during the six months ended December 31, 2007 and began two new projects during the period. Revenues for our hotel operations increased approximately 32% in the three months ended December 31, 2007 because of an increase in tourism resulting from the completion of the Muslim Scenic Route through Hohhot City. Finally, revenues for our real estate development operation decreased approximately 20% for the three months ended December 31, 2007 from the comparable period in fiscal 2007 due to fluctuations in the Chinese housing market.

The increase in revenues was mainly due to increased activity in our construction operations. Jin Ma Construction completed the Hohhot City Intermediate Peoples Court Legal Service Center project during fiscal 2006, and was retained as contractor in five construction projects, including the renovation of the administrative building for the Chifeng Area Land Tax Authority, which translated into an increase in revenues for our construction operation from $17,474,915 in fiscal 2006 to $21,615,061 in fiscal 2007. Revenues for our hotel operations increased slightly from $2,503,971 to $2,747,727, an increase of $243,256 or 9.7%, because of an increase in tourism resulting from the completion of the Muslim Scenic Route through Hohhot City, despite some disruption caused by our renovation efforts during the last two quarters of 2006. Revenues for our real estate development operation increased from $2,629,869 for fiscal 2006 to $3,959,518 for fiscal 2007, an increase of $1,329,649 or 50.6% due to the sale of apartments from our inventory of completed projects.

The increase of 22% in cost of sales in relation to the increase in revenues is in line with the increase in revenues from all three of our operating segments as noted above. Cost of sales from our construction operation increased from $15,232,045 to $18,178,472, an increase of 19%, in line with the increased revenue from the increased construction activities in conjunction with the additional projects that Jin Ma Construction added to its roster during fiscal 2006. Additionally, increases in cost of sales from our construction operation were partly attributable to increases in costs for building supplies, labor costs, and other costs incurred on our projects. Cost of sales for our hotel operation increased from $1,264,664 to $1,440,978, an increase of 14% rising in proportion to our increase in revenues.

We have a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts and other receivables. We periodically review our accounts receivable and other receivables to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We are currently reviewing our credit policies and began aggressively pursuing overdue accounts. Salaries and Employee Benefits . For the year ended June 30, 2007 salaries and employee benefits amounted to $359,473 as compared to $326,595 for the year ended June 30, 2006, an increase of 32,878 or 10%, as we increased the number of our employees.

The decrease was attributable to a decrease in office supplies and expenses and other general and administrative expenses. Additionally, due to cost cutting measures, we reduced our office supplies and expenses by $50,873 and reduced other general and administrative expenses by $48,718. Net Income . Net income increased 55.5% from $1,668,699 for the year ended June 30, 2006 to $2,594,526 for the year ended June 30, 2007. This increase in net income was due primarily to revenues and gross profits and the overall decrease in operating expenses as described above. This translates to basic and diluted net income per common share of $0.05 and $0.03 for the years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2007, we had a cash balance of $2,689,358. Total cash of $2,548,041 is located in financial institutions in China under the control of the Jin Ma Companies, with the balance maintained in U.S. accounts which is under our control. Our working capital position increased $3,844,343 to $8,082,851 at December 31, 2007 from $4,238,508 at June 30, 2007. This increase in working capital is primarily attributable to net proceeds of approximately $4,198,000 from the sales of our securities and from net proceeds from convertible debt and recent advances by the Jin Ma Companies to suppliers for construction services of approximately $1,146,000 offset by the acquisition of properties and equipment of $1,854,866. During the six months ended December 31, 2007, the Jin Ma Companies acquired three cement transportation trailers for approximately $1,000,000, several construction cranes for approximately $306,000 and other construction equipment. We have lent $1,800,000 of the net proceeds received from our convertible debt to the Jin Ma Companies, which they are using as working capital for their current operations and to fund their registered capital requirements under PRC wholly-owned foreign enterprise rules. These advances are unsecured and interest free. Upon receipt of additional funds from the second closing of the sale of our 10% secured convertible debentures, we intend to transfer additional funds to the Jin Ma Companies. It is anticipated that this advance will also be unsecured and interest free. There has been no repayment schedule fixed for the funds advanced to date to the Jin Ma Companies and we do not anticipate that a repayment schedule will be established for any additional funds we should advance. Our total current assets increased $1,563,366, or approximately 19%, at December 31, 2007 from June 30, 2007. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in our cash balance of $2,438,314 at December 31, 2007 as compared to June 30, 2007 which is primarily attributable to proceeds from the sale of our securities. Other principal changes in our current assets at December 31, 2007 from June 30, 2007 included an increase in advance to supplier which was offset by decreases in accounts receivable, deferred debt costs and real estate held for sale. At December 31, 2007 our balance sheet reflected an advance from supplier of $1,344,552, an increase of $1,146,439 from June 30, 2007. These amounts represent amounts the Jin Ma Companies advance to vendors from time to time for the purchase of materials. During the three months ended December 31, 2007, it advanced funds to vendors for its real estate segment in the amount of $683,611 and its construction segment in the amount of $355,142 for the purchase of land use right and construction services. 38 At December 31, 2007 the current portion of accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4,648,446 as compared to $5,246,986 at June 30, 2007, a decrease of $598,540 which was attributable to the collection of outstanding balances and was attributable to the Jin Ma Companies construction segment. We anticipate that the balance of these accounts receivable will be paid in accordance with each of their terms. Additionally, at December 31, 2007, we have a net long term accounts receivable of $526,431 consisting of gross receivables of $1,371,953 less an allowance for doubtful accounts of $845,522. Long-term accounts receivables are all related to the Jin Ma Construction segment and represent contract fees uncollected on projects built for government bureaus. For the Jin Ma Construction segment, other receivables consisted of advances to individuals of $39,828 and amounts due from other entities of $681,547 for working capital advances made by it, all of which have been fully reserved at December 31, 2007. For the Jin Ma Real Estate segment, other receivables consisted of advances to individuals of $31,239 and $136,722 due from of Inner Mongolia Electrical Vocational School which represents a cash deposit made by as a guarantee that Jin Ma Real Estate will start the building project on time, and for which it has an allowance for doubtful collections of $31,239. For the hotel segment, Jin Ma Hotel had other receivables from various individuals totaling $102,542 and companies for $14,317, for which it has an allowance for doubtful collection $106,643. Generally, individuals that we advanced funds to were personal friends of Mr. Yang. Currently, the Jin Ma Companies do not provide working capital advances to any company or individual. At December 31, 2007 deferred debt costs were $191,850 as compared to $0 at June 30, 2007 and related to the costs associated with our recent debt financing. These costs will be amortized over the debt term of 16 months. The inventory of real estate held for sale at December 31, 2007 was $534,512 as compared to $1,149,906 at June 30, 2007, a decrease of $615,394. Although the Jin Ma Companies plan on developing new real estate projects, the inventory of real estate held for sale consists of completed developments and this inventory is decreasing. If the Jin Ma Companies sell its remaining inventory of real estate and have no additional units in inventory, the cash flows from the sale of real estate inventory will decrease. Our balance sheet at December 31, 2007 also reflects notes payable to third parties of approximately $1,620,978 which was a working capital loan made to the Jin Ma Companies. These loans bear annual interest rates ranging from 14.4% to 18% and are unsecured. Our balance sheet at December 31, 2007 reflects a due from related parties of $836,817 which represents advances to a related party for working capital. These advances could be deemed to be in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 which prohibits a public company from extending or maintaining credit or arranging for the extension of credit in the form of a personal loan to an officer or director. If it is determined that these working capital advances violated Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, we could become subject to SEC investigations and/or litigation, which may not be resolved favorably and will require significant management time and attention, and we could incur costs, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. We have no operations other than the Contractual Arrangements with the Jin Ma Companies and, accordingly, we are dependent upon the quarterly service fees due us to provide cash to pay our operating expenses. Such payments have not been tendered to us and those funds are being retained by the Jin Ma Companies to fund their operations. At December 31, 2007 the Jin Ma Companies owned us $1,309,455 for such fees. Our CEO is also the CEO and principal shareholder of the Jin Ma Companies. Accordingly, we are solely reliant upon his judgment to ensure that these funds advanced to the Jin Ma Companies are repaid to us. The Jin Ma Companies have represented to us that they intend to either pay all or a portion of the fees due us and/or repay all or a portion of the amounts advanced to them to ensure that we have sufficient capital to make the interest and principal payments on the 10% secured convertible debentures. Should it fail to pay these amounts, we would not have sufficient capital to meet our obligations. Even if the Jin Ma Companies pay all the past due amounts to us, it is possible that the Jin Ma Companies will continue to fail to timely pay our management fees. If the quarterly service fee due us under the Contractual Arrangement are not paid to us on a timely basis, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds to pay our operating expenses in future periods. 39 Other than our existing cash we presently have no other alternative source of working capital. We currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures but believe that our working capital is sufficient to fund our current operations for approximately the next 12 months. In addition, we are required to make quarterly interest payments on the 10% secured convertible debentures and these payments must be made in cash if we do not have registered shares of our common stock available for issuance. To date, we have paid interest due on our convertible debt in cash and through March 1 ,2008, we have made interest payments of $69,299. It is likely that we will be required to make additional interest payments in cash and, as set forth above, we are reliant on the Jin Ma Companies to pay certain of the amounts they owe us in order to provide sufficient funds to make those interest payments The Jin Ma Companies have historically funded their capital expenditures and ongoing development projects from their working capital. Should these funds prove insufficient, the Jin Ma Companies believe that they could secure bank financing at competitive rates as necessary to provide funding for their committed projects. However, the ability of the Jin Ma Companies to raise any significant capital to expand their operations beyond the current level is very limited. We believe that it is in our best long term interests to assist the Jin Ma Companies in their growth plans. As described elsewhere herein, we advanced the Jin Ma Companies $1,800,000 on an unsecured basis from the first closing of the debentures and it is likely we will advance it a substantial portion of the proceeds from the second closing of the debentures. Even with these amounts the Jin Ma Companies may need additional capital to further expand their operations. Accordingly, it is likely that we will seek to raise working capital to fund the further expansion of various construction and real estate projects by the Jin Ma Companies as well as to provide working capital necessary for their current projects, ongoing operations and financial obligations. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in obtaining additional capital, or that such capital will be available in terms acceptable to our company. Even if we are successful in raising additional capital, it is likely that the terms of such capital will be dilutive to our existing shareholders. If we are not able to assist the Jin Ma Companies in their capital needs, it is unlikely that our revenues will grow beyond current levels. Operating Activities Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $259,319 for the six months ended December 31, 2007 as compared to net cash provided $351,336 for the six months ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of $92,017. The decrease of net cash flow provided by operating activities in the 2007 period as compared to the 2006 period was primarily due to an increase in advances to suppliers of $1,108,890, the payment of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $642,811 and a decrease in advances from customers of $459,089 offset by an increase in our net income. For the six months ended December 31, 2007 net cash provided by operating activities was $259,319. The net cash provided by operating activities was attributable primarily to our net income of $1,309,455, a decrease in real estate held for sale of $647,237 together with an add back of non-cash expenses of $683,034 related to deprecation, bad debt expense, interest expense from amortization of debt discount and amortization of debt issuance costs, offset by increases in inventories of $30,785, advances to suppliers of $1,108,890, and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $642,811, income tax payable of $228,512, advances from customers of $459,089 and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings of $124,843. During the six months ended December 31, 2007 the inventory of real estate held for sale decreased by $647,237 as a result of continued sales of complete real estate units. Inventories increased slightly by $30,785 due to normal operating fluctuations related to the timing of orders as did advances to suppliers representing amounts the Jin Ma Companies advance to vendors from time to time for the purchase of materials as described above. During the six month period ended December 31, 2007 we also used cash from operating activities to decrease our accounts payable and accrued expenses and our income tax payable. Finally, during the period our advances from customers decreased due to the timing of customer payments. 40 During the six months ended December 31, 2007 billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings decreased $124,843 and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings decreased $14,289. A substantial portion of Jin Ma Constructions revenues and profits are measured and recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which is discussed further in Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. Jin Ma Constructions use of this method results in recognition of revenues and profits ratably over the life of a contract, based generally on the proportion of costs incurred to date to total costs expected to be incurred for the entire project. The effect of revisions to revenues and estimated costs is recorded when the amounts are known or can be reasonably estimated. Such revisions could occur in any period and their effects could be material. Although Jin Ma Construction has historically made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion of long-term engineering, program and construction management or construction contracts in process, the uncertainties inherent in the estimating process make it possible for actual costs to vary materially from estimates, including reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits. For the fiscal 2007 net cash provided by operating activities was $1,243,306. Cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to our net income of $2,594,526, an increase of $123,643 in advances from customers, an increase of $120,793 in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and a decrease of accounts receivable of $5,786,777 which was offset by increases in other receivables ($213,943), costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings ($14,841), real estate held for sale ($947,019) and deposits ($127,738) and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $8,500,105 together with an add back non-cash items including depreciation and bad debt expense totaling $941,295. During fiscal 2007 billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings increased $120,793 and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings increased $14,841. As discussed above, a substantial portion of Jin Ma Constructions revenues and profits are measured and recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which is discussed further in Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. For fiscal 2006 net cash provided by operating activities was $1.713,486. Cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to our net income of $1,668,699, a decrease of $1,666,989 in real estate held for sale and an increase in of $5,501,971 in accounts payable and accrued expenses which was offset by an increase of $5,064,591 in accounts receivable, an increase of $178,721 in other receivables, an increase of $280,765 in advance to suppliers, and an increase of $529,898 income tax payable as well as a decrease in inventories together with an add back of non-cash items of $725,667. During fiscal 2006 our real estate held for sale decreased as a result of sales of finished units in excess of new units added to inventory. The increase in accounts receivable for fiscal 2006 reflects our increase in revenues and the increase in other receivables is attributable to the advance of funds to third parties for working capital. Investing Activities Net cash flow used in investing activities was $1,953,406 for the six months ended December 31, 2007 as compared to cash used in investing activities of $237,444 for the six months ended December 31, 2006. For the six months ended December 31, 2007, cash used in investing activities consisted of cash used for the purchase of property and equipment of $1,854,866 which included heavy equipment for our construction segment and the payments of a deposit on land use rights of $66,611, increase in construction in progress of $69,562 offset by an increase in due from related parties of $36,128. For the six months ended December 31, 2006, cash used in investing activities consisted of an increase in construction in progress of $129,614 and cash used for the purchase of property and equipment of $107,830. 41 Net cash flow used in investing activities was $1,183,832 for fiscal 2007 as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $43,917 fiscal 2006. For the year ended June 30, 2007, cash used in investing activities consisted of an increase in amounts advanced from related parties of $891,019 and cash used for the purchase of property and equipment of $394,242 offset by a decrease in construction in progress of $101,429.

Financing Activities Net cash flow provided by financing activities was $4,064,390 for the six months ended December 31, 2007 which was primarily attributable to proceeds received from the sale of our common stock of $2,219,252 and net proceeds from convertible debt of $2,183,000 offset by a repayment of loans payable of $133,222 and a payment of placement fees of $204,640. For the six months ended December 31, 2006, we used cash for the repayment of related party advances of $99,536. Net cash flow provided by financing activities was $0 in fiscal 2007 as compared to net cash flow used in financing activities of $2,273,524 in fiscal 2006.

Contractual Obligations We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The following tables summarize our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 Years + Contractual Obligations : Other Indebtedness * $ 1,620,978 $ 136,722 $ 1,162,958 $ 321,298 -- Convertible debt 2,183,000 -- 2,183,000 -- -- Purchase Obligations -- -- -- -- -- Total Contractual Obligations: $ 3,803,978 $ 136,722 $ 3,345,958 $ 321,298 -- * Other indebtedness includes long-time loans borrowed from individuals. 42 Off-balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any or unconsolidated entity. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as stockholders equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing or hedging services with us. Recent Capital Raising Transaction On November 30, 2007 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell an aggregate of $3,275,000 principal amount 10% secured convertible debentures to seven accredited investors and to issue those investors common stock purchase warrants to purchase an aggregate of 9,520,352 shares of our common stock in a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) in reliance on the exemptions provided by Section 4(2) and Rule 506 of Regulation D of that act. Under the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, on the first closing we issued $2,183,000 principal amount 10% secured convertible debentures to the purchasers together with the common stock purchase warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,345,930 shares of our common stock. We paid Next Generation Equity Research, LLC a broker dealer and member of FINRA, a commission of $160,000 and reimbursed one of the investors $30,000 to defer its legal fees in connection with the financing. Upon the receipt of the funds, we advanced $1,800,000 to the Jin Ma Companies on an interest free unsecured basis for use in their operations and to fund their registered capital requirements under PRC wholly-owned foreign enterprise rules. We intend to use the balance of the proceeds for general working capital. Within five days following the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, a second closing will occur and we will issue the remaining $1,092,000 principal amount 10% secured convertible debentures to the purchasers together with the common stock purchase warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,174,422 shares of our common stock. The second closing is conditioned upon the effectiveness of the registration statement. The issuance is not subject to any other condition other than the registration of the securities. We will pay the placement agent a commission at closing, but will not pay any expense reimbursement or other fees on the second closing. Upon receipt of these net proceeds, we intend to advance additional funds to the Jin Ma Companies while retaining sufficient funds to fund our current operations. The debentures, which bear interest at 10% per annum, are due 16 months from the issuance date. Interest is payable in cash quarterly on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 beginning on the first date after the issuance. Through March 31, 2008 we have paid $69,299 in interest on the debentures. At our option, and providing certain conditions precedent have been met, following the date of this prospectus interest can be paid in shares of our common stock valued at the lesser of (i) the conversion rate, or (ii) 90% of the lesser of (a) the average VWAP (as defined in the debenture) for the 20 consecutive trading days prior to the interest payment date or (b) the average VWAP for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the delivery of the interest conversion shares. We have registered 325,191 shares in the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part for possible issuance as interest payments. We are not permitted to prepay the debentures without the prior written consent of the holders. The debentures are convertible at any time at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock based upon a conversion rate of $0.344 per share, subject to adjustment as hereinafter set forth. 43 We agreed that so long as the debentures remain outstanding, unless we receive the prior written consent of the holders of at least 85% of the outstanding principal amount of the debentures, we agreed that we will not:  incur additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions,  incur any liens on any of our property or assets,  repurchase any of our common stock, subject to certain exceptions,  amend our charter documents in a manner that would be adverse to the debenture holders,  pay any cash dividends or distributions on any equity securities, or  enter into any transaction with an affiliate unless it is made on an arms-length basis and approved by a majority of the disinterred directors. If we should default on the debentures, the holders have the right to immediately accelerate the maturity date of the principal amount of the debentures as well as any accrued but unpaid interest and it such amount is not satisfied within five days the interest rate on the debentures increases to 18%. Events of default include customary clauses such as failure to make payments when required, failure to observe any covenant contained in the debentures, a default under any other document executed in connection with the transaction, bankruptcy or default under any other obligation greater than $150,000. In addition, an event of default would occur if our common stock should no longer be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, if we were a party to a change of control transaction involving in excess of 33% of our assets of if the registration statement described below is not declared effective within 180 days after the first closing date, among other provisions. The warrants are exercisable for five years from the date of issuance at an initial exercise price of $0.50 per share, subject to adjustment as hereinafter set forth. The warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis at any time when there is not an effective registration statement covering the underlying shares. We are permitted to call the warrants on 30 trading days prior notice at $0.001 per warrant at any time after the effective date of the registration statement covering the shares underlying the warrants when, (i) the VWAP (as defined in the warrant) for each of 20 consecutive trading days beginning with the effective date of the registration statement exceeds $1.50, (ii) the average daily volume for during this period exceeds 500,000 shares of common stock per trading day and (iii) the holder is not in possession of any information that constitutes, or might constitute, material non-public information which was provided by us to the holder. The initial 6,345,730 warrants were treated as a discount on the 10% secured convertible debentures and were valued at $887,768 to be amortized over the 16-month note term. The fair market value of each warrant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in accordance with SFAS No. 123R using the following weighted-average assumptions: expected dividend yield 0%; risk-free interest rate of 3.41%; volatility of 25% and an expected term of five years. During the six months ended December 31, 2007, amortization of debt issue costs was $12,790. The remaining balance of debt issue costs at December 31, 2007 was $191,850 which will be amortized over the term of the debentures. The amortization of debt discounts for the six months ended December 31, 2007 was $136,437. The balance of the debt discount is $2,046,563 at December 31, 2007 which will be amortized over the term of the debentures. The conversion price of the debentures and the exercise price of the warrants are subject to the proportional adjustment in the event of a stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or similar corporate events. Both the conversion price of the debentures and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the debentures as well as the exercise price of the warrants and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants is subject to adjustment if we should issue shares of common stock or other securities convertible or exercisable into shares of common stock or otherwise reprice any existing conversion or exercise prices to a price less than the then current conversion and/or exercise prices. In that event, the conversion and/or exercise price would be reduced to such lesser price and the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of the debentures and/or exercise of the warrants would be increased so that the aggregate conversion and/or exercise prices prior to such reduction will be equal to the aggregate conversion and/or exercise prices prior to such reduction. The debentures are not convertible and the warrants are not exercisable to the extent that (i) the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the holder and (ii) the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of the debentures and/or the exercise of the warrants would result in the beneficial ownership by holder of more than 4.99% of our then outstanding common stock. This ownership limitation can be increased to 9.99% by the holder upon 61 days notice to us. 44 In conjunction with the transaction Mr. Liankuan Yang, Ms. Runlan Ma and Ms. Yang Yang, officers and directors of Gold Horse International, pledged an aggregate of 19,000,000 shares of our common stock owned by them as additional security for our obligations under the transaction. Mr. Liankuan Yang, Ms. Runlan Ma and Ms. Yang Yang have also entered into lock-up agreements whereby they are agreed not to offer or sell any shares of our common stock owned by them until the 180th trading day after the effective date of the registration statement described elsewhere herein. So long as the debentures are outstanding, should we issue any common stock or common stock equivalent we granted the purchasers a right of first refusal whereby each purchaser in this offering has the right to participate in such subsequent financing up to an amount equal to 100% of such subsequent financing upon the same terms and conditions of that financing. If we undertake such a financing while the debentures remain outstanding, other than an underwritten offering, the holders are entitled to exchange the debentures on a dollar for dollar basis for any securities which we may issue in the subsequent financing. In addition, during the period from the execution of the Securities Purchase Agreement until 90 days following the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part we agreed not to issue any shares of common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into shares of common stock subject to certain exceptions which includes the offer and sale of up to $3,000,000 of equity securities limited solely to offshore purchasers. We also agreed that so long as the purchasers own any of the securities sold or to be issued in the transaction, we will not enter into any agreement which would involve a variable rate transaction, which includes floating conversion prices, conversion prices with reset mechanisms or equity lines of credit among others. We granted the purchasers certain piggy-back registration rights. In addition, we agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering the shares of common stock underlying the $3,275,000 principal amount debentures and the warrants so as to permit the public resale thereof within 45 days from the first closing date. This prospectus is part of that registration statement which registers the resale of certain shares underlying the debentures as well shares which we may issue as interest payments on the debentures or upon exercise of the warrants. We will be required to file one or more additional registration statements to register the shares underlying the debentures and warrants as well as any additional shares we may issue as interest payments on the debentures. We are subject to the payment to the holders liquidated damages if the registration statement is not declared effective within 120 days from the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement (or 150 days if the staff of the SEC reviews the filing), or if all the securities are not registered by April 30, 2008 as well as certain other events. The liquidated damages, which are payable in cash, will be calculated at 1.5% of the aggregate purchase price paid by each holder for every 30 day period, with a maximum of 18% of the aggregate purchase price for a possible penalty of $589,500. If we fail to pay all or any portion of these liquidated damages, they accrue interest at 18% per annum. We are obligated to pay all expenses associated with the registration statement, other than fees and expenses of the holders counsel, if any, any commissions payable by the holders on the sale of the underlying securities. As of December 31, 2007, pursuant to FASB Staff Position, or FSP, EITF 00-19-2, Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements, we have determined that it is unlikely that circumstances allowing for the aforementioned liquidated damages would arise, and therefore we have not recorded any contingent liability in our financial statements. OUR BUSINESS Overview We operate, control and beneficially own the construction, hotel and real estate development businesses in China of the Jin Ma Companies under a series of Contractual Arrangements. Other than the Contractual Arrangements with the Jin Ma Companies, we do not have any business or operations. Pursuant to the Contractual Arrangements we provide business consulting and other general business operation services to the Jin Ma Companies. Through these Contractual Arrangements, we have the ability to control the daily operations and financial affairs of the Jin Ma Companies, appoint each of their senior executives and approve all matters requiring shareholder approval. As a result of these Contractual Arrangements, which enable us to control the Jin Ma Companies, we are considered the primary beneficiary of the Jin Ma Companies. Accordingly, we consolidate the Jin Ma Companies results, assets and liabilities in our financial statements. The creditors of the Jin Ma Companies do not have recourse to any assets we may have. 45 The relationship among the above companies as follows: PRC law currently places certain limitations on foreign ownership of Chinese companies. To comply with these foreign ownership restrictions, we operate our business in China through the Contractual Arrangements with the Jin Ma Companies, each of which is a limited liability company headquartered in Hohhot, the capital city of the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia in China, and organized under PRC laws. Each of the Jin Ma Companies has the relevant licenses and approvals necessary to operate our businesses in China. The Contractual Arrangements are comprised of a series of agreements, including a Consulting Services Agreement and an Operating Agreement, through which we have the right to advise, consult, manage and operate each of the Jin Ma Companies, and collect and own all of their respective net profits. Additionally, under a Shareholders Voting Rights Proxy Agreement, the Jin Ma Companies shareholders have vested their voting control over the Jin Ma Companies to us. In order to further reinforce our rights to control and operate the Jin Ma Companies, these companies and their shareholders have granted us, under an Option Agreement, the exclusive right and option to acquire all of their equity interests in the Jin Ma Companies or, alternatively, all of the assets of the Jin Ma Companies. Further the Jin Ma Companies shareholders have pledged all of their rights, titles and interests in the Jin Ma Companies to us under an Equity Pledge Agreement. Under PRC laws, each of Gold Horse International, Gold Horse Nevada, Global Rise, Jin Ma Real Estate, Jin Ma Construction and Jin Ma Hotel is an independent legal person and none of them is exposed to liabilities incurred by the other party. Other than pursuant to the Contractual Arrangements, the Jin Ma Companies do not transfer any other funds generated from their respective operations to us. We have entered into the following Contractual Arrangements with each of the Jin Ma Companies: Consulting Services Agreements. Pursuant to the exclusive Consulting Services Agreements with each of the Jin Ma Companies, we exclusively provide to the Jin Ma Companies general business operations services and consulting services as well as general business operation advice and strategic planning. Each of the Jin Ma Companies shall pay a quarterly consulting service fees in Renminbi (RMB) to us that is equal to all of its net profit for such quarter. However, as described in Risk Factors appearing earlier in this prospectus, the Jin Ma Companies are presently not remitting these fees to us and are retaining the funds for operating capital. 46 Operating Agreements. Pursuant to the Operating Agreements with the Jin Ma Companies and their respective shareholders, we provide guidance and instructions on the Jin Ma Companies daily operations, financial management and employment issues. The Jin Ma Companies shareholders must designate the candidates recommended by us as their representatives on each of the Jin Ma Companies board of directors. We have the right to appoint senior executives of the Jin Ma Companies.

Inner Mongolia borders, from east to west, the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Gansu, while to the north it borders Mongolia and Russia. The regional capital of Inner Mongolia is Hohhot City. Due to its abundance of natural resources, Inner Mongolia is a national production base in iron, steel and coal, as well as animal husbandry. The Baiyunebo Mine in Baotou, Inner Mongolia is the largest rare earth mine in the world, including gold deposits, iron ore, granite, and graphite, and is also the biggest open-air mine in the world. Inner Mongolia also ranks first in China for wind power storage, averaging 270 million kilowatts per hour. The Hulunbuir Grassland in Inner Mongolia is the largest area of natural grass in the world, and the region is Chinas leading producer of animal feeds. The white goat cashmere of Inner Mongolia is regarded as the best cashmere in the world for its fineness, brightness and whiteness and is commonly referred to as Soft Gold. Inner Mongolia also has the most inland ports - 18 - of all provinces in China. The Manzhouli Railway Port and the Highway Port, which run across Russia to Eastern Europe and Western Europe, are the bridgeheads of the Euro-Asia Land Bridge. By railway, Hohhot City lies on the Jingbao Railway from Beijing to Baotou. Hohhot Baita International Airport is about an hour from city center and only half an hour drive from the Second Ring Road. It serves Hohhot City and surrounding areas, and has direct flights to Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Wuhan, Hong Kong, and Ulan Bator in Mongolia. The Hubao Expressway connects Hohhot City to the more remote areas in Inner Mongolia. Inner Mongolia is also a popular tourism destination, renowned especially for its natural springs. Hohhot City, located in the south-central part of Inner Mongolia, is especially popular during the summer months as a place to escape the heat. An in preparation for 2008 Beijing Olympics, Hohhot City has been upgrading its transportation infrastructure and in June 2007 a new terminal was constructed which is capable of handling 3 million passengers per year. Hohhot City itself has an educated workforce, with 124 scientific research and design institutions and nine universities and colleges all located in the city, which collectively account for 80% of higher education schools in the entire Inner Mongolia. Since 2000, the Chinese central government has been actively encouraging economic developments in Inner Mongolia. Under the auspices of the Western China Development Policy, the Chinese central government has enacted and implemented specific regulations and policies to boost investments in the region, including the Regulations on Encouragement of Foreign Investment of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (I) and the Regulations on Encouragement of Foreign Investment of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (II), both issued in 1996, and the Preferential Policies on Encouragement of Foreign Investment of the Peoples Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, issued in 1999. Additionally, in July 2000, the Hohhot Economic and Technological Development Zone (the HETDZ) was approved as state-level development zone. Located on the western outskirt of Hohhot City proper, the HETDZ now encompasses 9.1 square kilometers, with established companies in such industries as high technology manufacturing, biopharmaceutical, electronic information, chemical manufacturing, textile, and dairy product processing. As a result, Inner Mongolia has witnessed economic growth that has exceeded 10% annually for six consecutive years. Inner Mongolia registered $363.32 million in contractual overseas investment in the first quarter of 2006, up 438% from 2005, according to the Hohhot City branch of the Peoples Bank of China. The nominal GDP of Inner Mongolia in 2005 was 389.5 billion RMB (approximately US$47.2 billion), a growth of 21.6% from 2004 and 153% from 2000, with an average annual increase of 17.1% according to the Inner Mongolia Government website (www.nmg.gov.cn). Its per capita GDP exceeded 15,500 RMB (approximately US$1,900). The urban per capita disposable income and rural per capita net income for 2005 were 9,130 RMB and 2,980 RMB, up 78% and 46% respectively from 2004. 49 OVERVIEW OF THE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS Chinas Real Estate Market Chinas growing real estate market is primarily the confluence of two factors: the passage of laws protecting property ownership rights by the Chinese central government to encourage homeownership, and rapid urbanization caused by steady internal migrations from rural regions to cities. Prior to the 1990s, all land and housing was owned by the state. Then in 1998, the Chinese central government created the basic building block of a market economy in real estate - a transferable ownership interest. This interest, known as a land use right, is not 100% ownership interest as we know it in the West. Rather, the state grants a right for a fixed period - varying from 40 years to 70 years - to use a land for the purpose specified in the land use rights granting charter. Land use rights are transferable, mortgageable, leaseable and renewable, and can usually be subdivided. And although the long term implications of land use right are still uncertain as the concept is still relatively new, any such uncertainties have not discouraged real estate investments and developments. In 2006, 1.938 trillion RMB (approximately US$248.4 billion) were invested in real estate projects, up 21.8% from 2005, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS). About 41.8%of the investment was used in developing and constructing ordinary residential housing projects, 3.6% for low-cost housing projects and 7.3% for up-market apartment and villas, the CASS report said. The central government expects an increase in aggregate housing area to 64.5 billion square feet, or approximately 70 million individual housing units, by 2015. Hohhot City, as the capital of the Inner Mongolia region, is experiencing a rapid pace of real estate development. During the first 10 months of 2005, 2.14 billion RMB were invested in commercial buildings, an increase of 20.5% from 2004, and 2.03 billion RMB, an increase of 81.8%, were invested in residential developments. Accordingly to the Peoples Bank of China Hohhot Central Sub-branch, overseas investors looking at Hohhot have shifted their focus from traditional industries such as milk, meat, cashmere and manufacturing, to real estate. In 2005, 59.23% of the regions overseas investment in the period went to the real estate sector. Fueling the nonstop development and construction activities is the steady internal migration toward urban centers throughout China. The nations urban population rose from roughly 170 million in 1978 to 540 million in 2004. The countrys economic boom has drawn rural Chinese to cities in search of better-paying opportunities than those in the countryside, fueling urbanization as well as an increase in migration. Accordingly to the United Nations, more than 40% of the Chinese population lived in cities in 2005, compared with 15% in 1950s, and Chinas urban population is expected to grow about 60% to 875 million by 2030. Close to half of the approximately 23.9 million people in Inner Mongolia now live in cities, accordingly to the Chinese central government. Hohhot City has a population of 2.4 million and growing, and demand for housing there is reflected in the increase of 14.9% to the prices of new apartments in 2006. At the same time, the rising activity in the local and regional real estate market that has benefited the Jin Ma Companies construction and real estate development operations has also, on a national level, caused grave concerns to the Chinese central government, which fears that soaring housing prices could help overheat the countrys already fast-growing economy, and possibly lead to social unrest. To rein in the real estate market, the Chinese central government has taken measures to discourage borrowing, such as raising interest rates and increasing the amount of money that banks must hold in reserve thereby serving to reduce the amount available for lending. Chinas Hotel Industry The hotel industry is a growing segment within the hospitality industry, which is itself a major component of the travel industry. Companies in the lodging industry generally operate in one or more of the various lodging segments, including luxury, upscale, middle and economy. Growth in demand in the lodging industry is driven by two main factors; the general health of the travel and tourism industry and the propensity for corporate spending on business travel. 50 China is now ranked fourth in the world in terms of overseas tourist arrivals, and the World Travel Organization predicts China will become the number one global tourism destination by 2020. China received 103.6 million overseas visits in the first 10 months of 2006, up 3.4% from the same period in 2005, and 60 times more than in 1978, according to the Chinese National Tourism Administration. Business tourists currently account for 25% of all inbound arrivals; and this sector is anticipated to grow to support the expanding economy. The country is now competing head on with other global tourism destinations. The growing popularity of Inner Mongolia as a tourism destination, and the importance of Hohhot City as the gateway to the region, is demonstrated by the number of foreign hotel operators that are expanding their operations in the city. Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts, a premium Asian-Pacific hotel brand, opened a hotel in Hohhot City in late 2007. Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide is teaming up with Inner Mongolian Datang International Tuo Ke Tuo Power Generation Company to manage the Sheraton Hohhot Hotel in downtown Hohhot City, which is scheduled to open in July 2009. To further elevate the level of Chinas tourist service, as well as promote the protection, development, management and construction of tourist spots and destinations, the central government has actively promoted the use of rating systems throughout the hotel industry. China had 12,930 star-ranked tourist hotels nationwide by the end of 2006, or 5,572 more than in 2001, which included 288 five-star hotels, 1,307 four-star hotels, 4,747 three-star hotels, and more than 6,500 one-and two-star hotels in China. Despite the recent series of unprecedented health crises in China, such as the outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza (bird flu), the lodging industry is growing. Even as the aggregate number of hotel rooms has steadily increased in China, demand in the past few years has consistently outpaced supply, creating a continuing favorable business environment for our hotel operation. THE JIN MA COMPANIES BUSINESS OPERATIONS Through the three Jin Ma Companies, we operate in three reportable segments:  construction,  hotel management, and  real estate development.

Its employees monitor the construction of each project, participate in all material design and building decisions, coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, subject their work to quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with applicable zoning and building codes. The selection of the subcontractors is conducted through a competitive process, and several subcontractors are invited to participate. The main criteria for selecting subcontractors are cost, qualifications, the quality of completed projects and of work done, if any, on existing or prior projects. Once the selection process is completed, Jin Ma Construction will normally negotiate a fixed price contract with the sub-contractors which include terms relating to time for completion of construction, quality of materials used and warranty periods. 55 Project Management . Jin Ma Constructions project management is undertaken by a team of architects, engineers, project managers and other support staff. The project management team is responsible for the overall management of all of the development projects. For each project, there is a team responsible for the day-to-day management. Project management covers all major stages of a development project, as follows:  Feasibility Studies . Conducting a detailed geological study and market study, formulating a master timetable, and preparing preliminary proposals for the type and class of property to be constructed;  Design . Completing a preliminary design layout and obtaining approvals from relevant authorities, commencing site preparation, selecting construction materials, modifying the design layout, producing a construction blue-print and establishing a construction management team;  Construction . Obtaining, evaluating and selecting sub-contractor bids, finalizing the design layout and construction blue-print, monitoring construction progress compared to our timetable and introducing and implementing quality and cost control procedures; and  Completion . Establishing a property management team, submitting a completion and inspection report to the governmental authorities, obtaining required government approvals and settling payments. Quality Control . Jin Ma Construction places emphasis on the quality of its development projects and implement quality control procedures at different construction stages to ensure that the work done by its sub-contractors meets its standards and requirements and those of the relevant governmental authorities. Jin Ma Construction imposes quality control on its building materials. Its on-site management team conducts regular quality inspections of the construction work. When a particular section of construction work is completed, its on-site management team will inspect the work to ensure that the work is in compliance with its quality standards and the relevant governmental regulations. Jin Ma Construction requires its sub-contractors to promptly remedy all defects, and it then makes a further inspection of their work. Competitive Strengths Jin Ma Construction is in competition with other construction companies in Hohhot City and Inner Mongolia, some of which are larger and have greater financial resources than it. These include Inner Mongolia Third Construction Company and Hohhot City Construction Company. Nevertheless, Jin Ma Construction believes that it can effectively compete with these companies. Jin Ma Construction is one of the first construction companies in the region, and it has gained a solid reputation based on the quality of its work and an established track record spanning a diverse array of projects. Through the numerous government projects that it has constructed, Jin Ma Construction has established an excellent working relationship with the local and regional governments, and it continues to act as general contractor in many ongoing government projects. All of its engineering and technical staff is certified in their respective fields, and many, such as its construction manager and its technical director, have been in the industry and with Jin Ma Construction for over 20 years. Since 2004, Jin Ma Construction has been independently audited and certified as being in conformance with the ISO 9001:2000 standards for quality management system, the ISO 140001:1996 standards for environmental management system, and the GB/T28001:200 standards for occupational safety management system. These certifications, while not mandated by law, provide Jin Ma Construction with a competitive edge over many of its competitors that are not similarly certified, in that they lend further assurance to its customers in the quality of its work. 56 The Hotel Management Business Jin Ma Hotel derives revenue primarily from guest room rentals and food and beverage operations at the Inner Mongolia Jin Ma Hotel. The 22-room hotel is a full-service two-star facility, offering amenities such as restaurant, business center, and a lounge. Its guests can also partake in traditional Chinese ceremonies that are offered regularly in its restaurant and banquet facilities. The hotel is located on an approximately 2.16 acre lot, owned by Jin Ma Hotel, and housed in a single building with approximately 5,048 square meters that has been configured for use as the hotel as well as offices on the upper floor of the building for the Jin Ma Companies. The property includes a parking garage for 36 cars. Jin Ma Hotel also owns all of the fixtures, improvements, furniture, and the other contents currently used in the business of the hotel. Recent Renovation Program In fiscal 2006, Jin Ma Hotel completed the most significant capital investment program in its history in order to improve comfort, freshen décor and upgrade technology at the hotel. It invested over USD$180,000 into the renovation of the hotel, primarily for all guest rooms as well as non-room guest contact areas such as lobbies, restaurants, exteriors, banquet rooms and landscaping. The capital improvements were funded primarily from existing cash. Jin Ma Hotel continued to operate the hotel during the renovation process, which limited its ability to maximize occupancy and room rates at these properties during primarily the last two quarters of fiscal 2006. As a result, operating performance at the hotel was negatively impacted. However, as evidenced by its overall occupancy rate of 96% during fiscal 2006, Jin Ma Hotel believes the results of this program have been successful and that its capital investment will continue to improve its operating results. Competitive Strengths Locally, Jin Ma Hotels competition includes the Inner Mongolia Hotel and the Inner Mongolia Zhao Jun Hotel. However, many well-known hotel operators are also seeking to establish their presence in the area, including the Shangri-La Hotel and Resort in late 2007 and the Sheraton Hohhot Hotel in July 2009. Because many of these hotels are aimed toward the luxury segment of the industry, Jin Ma Hotel believes that it have a competitive advantage in attracting those travelers to the city who are more price-sensitive. With its renovation efforts, it can offer many of the same amenities available at its higher-price competitors, but without increasing the costs to its guests. Real Estate Development Jin Ma Real Estate designs, develops, markets and sells high-quality, affordable homes in apartment high-rises, which are targeted at Chinese middle income families. It also designs, develops, markets and sells these homes in mixed-use development projects. Its development projects are all in Hohhot City. Its apartments are targeted for different segments within the mass residential property market, including young, white-collar employees, middle to senior managers in enterprises, entrepreneurs and families with young children. These upwardly mobile people represent the emerging middle class and are a growing source of demand in the mass residential property market. Certain properties developed by Jin Ma Real Estate are mixed-use properties that also include retail and commercial floors on the lower levels of the buildings. 57 Jin Ma Real Estate presently is in the process of obtaining land use rights certificates in respect of each of these property development projects. Know as Gold Horse Gardens, Jin Ma Real Estate initiated plans and designs for the development of this project in Hohhot City with aggregate site area of approximately 500 acres, and expects to obtain land use rights certificates to the project site prior to the projected commencement date of April 2008. Jin Ma Real Estate intends to continue to solidify its position in Hohhot City, and will also consider quality business opportunities in other fast growing areas of Inner Mongolia, if market conditions are appropriate.

Jin Ma Real Estate has not yet applied for land use rights certificate in connection with this project but it expects to file for and receive approval by commencement date . Jin Ma Real Estates Business Strategy It is focusing on Hohhot City for the development of residential communities . Jin Ma Real Estate believes that the size and growth potential of Hohhot City coupled with the ongoing liberalization of the real estate markets offer it considerable growth opportunities. It intends to develop additional residential communities and mixed-use developments in Hohhot City proper and surrounding areas that are within reasonable commuting distance to Hohhot City. Jin Ma Real Estate believes that the following features of Hohhot City represent continuing growth opportunities for it in the city:  a population of more than 2.4 million with established economic development and infrastructure;  a significant level of unsatisfied demand for high quality, yet affordable homes;  a regulatory environment that encourages the development of our residential communities, in terms of enabling us to obtain necessary permits and approvals to engage in our business without undue difficulty or expense, and encourages individual home ownership through the use of subsidies or otherwise; and  available real estate development rights at attractive prices. Jin Ma Real Estate targets the emerging Chinese middle-income class as home buyers. Its target residential market is the growing Chinese middle income population. Chinas home builders have traditionally targeted the upper and lower income market, and largely ignored the middle-income class. Because of banking reforms permitting wider availability of home mortgage loans and the positive effects of Chinas economic reforms, Jin Ma Real Estate believes that the home building market for the middle-income class represents substantial growth opportunities for it. Jin Ma Real Estate provides substantial benefits to home buyers . Jin Ma Real Estate believes that its residential apartments provide the following benefits to home buyers:  affordable living space to support large families, frequently include three generations - grandparents, parents and children;  living within close proximity to schools, shopping centers, retail shops, offices, medical facilities, city centers and public transportation; and  quality building management services including security, landscape and maintenance. Jin Ma Real Estate aims to continue its commitment to quality. It seeks to construct buildings having a high quality of construction and workmanship. Jin Ma Real Estates strive to enter markets early . It will continue to enter markets early where it can acquire land use rights at reasonable prices and develop residential communities in potential growth centers in and around Hohhot City. Jin Ma Real Estate has successfully implemented this strategy, where it is one of the first home builders to develop a residential community targeted at middle income families. Jin Ma Real Estate believes that early entry into markets will continue to enable it to establish ourselves in these markets before the onset of widespread competition. 59 Jin Ma Real Estate selects superior sites and carefully evaluate the feasibility of each project. It believes that securing a good location is a major factor in the success of a property development project. It considers the following factors when it evaluates it property development sites:  size of land;  geographic location;  potential financial return;  potential market demand for the development;  its existing property portfolio and available resources;  land cost, affordability and potential financial return;  overall market situation and opportunities;  access to city centers;  geological conditions;  demolition and resettlement costs; and  infrastructure support. During the site selection process, it will evaluate and research the economic and social situation of the area, the market demand for and potential returns from a proposed project and the funding and manpower requirements. Once Jin Ma Real Estate has selected a site, it formulates a comprehensive development plan. Jin Ma Real Estates Customers Its target market for residential customers is Chinese middle income families in key urban markets who want to become home owners in a planned community. It classifies a typical family income of RMB 36,000, or approximately $ 4,600, per year as middle income earners. It believes that families earning this income will be able to purchase its houses costing approximately RMB 200,000, or approximately $26,000, through a down payment of 30% or approximately RMB 60,000, or approximately $7,700, with the balance financed by a bank mortgage having a repayment period ranging from five to 10 years, resulting in a monthly payment of between RMB 1,500 to RMB 2,000, or approximately $190 to $260. For each development project, Jin Ma Real Estate designates specific employees as a team to handle the related sales and marketing activities. Subject to market conditions and government approval by the relevant land administration bureau, it seeks to pre-sell its development projects at an early stage. It will also arrange with one or more banks to provide mortgage loan facilities to home purchasers for up to 70% of the home purchase price, substantially all of which is guaranteed by Jin Ma Real Estate until the homes are delivered to the buyers. Its sales and marketing strategy involves the following key elements:  offering a financing package for home buyers which pre-qualifies home buyers for a 70% mortgage with only a small down payment, or booking fee, which is typically no more than RMB 60,000, or approximately $7,874, and the balance of the purchase price paid over a staggered period between one to two months;  advertising through various media, including regional newspapers, magazines, posters, billboards and advertising pamphlets to reach potential purchasers;  using sales literature and brochures which describe its projects and its company; and  operating a sales center in a high-traffic downtown area where its office is located and on-site. Jin Ma Real Estate has established a high level of visibility in Hohhot City. Its also believes that local awareness of its project has been facilitated through word of mouth. Sales of its homes are normally made at its sales centers situated either in the city center or at its development site. 60 Pre-Sale of Jin Ma Real Estate Apartment Units Jin Ma Real Estate seeks to pre-sell homes in the several phases in its development as early as possible, subject to market conditions and regulatory constraints. Pre-sales occur when units of a project are sold while the project is still under construction. Under Chinese law, pre-sale is only permitted if a pre-sale permit has been granted by the relevant land administration bureau to the project which is still under construction. Pre-selling allows Jin Ma Real Estate to begin marketing its development before it would otherwise be able to do so, and shortens the time during which it has market exposure for the construction and other expenses of its developments. Pre-sales also allow Jin Ma Real Estate to improve its working capital management by accelerating its cash inflow and to minimize market risks associated with its development projects. In a pre-sale, the first step is that the home buyer pays an initial booking fee. The home buyer then pays 30% of the purchase price less the booking fee upon the execution of a sales and purchase agreement. The remaining 70% must be paid over a staggered period between one to two months although, in most instances, it is paid by the bank providing the mortgage financing upon execution of the sales and purchase agreement. During fiscal 2007, only a small percentage of Jin Ma Real Estates units were presold. It plans on using its best efforts to increase the amount of presold units in the future. Financing for Jin Ma Real Estate Home Purchasers As part of its pre-sale activities, Jin Ma Real Estate may arrange for commercial banks to provide purchaser financing in the sale of our developments. Unlike mortgage financing in the United States, banks will typically look to the developer and the planned development to determine whether to make a commitment to provide purchaser mortgages. However, the banks retain the right to approve or reject mortgages on an individual basis based upon the perceived credit-worthiness of the home purchaser and other factors that it considers appropriate. Jin Ma Real Estate guarantees a customers mortgage until the home is handed over to the customer. Jin Ma Real Estates customers typically arrange for mortgages through China Construction Bank, The Peoples Bank of China, or Agricultural Bank of China. Project Finance Jin Ma Real Estate has financed the development of its development projects to date through bank borrowings, proceeds from the pre-sale of portions of its development projects, credits provided by its contractors and through its internally generated funds. Because each development project will require a substantial amount of capital to finance its construction cost, it is Jin Ma Real Estates policy to control the timing of the launch of each of its development projects and the phases of these projects. Competitive Strengths The development and sale of residential and commercial real estate markets in China are subject to intense competition. Jin Ma Real Estate competes with numerous small and large developers for sales on the basis of a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities, design, quality and price. It also competes for sales with individual resales of existing homes and condominiums and available rental housing. Jin Ma Real Estate believes that it compares favorably to other developers in the Hohhot City area in which it operates, due primarily to its experience within this geographic market, and its responsiveness to market conditions enables it to capitalize on the opportunities for advantageous land acquisitions in desirable locations. Its competitors include the Inner Mongolia Ju Hua Real Estate Development Co., Ltd., Inner Mongolia Chi Cheng Real Estate Development Co., Ltd., Hohhot Jia Di Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. and Inner Mongolia Nai Lun Real Estate Development Co., Ltd., many of whom have greater financial, managerial, marketing and other resources than Jin Ma Real Estate. Residential and commercial property developers compete not only for property buyers, but also for desirable properties, raw materials and skilled subcontractors. Jin Ma Real Estate also expects that continued economic development of China in general and in Hohhot City in particular will be accompanied by further property development and expansion. It believes that its principal competitive strengths are as follows: 61  Jin Ma Real Estates management has extensive experience and in-depth knowledge of the Hohhot City and Inner Mongolia real estate markets;  its strategy which emphasizes development high-quality residential properties for middle income families;  its access to construction capabilities through Jin Ma Construction;  its focus on Hohhot City and surrounding areas, in which Jin Ma Real Estate enjoys competitive advantages;  its experienced project management team, which effectively and actively controls every stage of the development of its projects; and  its close working relationships with both the local and regional governments. SUPPLIERS Construction Jin Ma Construction does not maintain significant inventories of construction materials except for work in process and a limited amount of other construction materials. Generally, the construction materials used in its operations are readily available from numerous sources. Jin Ma Construction owns, maintains and operates approximately 80 vehicles and construction related equipment that can, and are often deployed, on projects that it is serving as general contractor. Jin Ma Construction uses five to seven subcontractors to perform substantially all of its construction services and to develop its real estate projects. Management is aware of similar subcontractors that are available to perform construction services if required and management has plans to engage their services if necessary. Hotel Management Jin Ma Hotel acquires the supplies for the hotel operation from various local sources. It has no long term agreements with its suppliers, and purchase supplies on a purchase order basis. Management recognizes that this strategy also carries with it the potential disadvantages and risks of shortages and supply interruptions. Jin Ma Hotels suppliers generally are meeting its supply requirements, and it believes its relationships with its suppliers are stable. Real Estate Development The supply of land is controlled by the government. All such purchases of land are required to be reported to and authorized by the regional government of Inner Mongolia and/or the municipal government of Hohhot City. Jin Ma Real Estate uses subcontractors for the development of its projects and selects the lowest-cost provider through an open bidding process. Such service providers are numerous in Hohhot City and it foresees no difficulties in securing alternative sources of services as needed. Government Approval and Regulation of the Jin Ma Companies Principal Products or Services The Jin Ma Companies believe that each of the its companies has been compliant to date with all registrations and requirements for the issuance and maintenance of all licenses required by the applicable governing authorities in China and that such laws, rules and regulations do not currently have a material impact on its operations: 62 Construction. Chinas construction industry is heavily regulated by the national government. On November 1, 1997, the Central Government of the PRC published the Construction Law of the PRC, Presidential Order No. 91 , which is the basic construction law of China. This law outlines the basic requirements and rules for all construction activity in China. Underneath the National Government, the Ministry of Construction also writes laws. On March 14, 2001, the Ministry of Construction published Rule No. 87 , which puts forth licensing requirements for all construction companies operating in China. The Ministry of Construction also writes specific standards for all different types of construction. These standards stipulate the basic requirements for construction companies in China in such areas as registered capital, tangible assets, liability insurance, employee regulations and engineering certifications. The standards also have graded levels of qualification. Jin Ma Construction has second class certification of its constructions operation. In addition, provincial and municipal governments may also enact regulations through their own construction bureaus. Hotel Management. The hotel industry in China is subject to a number of laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating specifically to hotel operation and management, as well as those relating to environmental and consumer protection. There are no regulatory ceilings on room rates in China. The market-based pricing is permissible for the hotel industry and room rates may be determined at the sole discretion of hotel management. Relative to other industries in China, regulation of the hotel industry in China is still developing and evolving. As a result, most legislative action has consisted of general measures such as industry standards, rules or circulars issued by different ministries rather than detailed legislation. Many of these standards, rules and circulars date from the late 1990s, and it is expected that they may be amended, revised or expanded in the coming years as the hotel industry in China matures. Real Estate Development. Jin Ma Real Estates real estate development projects are subject to various laws and governmental regulations, such as zoning regulations, relating to its business operations and project developments. Real estate developers may secure land from the city government by obtaining exploitation and utilization rights over land through public tendering. The maximum term for such leasehold interest ranges from 40 to 70 years depending on the purpose of use. Leasehold interests obtained legally may be transferred, leased, and mortgaged during the leasehold period. Jin Ma Real Estate must obtain and keep current various licenses, permits and regulatory approvals for its development projects. Due to the increasing levels of development in the areas of China where Jin Ma Real Estate currently operates, it is possible that new laws, rules and/or regulations may be adopted that could affect both its current and proposed development projects. The enactment of such laws, rules or regulations in the future could have a negative impact on its projected growth or profitability, which could decrease its projected revenues or increase its costs of doing business. Employees As of March 31, 2008, the Jin Ma Companies collectively had a total of 480 full time employees. Jin Ma Construction accounted for 253 employees, including 26 management personnel; Jin Ma Hotel accounted for 180 employees, including 32 management personnel; Jin Ma Real Estate accounted for 37 employees, all of which are management and sales personnel; and Inner Mongolia (Cayman) Technology & Development Ltd has five administrative employees. Management believes that our relations with our employees are good. We are required, as are the Jin Ma Companies, to contribute a portion of our employees total salaries to the Chinese governments social insurance funds, including medical insurance, unemployment insurance and job injuries insurance, in accordance with relevant regulations. In the last two fiscal years, the Jin Ma Companies contributed, in the aggregate, approximately $18,000 and $14,000 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We expect the amount of contribution to the governments social insurance funds to increase in the future as we expand our workforce and operations. 63 OUR HISTORY Gold Horse International was originally incorporated on March 31, 2000 in the State of New Jersey under its former name Segway III Corp. On June 29, 2007, we executed a Share Exchange Agreement to acquire Gold Horse Nevada. Under the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, at the closing we issued 48,500,000 shares of our common stock to the Gold Horse Nevada stockholders and their assignees which included Genesis and its assignees in exchange for 100% of the common stock of Gold Horse Nevada. Additionally, Mr. Andrew Norins, our then President, CEO and sole director, cancelled 9,655,050 shares of our common stock he owned immediately prior to the closing. After giving effect to the cancellation of Mr. Norins shares, we had a total of 1,500,002 shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to closing. After the closing, we had a total of 50,000,002 shares of common stock outstanding, with the Gold Horse Nevada stockholders and their assignees owning 97% of the total of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The balance was held by our shareholder who held shares prior to the closing. In addition, immediately prior to the closing, Mr. Norins paid our creditors the amounts satisfying all of our obligations that were outstanding immediately prior to the closing. Following the closing, Gold Horse Nevada became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Global Rise is a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands on May 9, 2007, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gold Horse Nevada. Gold Horse Nevada entered into the Contractual Arrangements with each of the Jin Ma Companies and their respective shareholders on August 31, 2006. On June 29, 2007, concurrently with the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement described above, the Contractual Arrangements were amended and restated by and among Gold Horse Nevada, Global Rise and Gold Horse International on the one hand, and each of the Jin Ma Companies and the Jin Ma Companies shareholders on the other hand, under which, among other things, Global Rise was made a party to the Contractual Arrangements. On October 29, 2007 we filed a Certificate of Domestication and Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Florida which result in the domestication of the company in Florida under the name Gold Horse International, Inc. PROPERTY The Jin Ma Companies properties are located in Hohhot City, the capital city of the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia in China. To house its staff, and as its corporate headquarters, it maintains an office within the Jin Ma Hotel. The Jin Ma Companies believes that this arrangement is adequate for its current and immediately foreseeable operating needs.

No member of our Board of Directors received compensation for their services for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Financial Code of Ethics On February 1, 2006 our Board of Directors adopted a Financial Code of Ethics which applies to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and members of our financial department. We will provide a copy, without charge, to any person desiring a copy of the Financial Code of Ethics, by written request to, No. 31 Tongdao Road South, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China, Attention: Corporate Secretary. In addition, we have filed a copy of the Financial Code of Ethics with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. Please see Where You Can Find Additional Information appearing later is this prospectus. Committees of the Board of Directors Our Board of Directors has not established any committees, including an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee or a Nominating Committee, any committee performing a similar function. The functions of those committees are being undertaken by the entire board as a whole. Our board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because it believes the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by our Board of Directors as a whole. Further, we are currently quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, which does not have any qualitative requirements mandating the establishment of any particular committees. We do not have a policy regarding the consideration of any director candidates which may be recommended by our shareholders, including the minimum qualifications for director candidates, nor has our Board of Directors established a process for identifying and evaluating director nominees. We have not adopted a policy regarding the handling of any potential recommendation of director candidates by our shareholders, including the procedures to be followed. Our Board has not considered or adopted any of these policies as we have never received a recommendation from any shareholder for any candidate to serve on our Board of Directors. Given the nature of our operations and lack of directors and officers insurance coverage, we do not anticipate that any of our shareholders will make such a recommendation in the near future. While there have been no nominations of additional directors proposed, in the event such a proposal is made, all members of our Board will participate in the consideration of director nominees. 66 None of our directors is an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of Item 401(e) of Regulation S-B. In general, an audit committee financial expert is an individual member of the audit committee or Board of Directors who:  understands generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements,  is able to assess the general application of such principles in connection with accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves,  has experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements comparable to the breadth and complexity to our financial statements,  understands internal controls over financial reporting, and  understands audit committee functions. We believe that the members of our Board of Directors are collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances. Executive Compensation Summary Compensation Table The following table summarizes all compensation recorded by us in each of the last two completed fiscal years for our principal executive officer, each other executive officer serving as such whose annual compensation exceeded $100,000 and up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would have been made in this table but for the fact that the individual was not serving as an executive officer of our company at June 30, 2007.

His compensation is determined from time to time by the Boards of Directors of the Jin Ma Companies, of which he is a member. In determining the amount of compensation to be paid, such Board of Directors arbitrarily settles upon an amount representing a salary and a benefit package. The amount of compensation is not tied to any performance goals or other traditional measurements and may be increased from time to time at the sole discretion of such Boards.

The purpose of the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan is to offer to our employees, officers, directors and consultants whose past, present and/or potential contributions to our company have been or are or will be important to our success, an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in our company. The issuance of grants under the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan will be made to persons who are closely related to us and who provide bona fide services to us in connection with our business. Under Federal securities laws, these services cannot be in connection with the offer of sale of our securities in a capital raising transaction nor directly or indirectly promote or maintain a market for our securities. We have currently reserved 3,000,000 of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock for issuance under the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan. 68 Plan options may either be options qualifying as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or non-qualified options. In addition, the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan allows for the inclusion of a reload option provision, which permits an eligible person to pay the exercise price of the option with shares of common stock owned by the eligible person and receive a new option to purchase shares of common stock equal in number to the tendered shares. Any incentive option granted under the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan must provide for an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant, but the exercise price of any incentive option granted to an eligible employee owning more than 10% of our outstanding common stock must not be less than 110% of fair market value on the date of the grant. Any non-qualified option granted under the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan must provide for an exercise price of not less than the par value of our common stock. The term of each plan option and the manner in which it may be exercised is determined by the Board of Directors or the compensation committee, provided that no option may be exercisable more than 10 years after the date of its grant and, in the case of an incentive option granted to an eligible employee owning more than 10% of the common stock, no more than five years after the date of the grant. Unless the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan is approved by our shareholders by October 25, 2008, no incentive stock options may be granted and all incentive stock options that may have been previously granted shall automatically be converted into non-qualified stock options. Subject to the limitation on the aggregate number of shares issuable under the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan, there is no maximum or minimum number of shares as to which a stock grant or plan option may be granted to any person. Shares used for stock grants and plan options may be authorized and unissued shares or shares reacquired by us, including shares purchased in the open market. Shares covered by plan options which terminate unexercised will again become available for grant as additional options, without decreasing the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan, although such shares may also be used by us for other purposes. As of December 31, 2007 we have not made any grants under the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan. Limitation on Liability Under our articles of incorporation, our directors are not liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty, except in connection with:  breach of the directors duty of loyalty to us or our shareholders;  acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law;  a transaction from which our director received an improper benefit; or  an act or omission for which the liability of a director is expressly provided under Florida law. In addition, our bylaws provides that we must indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by Florida law for all expenses incurred in the settlement of any actions against such persons in connection with their having served as officers or directors. Insofar as the limitation of, or indemnification for, liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing, or otherwise, we have been advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such limitation or indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS PRC law currently limits foreign equity ownership of Chinese companies. To comply with these foreign ownership restrictions, we operate our business in China through the Contractual Arrangements with each of the Jin Ma Companies and their respective shareholders that were executed on August 31, 2006. Certain of our principal shareholders, executive officers and directors are also principal owners, officers and directors of various of the Jin Ma Companies, including Mr. Yang, Ms. Ma, Messrs. and Wenbio Wang and Ms. Yang. 69 From time to time, the Jin Ma Companies advance funds to companies related through common ownership for working capital purposes. These advances are non interest bearing, unsecured and payable on demand. At December 31, 2007, the Jin Ma Companies had a net receivable from these related entities of $836,817. Director Independence Our Board of Directors has determined that it does not have a member that is independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS At March 31, 2008 we had 52,544,603 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.

Securities Authorized For Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans We have not adopted any equity compensation or similar plans. 71 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES Our authorized capital stock consists of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. As of March 31, 2008, there were 52,544,603 shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. Common stock Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters submitted to a shareholder vote. Holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. Holders of common stock are entitled to share in all dividends that the Board of Directors, in its discretion, declares from legally available funds. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, subject to the preferences of any shares of preferred stock which may then be authorized and outstanding, each outstanding share entitles its holder to participate in all assets that remain after payment of liabilities and after providing for each class of stock, if any, having preference over the common stock. Holders of common stock have no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights, and there are no redemption provisions for the common stock. The rights of the holders of common stock are subject to any rights that may be fixed for holders of preferred stock, when and if any preferred stock is authorized and issued. All outstanding shares of common stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Preferred stock We are authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series with such designations, voting powers, if any, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and such qualifications, limitations and restrictions, as are determined by resolution of our Board of Directors. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by shareholders and could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock. In certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could depress the market price of the common stock. 10% secured convertible debentures On November 30, 2007 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell an aggregate of $3,275,000 principal amount 10% secured convertible debentures as described earlier in this prospectus under Managements Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation - Recent Capital Raising Transaction. The terms of these debentures are described in that section. Common stock purchase warrants In connection with the sale of the $3,275,000 principal amount 10% secured convertible debentures we issued five year common stock purchase warrants to purchase an aggregate of 9,520,352 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of at $0.50 per share. The terms of those warrants are described earlier in this prospectus under Managements Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation - Recent Capital Raising Transaction. Transfer agent Our transfer agent is Island Stock Transfer, 100 Second Avenue South, Suite 104N, St. Petersburg, Florida , and its telephone number is (727) 289-0100. 72 SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS At March 31, 2008 we had 52,5444,603 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.

Because the selling security holders may sell some or all of the securities owned by them, and because there are currently no agreements, arrangements or understandings with respect to the sale of any of the securities, no estimate can be given as to the number of securities that will be held by the selling security holders upon termination of any offering made hereby. If all the securities offered hereby are sold, the selling security holders will not own any securities after the offering.

We have agreed to pay full costs and expenses, incentives to the issuance, offer, sale and delivery of the shares, including all fees and expenses in preparing, filing and printing the registration statement and prospectus and related exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto and mailing of those items. We will not pay selling commissions and expenses associated with any sale by the selling security holders. 75 PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION Each selling security holder and any of their pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares of common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board or any other stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. A selling security holder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares:  ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;  an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;  privately negotiated transactions;  settlement of short sales entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part;  broker-dealers may agree with the selling security holders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share;  through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;  a combination of any such methods of sale; or  any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. The selling security holders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as amended, if available, rather than under this prospectus. Broker-dealers engaged by the selling security holders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling security holders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) NASD Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with NASD IM-2440. In connection with the sale of the common stock or interests therein, the selling security holders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The selling security holders may also sell shares of the common stock short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The selling security holders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). The selling security holders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. Each selling security holder has informed us that it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the common stock. In no event shall any broker-dealer receive fees, commissions and markups which, in the aggregate, would exceed eight percent (8%). 76 We are required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by us incident to the registration of the shares. We have agreed to indemnify the selling security holders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Because selling security holders may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act including Rule 172 thereunder. In addition, any securities covered by this prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus. There is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale shares by the selling security holders. We agreed to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the shares may be resold by the selling security holders without registration and without regard to any volume limitations by reason of Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the shares have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. The resale shares will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale shares may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with. Under applicable rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale shares may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the common stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the selling security holders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of shares of the common stock by the selling security holders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the selling security holders and have informed them of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act). Shares Eligible For Future Sale At March 31, 2008 we had 52,544,603 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, of which approximately 51,067,585 shares are restricted securities In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, a person, or person whose shares are aggregated, who is not our affiliate or has not been an affiliate during the prior three months and owns shares that were purchased from us, or any affiliate, at least six months previously, is entitled to make unlimited public resales of such shares provided there is current public information available at the time of the resales. After a one-year holding period a non-affiliate is entitled to make unlimited public resales of our shares without the requirement that current public information be available at the time of the resales. A person, or persons whose shares are aggregated, who are affiliates of our company and own shares that were purchased from us, or any affiliate, at least six months previously is entitled to sell within any three month period, a number of shares of our common stock that does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, subject to manner of sale provisions, notice requirements and the availability of current public information about us. Future sales of restricted common stock under Rule 144 or otherwise or of the shares which we are registering under this prospectus could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. We are unable to estimate the number of shares that may be sold in the future by our existing shareholders or the effect, if any, that sales of shares by such shareholders will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by existing shareholders could adversely affect prevailing market prices. 77 LEGAL MATTERS The validity of the securities offered by this prospectus will be passed upon for us by Schneider Weinberger & Beilly LLP.

F-4 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007 NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization The Company was incorporated on March 21, 2000 under the laws of the State of New Jersey under its former name Segway III. Prior to June 29, 2007, the Company was a development stage company attempting to implement our business plan to become a fully integrated online provider that links the supply and demand sides of the ground trucking industry. In November 2007, the Company filed a Certificate of Domestication in the State of Florida whereby the Company domesticated as a Florida corporation under the name Gold Horse International, Inc. On June 29, 2007, the Company executed a Share Exchange Agreement (Share Exchange Agreement) with Gold Horse International, Inc. (Gold Horse Nevada), a Nevada corporation, whereby the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Gold Horse Nevada in exchange for newly-issued stock of the Company to Gold Horse Nevada shareholders. Gold Horse Nevada was incorporated on August 14, 2006 in the State of Nevada. Under the Share Exchange Agreement, on June 29, 2007, the Company issued 48,500,000 shares of its common stock to the Gold Horse Nevada Stockholders and their assignees in exchange for 100% of the common stock of Gold Horse International. Additionally, the Companys prior President, CEO and sole director, cancelled 9,655,050 of the Companys common stock he owned immediately prior to the closing. After giving effect to the cancellation of shares, the Company had a total of 1,500,002 shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to Closing. After the Closing, the Company had a total of 50,000,002 shares of common stock outstanding, with the Gold Horse Nevada Stockholders and their assignees owning 97% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the Companys common stock. Gold Horse Nevada became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and Gold Horse Nevadas former shareholders own the majority of the Companys voting stock. Gold Horse Nevada owns 100% of Global Rise International, Limited (Global Rise), a Cayman Islands corporation incorporated on May 9, 2007. Through Global Rise, Gold Horse Nevada operates, controls and beneficially owns the construction, hotel and real estate development businesses in China under a series of contractual arrangements (the Contractual Arrangements) with Inner Mongolia Jin Ma Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. (Jin Ma Real Estate), Inner Mongolia Jin Ma Construction Co., Ltd. (Jin Ma Construction) and Inner Mongolia Jin Ma Hotel Co., Ltd. (Jin Ma Hotel), (collectively referred to as the Jin Ma Companies). Other than the Contractual Arrangements with the Jin Ma Companies, the Company, Gold Horse Nevada or Global Rise has no business or operations. The Contractual Arrangements are discussed below. On October 10, 2007, the Company established Inner Mongolia (Cayman) Technology & Development Ltd. (IMTD), a wholly-foreign owned enterprise incorporated in the PRC and wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Rise, F-5 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007 The relationship among the above companies as follows: As a result of these Contractual Agreements, the acquisition of Gold Horse Nevada and the Jin Ma Companies by the Company was accounted for as a reverse merger because on a post-merger basis, the former shareholders of Gold Horse Nevada held a majority of the outstanding common stock of the Company on a voting and fully-diluted basis. As a result, Gold Horse Nevada is deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statement data presented are those of the Jin Ma Companies for all periods prior to the Companys acquisition of Gold Horse Nevada on June 29, 2007, and the financial statements of the consolidated companies from the acquisition date forward. PRC law currently places certain limitations on foreign ownership of Chinese companies. To comply with these foreign ownership restrictions, the Company operates its business in China through the Jin Ma Companies, each of which is a limited liability company headquartered in Hohhot, the capital city of the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia in China, and organized under PRC laws. Each of the Jin Ma Companies has the relevant licenses and approvals necessary to operate the Companys businesses in China. The Company has Contractual Arrangements with each of the Jin Ma Companies and their shareholders (collectively the Jin Ma Companies Shareholders) pursuant to which the Company provides business consulting and other general business operation services to the Jin Ma Companies. Through these Contractual Arrangements, the Company also has the ability to control the daily operations and financial affairs of the Jin Ma Companies, appoint each of their senior executives and approve all matters requiring shareholder approval. As a result of these Contractual Arrangements, which enable the Company to control the Jin Ma Companies, the Company is considered the primary beneficiary of the Jin Ma Companies. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the Jin Ma Companies results, assets and liabilities in its financial statements The Contractual Arrangements are comprised of a series of agreements, including a Consulting Services Agreement and an Operating Agreement, through which the Company has the right to advise, consult, manage and operate each of the Jin Ma Companies, and collect and own all of their respective net profits. Additionally, under a Shareholders Voting Rights Proxy Agreement, the Jin Ma Companies Shareholders have vested their voting control over the Jin Ma Companies to the Company. In order to further reinforce the Companys rights to control and operate the Jin Ma Companies, these companies and their shareholders have granted the Company, under an Option Agreement, the exclusive right and option to acquire all of their equity interests in the Jin Ma Companies or, alternatively, all of the assets of the Jin Ma Companies. Further the Jin Ma Companies Shareholders have pledged all of their rights, titles and interests in the Jin Ma Companies to the Company under an Equity Pledge Agreement.

The Companys relationships with the Jin Ma Companies and their respective shareholders are governed by the Contractual Arrangements. Under PRC laws, each of Gold Horse International, Gold Horse Nevada, Global Rise, Jin Ma Real Estate, Jin Ma Construction and Jin Ma Hotel is an independent legal person and none of them is exposed to liabilities incurred by the other party.

Each of the Jin Ma Companies, in return, agrees to pledge its accounts receivable and all of its assets to the Company. Moreover, each of the Jin Ma Companies agrees that without the Companys prior consent, it will not engage in any transactions that could materially affect its assets, liabilities, rights or operations, including, without limitation, incurrence or assumption of any indebtedness, sale or purchase of any assets or rights, incurrence of any encumbrance on any of its assets or intellectual property rights in favor of a third party or transfer of any agreements relating to its business operation to any third party.

The shareholders of the Jin Ma Companies agreed not to dispose of the pledged equity interests or take any actions that would prejudice our interest. The equity pledge agreement will expire two (2) years after the Jin Ma Companies obligations under the exclusive consulting services agreements have been fulfilled.

Basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companys functional currency is the Chinese Renminbi; however the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated and presented in United States Dollars ($). In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary to present fairly its financial position as of December 31, 2007, the results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, and cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The operating results for the six month period ended December 31, 2007 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2008. The audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2007 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission are hereby referenced. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis and financial statements and notes thereto included in the Companys 2007 Form 10-KSB. F-8 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007 Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and present the financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Speedhaul Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries Gold Horse Nevada and Global Rise, and its variable interest entities Jin Ma Construction, Jin Ma Hotel and Jin Ma Real Estate. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company has adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R), an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. FIN 46R requires a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIEs residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which the Company, through contractual arrangements, bears the risks of, and enjoys the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entities, and therefore the Company is the primary beneficiary of these entities. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates for the six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 include the allowance for doubtful accounts, the useful life of property and equipment, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings. Accounts and other receivables The Company has a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on its best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company periodically reviews its accounts receivable and other receivables to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. At December 31 and June 30, 2007, the Company has established, based on a review of its outstanding accounts receivable balances, an allowance for doubtful accounts in the amount of $1,020,191 and $740,338, respectively, on its total accounts receivable. Additionally, at December 31 and June 30, 2007, the Company has established, based on a review of its outstanding other receivable balances, an allowance for doubtful accounts in the amount of $859,257 and $923,803, respectively. Inventories Inventories, consisting of construction materials and consumable goods related to the Companys operations are stated at the lower of cost or market utilizing the first-in, first-out method. F-9 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007 Advances to suppliers The Company advances to certain vendors for purchase of its material. The advances to suppliers are interest free and unsecured. The advances to suppliers amounted to $1,344,552 and $198,113, respectively, as at December 31 and June 30, 2007. Property and equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition. Depreciation is computed using straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from five to forty years. Real estate held for sale The Company capitalizes as real estate held for sale the direct construction and development costs, property taxes, interest incurred on costs related to land under development and other related costs (i.e. engineering, surveying, landscaping, etc.) until the property reaches its intended use. At December 31 and June 30, 2007, real estate held for sale amounted to $534,512 and $1,149,906, respectively. Costs in excess of billings Costs in excess of billings are stated at cost, unless events or circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value. Estimated fair value: (i) is based on the Companys plans for the development of each property; and (ii) considers the cost to complete and the estimated fair value of the completed projects. Direct construction, development costs, property taxes and other related costs to the construction projects are capitalized during periods those activities which are necessary to get the projects ready for its intended use. The capitalization ends when the construction is substantially completed and the projects are ready for its intended use. Advances from customers Advances from customers at December 31 and June 30, 2007 of $164,318 and $609,574, respectively, consist of prepayments from third party customers to the Company for construction and real estate transactions to ensure sufficient funds are available to complete the real estate and construction projects. The Company will recognize the deposits as revenue upon transfer of title to the buyer, in compliance with its revenue recognition policy. Impairment of long-lived assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, The Company periodically reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the assets estimated fair value and its book value. The Company did not consider it necessary to record any impairment charges during the six months ended December 31, 2007 and during the year ended June 30, 2007. F-10 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007 Income taxes The Company is governed by the Income Tax Law of the Peoples Republic of China and the United States. The Company utilizes SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. At December 31 and June 30, 2007, there were no significant book and tax basis differences. Pursuant to the PRC Income Tax Laws, the Company is subject to Enterprise Income Taxes (EIT) at a statutory rate of 33%, which comprises 30% national income tax and 3% local income tax. Earnings and diluted earnings per common share Earnings per share is calculated in accordance with the Statement of financial accounting standards No. 128 (SFAS No. 128), Earnings per share. SFAS No. 128 superseded Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.15 (APB 15). Net loss per share for all periods presented has been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 128. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period. The following table presents a reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings per share: Three Months ended December 31, Six Months ended December 31, 2007 2006 2007 2006 Net income $ 574,585 $ 603,215 $ 1,309,455 $ 525,106 Weighted average shares outstanding  basic 51,161,837 48,500,000 50,580,920 48,500,000 EPS  basic $ 0.01 $ 0.01 $ 0.03 $ 0.01 Net income $ 574,585 $ 603,215 $ 1,309,455 $ 525,106 Weighted average shares outstanding  basic 51,161,837 48,500,000 50,580,920 48,500,000 Effect of dilutive securities: Unexercised warrants 4,042,577  2,544,713  Convertible debentures 4,229,733  2,776,488  Weighted average shares outstanding diluted 59,434,147 48,500,000 55,902,121 48,500,000 EPS  diluted $ 0.01 $ 0.01 $ 0.02 $ 0.01 F-11 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007 Revenue recognition The Company follows the guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 for revenue recognition. In general, the Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The following policies reflect specific criteria for the various revenues streams of the Company: Real estate sales which primarily involve the sale of multi-family homes and community environments are reported in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. Profit from the sales of development properties, less 5% business tax, is recognized by the full accrual method when the sale is consummated. A sale is not considered consummated until (1) the parties are bound by the terms of a contract, (2) all consideration has been exchanged, (3) any permanent financing of which the seller is responsible has been arranged, (4) all conditions precedent to closing have been performed, (5) the seller does not have substantial continuing involvement with the property, and (6) the usual risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. Sales transactions not meeting all the conditions of the full accrual method are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting. Under the deposit method, all costs are capitalized as incurred, and payments received from the buyer are recorded as a deposit liability (reflected as advances from customers in the Companys consolidated balance sheets). Revenue from the performance of general contracting, construction management and design-building services is recognized upon completion of the service. Revenue primarily derived from hotel operations, including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales, is recognized when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. In accounting for long-term engineering and construction-type contracts, the Company follows the provisions of the AICPAs Statement of Position 81-1 Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts . The Company recognizes revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion. Contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised. This method of revenue recognition requires the Company to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule, the cost of materials and labor, and productivity; and the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes, and achievement of contractual performance standards which may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. The asset, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability, billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, represents billings in excess of revenues recognized. F-12 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007 Concentrations of credit risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade accounts receivable. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions in China. Total cash in state-owned banks at December 31, 2007 amounted to $2,548,041, of which no deposits are covered by insurance. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risks on its cash in bank accounts. A portion of the Companys sales are credit sales which are primarily to customers whose ability to pay is dependent upon the industry economics prevailing in these areas; however, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables is limited due to generally short payment terms. The Company also performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to help further reduce credit risk. Stock-based compensation The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Companys financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123(R). There were no options outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. Foreign currency translation and comprehensive income The reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company is the local currency, the Chinese Renminbi (RMB). The financial statements of the Company are translated into United States dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounts Standards (SFAS) No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, using year-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the period for revenues, costs, and expenses and historical rates for the equity. Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in determining comprehensive income. At December 31, 2007, the cumulative translation adjustment of $1,105,673 was classified as an item of other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. For the six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, accumulated other comprehensive income was $1,870,250 and $717,727, respectively. Segment reporting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 (SFAS 131), Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information requires use of the management approach model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a companys management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other manner in which management disaggregates a company. During the six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company operated in three reportable business segments - (1) the Construction segment (2) Hotel segment and (3) Real estate development segment (Refer to Note 11). Recent accounting pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which provides guidance for how companies should measure fair value when required to use a fair value measurement for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP). SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on its financial statements. F-13 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158 (SFAS 158), Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). This statement requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity. This statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions. The Company will be required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, or fiscal 2009 for the Company. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on its financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 , under which entities will now be permitted to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS 157. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS 159 will have on its financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. This Statement amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling (minority) interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 is effective for the Companys fiscal year beginning October 1, 2009. Management is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations. This Statement replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. This Statement retains the fundamental requirements in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (which Statement 141 called the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. This Statement also establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: a) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and c) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) will apply prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after Companys fiscal year beginning October 1, 2009. While the Company has not yet evaluated this statement for the impact, if any, that SFAS No. 141(R) will have on its consolidated financial statements, the Company will be required to expense costs related to any acquisitions after September 30, 2009.

The Company is subject to the payment to the holders liquidated damages if it fails to file the registration statement within 45 days from the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement, or if the registration statement is not declared effective within 120 days from the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement (or 150 days if the staff of the SEC reviews the filing), or if all the securities are not registered by April 30, 2008 as well as certain other events. The liquidated damages, which are payable in cash, will be calculated at 1.5% of the aggregate purchase price paid by each holder for every 30 day period, with a maximum of 18% of the aggregate purchase price. If the Company fails to pay all or any portion of these liquidated damages, they accrue interest at 18% per annum for a possible penalty of $589,500. The Company is obligated to pay all expenses associated with the registration statement, other than fees and expenses of the holders counsel, if any, any commissions payable by the holders on the sale of the underlying securities. The Company filed its registration on January 23, 2008 and has been notified by the staff of the SEC that it will receive a full review. As of December 31, 2007, pursuant to FASB Staff Position, or FSP, EITF 00-19-2, Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements, we have determined that it is unlikely that circumstances allowing for the aforementioned liquidated damages would arise, and therefore no contingent liability has been recorded. F-20 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007 In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 98-5 and EITF 00-27, the convertible notes were considered to have an embedded beneficial conversion feature (BCF) because the effective conversion price was less than the fair value of the Companys common stock. This convertible notes were fully convertible at the issuance date, therefore the portion of proceeds allocated to the convertible notes of $1,295,233 was determined to be the value of the beneficial conversion feature and was recorded as a debt discount and is being amortized over the 16-months note term. Pursuant to the terms of the Warrants, the Purchasers are entitled to purchase up to 6,345,930 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $0.50 per share. The Warrants have a term of 5 years after the issue date of November 30, 2007. These warrants were treated as a discount on the secured notes and were valued at $887,768 to be amortized over the 16-month note term. The fair market value of each stock warrant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in accordance with SFAS No. 123R using the following weighted-average assumptions: expected dividend yield 0%; risk-free interest rate of 3.41%; volatility of 25% and an expected term of five year. During the six months ended December 31, 2007, amortization of debt issue costs was $12,790. The remaining balance of debt issue costs at December 31, 2007 was $191,850 which will be amortized over the term of the debenture. The amortization of debt discounts for the six months ended December 31, 2007 was $136,437, which has been included in interest expense on the accompanying statement of operations. The balance of the debt discount is $2,046,563 at December 31, 2007 which will be amortized over the term of the debenture. The Company evaluated whether or not the secured convertible debentures contain embedded conversion options, which meet the definition of derivatives under SFAS 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and related interpretations. The Company concluded that since the secured convertible debentures had a fixed conversion rate of $0.344, the secured convertible debt was not a derivative instrument. The convertible debenture liability is as follows at December 31, 2007: Convertible debentures payable $ 2,183,000 Less: unamortized discount on debentures (2,046,563 ) Convertible debentures, net $ 136,437 NOTE 11  SEGMENT INFORMATION Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 (SFAS 131), Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information requires use of the management approach model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a companys management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other manner in which management disaggregates a company. During the six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company operated in three reportable business segments - (1) the Construction segment (2) Hotel segment and (3) Real estate development segment. The Companys reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products. The Companys reportable segments, although integral to the success of the others, offer distinctly different products and services and require different types of management focus. As such, these segments are managed separately. F-21 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC.

The purpose of the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan is to offer to the Companys employees, officers, directors and consultants whose past, present and/or potential contributions to the Company have been or are or will be important to our success, an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company. The issuance of grants under the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan will be made to persons who are closely related to the Company and who provide bona fide services to the Company in connection with its business. Under Federal securities laws, these services cannot be in connection with the offer of sale of the Companys securities in a capital raising transaction nor directly or indirectly promote or maintain a market for the Companys securities. The Company has currently reserved 3,000,000 of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock for issuance under the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan. Plan options may either be options qualifying as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or non-qualified options. In addition, the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan allows for the inclusion of a reload option provision, which permits an eligible person to pay the exercise price of the option with shares of common stock owned by the eligible person and receive a new option to purchase shares of common stock equal in number to the tendered shares. Any incentive option granted under the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan must provide for an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant, but the exercise price of any incentive option granted to an eligible employee owning more than 10% of our outstanding common stock must not be less than 110% of fair market value on the date of the grant. Any non-qualified option granted under the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan must provide for an exercise price of not less than the par value of our common stock. The term of each plan option and the manner in which it may be exercised is determined by the Board of Directors or the compensation committee, provided that no option may be exercisable more than 10 years after the date of its grant and, in the case of an incentive option granted to an eligible employee owning more than 10% of the common stock, no more than five years after the date of the grant. Unless the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan is approved by our stockholders by October 25, 2008, no incentive stock options may be granted and all incentive stock options that may have been previously granted shall automatically be converted into non-qualified stock options. Subject to the limitation on the aggregate number of shares issuable under the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan, there is no maximum or minimum number of shares as to which a stock grant or plan option may be granted to any person. Shares used for stock grants and plan options may be authorized and unissued shares or shares reacquired by us, including shares purchased in the open market. Shares covered by plan options which terminate unexercised will again become available for grant as additional options, without decreasing the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan, although such shares may also be used by us for other purposes. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has not made any grants under the 2007 Equity Compensation Plan. F-24 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Making up cumulative prior years losses, if any; 2. Allocations to the Statutory surplus reserve of at least 10% of income after tax, as determined under PRC accounting rules and regulations, until the fund amounts to 50% of the Companys registered capital; 3. Through December 31, 2005, allocations of 5-10% of income after tax, as determined under PRC accounting rules and regulations, to the Companys Statutory common welfare fund, which is established for the purpose of providing employee facilities and other collective benefits to the Companys employees; and 4. Allocations to the discretionary surplus reserve, if approved in the shareholders general meeting. In accordance with the Chinese Company Law, the Company allocated 10% of income after taxes to the statutory surplus reserve for the six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The amount included in the statutory reserves as of December 31, 2007 amounted to $752,931. F-25 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007 NOTE 14  OPERATING RISK (a) Country risk Currently, the Companys revenues are primarily derived from construction projects, real estate and hotel revenues to customers in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). The Company hopes to expand its operations to countries outside the PRC, however, such expansion has not been commenced and there are no assurances that the Company will be able to achieve such an expansion successfully. Therefore, a downturn or stagnation in the economic environment of the PRC could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition. (b) Products risk In addition to competing with other construction companies, real estate companies, and hotel operations, the Company competes with larger Chinese and international companies who may have greater funds available for expansion, marketing, buying power, resources, and the ability to attract more qualified personnel. These Chinese companies may be able to offer products at a lower price. There can be no assurance that the Company will remain competitive should this occur. (c) Political risk Currently, PRC is in a period of growth and is openly promoting business development in order to bring more business into PRC. Additionally PRC allows a Chinese corporation to be owned by a United States corporation. If the laws or regulations are changed by the PRC government, the Companys ability to operate the PRC subsidiaries could be affected. (d) Exchange risk The Company can not guarantee that the current exchange rate will remain steady, therefore there is a possibility that the Company could post the same amount of profit for two comparable periods and because of a fluctuating exchange rate actually post higher or lower profit depending on exchange rate of Chinese Renminbi (RMB) converted to U.S. dollars on that date. The exchange rate could fluctuate depending on changes in the political and economic environments without notice. NOTE 15  MAJOR CUSTOMERS & VENDORS One customer provided 51% of the Companys revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $ 1,648,526 of accounts receivable due from this customer. The Company uses five to seven subcontractors to perform its construction services and to develop its real estate projects. Management is aware of similar subcontractors that are available to perform construction services if required and management has plans to engage their services if necessary. NOTE 16  SUBSEQUENT EVENT On January 17, 2008, the Company issued 145,349 shares of common stock to its chief financial officer or his assignee for services rendered. The shares were fair value on the date of grant based on recent trading price. In connection with the issuance of these shares, the Company recorded compensation of $75,581. On January 17, 2008, the Company issued 180,000 shares of common stock to its directors for services rendered. The shares were fair value on the date of grant based on recent trading price of $0.52. In connection with the issuance of these shares, the Company recorded compensation of $93,600. F-26 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (FORMERLY SPEEDHAUL HOLDINGS, INC.)

(the Company, we, us, our) was incorporated on March 21, 2000 under the laws of the State of New Jersey under its former name Segway III. Prior to June 29, 2007, the Company was a development stage company attempting to implement our business plan to become a fully integrated online provider that links the supply and demand sides of the ground trucking industry. On June 29, 2007, the Company executed a Share Exchange Agreement (Share Exchange Agreement) with Gold Horse International, Inc. (Gold Horse), a Nevada corporation, whereby the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Gold Horse in exchange for newly-issued stock of the Company to Gold Horse shareholders. Gold Horse was incoporated on August 14, 2006 in the State of Nevada. Under the Share Exchange Agreement, on June 29, 2007, the Company issued 48,500,000 shares of its common stock to the Gold Horse Stockholders and their assignees in exchange for 100% of the common stock of Gold Horse. Additionally, the Companys prior President, CEO and sole director, cancelled 9,655,050 of the Companys common stock he owned immediately prior to the closing. After giving effect to the cancellation of shares, the Company had a total of 1,500,002 shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to Closing. After the Closing, the Company had a total of 50,000,002 shares of common stock outstanding, with the Gold Horse Stockholders and their assignees owning 97% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. Gold Horse became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and Gold Horses former shareholders own the majority of the Companys voting stock. Gold Horse owns 100% of Global Rise International, Limited (Global Rise), a Cayman Islands corporation incorporated on May 9, 2007.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2007 NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued ) As a result of these Contractual Agreements, the acquisition of Gold Horse and the Jin Ma Companies by the Company was accounted for as a reverse merger because on a post-merger basis, the former shareholders of Gold Horse held a majority of the outstanding common stock of the Company on a voting and fully-diluted basis. As a result, Gold Horse is deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statement data presented are those of the Jin Ma Companies for all periods prior to the Company's acquisition of Gold Horse on June 29, 2007, and the financial statements of the consolidated companies from the acquisition date forward.

Basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companys functional currency is the Chinese Renminbi; however the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated and presented in United States Dollars ($). Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and present the financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries including variable interest entities ("VIEs") for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Speedhaul Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries Gold Horse and Global Rise, and its variable interest entities Jin Ma Construction, Jin Ma Hotel and Jin Ma Real Estate. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company has adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46R"), an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. FIN 46R requires a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which the Company, through contractual arrangements, bears the risks of, and enjoys the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entities, and therefore the Company is the primary beneficiary of these entities. F-36 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (FORMERLY SPEEDHAUL HOLDINGS, INC.) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2007 NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued ) Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in 2007 and 2006 include the allowance for doubtful accounts and the useful life of property and equipment, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings. Fair value of financial instruments Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments", requires that the Company disclose estimated fair values of financial instruments. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and advances from customers approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. Cash and cash equivalents For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and money market accounts to be cash equivalents. Accounts and other receivables The Company has a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on its best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company periodically reviews its accounts receivable and other receivables to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. At June 30, 2007, the Company has established, based on a review of its outstanding accounts receivable balances, an allowance for doubtful accounts in the amount of $740,338. Additionally, at June 30, 2007, the Company has established, based on a review of its outstanding other receivable balances, an allowance for doubtful accounts in the amount of $923,803. Inventories Inventories, consisting of construction materials and consumable goods related to the Companys operations are stated at the lower of cost or market utilizing the first-in, first-out method. Advances to suppliers The Company advances to certain vendors for purchase of its material. The advances to suppliers are interest free and unsecured. The advances to suppliers amounted to $198,113 as at June 30, 2007. F-37 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (FORMERLY SPEEDHAUL HOLDINGS, INC.) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2007 NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued ) Property and equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition. Depreciation is computed using straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from five to forty years. Real estate held for sale The Company capitalizes as real estate held for sale the direct construction and development costs, property taxes, interest incurred on costs related to land under development and other related costs (i.e. engineering, surveying, landscaping, etc.) until the property reaches its intended use. At June 30, 2007, real estate held for sale amounted to $1,149,906. Advertising Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for the years ended June30, 2007 and 2006 were not material. Costs in excess of billings Costs in excess of billings are stated at cost, unless events or circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value. Estimated fair value: (i) is based on the Companys plans for the development of each property; and (ii) considers the cost to complete and the estimated fair value of the completed projects. Direct construction, development costs, property taxes and other related costs to the construction projects are capitalized during periods those activities which are necessary to get the projects ready for its intended use. The capitalization ends when the construction is substantially completed and the projects are ready for its intended use. Advances from customers Advances from customers at June 30, 2007 of $609,574 consist of prepayments from third party customers to the Company for construction and real estate transactions to ensure sufficient funds are available to complete the real estate and construction projects. The Company will recognize the deposits as revenue upon transfer of title to the buyer, in compliance with its revenue recognition policy. Impairment of long-lived assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," The Company periodically reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the assets estimated fair value and its book value. The Company did not consider it necessary to record any impairment charges during the year ended June 30, 2007. F-38 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (FORMERLY SPEEDHAUL HOLDINGS, INC.) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2007 NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued ) Income taxes The Company is governed by the Income Tax Law of the Peoples Republic of China and the United States. The Company utilizes SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. At June 30, 2007, there was no significant book and tax basis differences. Pursuant to the PRC Income Tax Laws, the Company is subject to Enterprise Income Taxes (EIT) at a statutory rate of 33%, which comprises 30% national income tax and 3% local income tax. Earnings and diluted earnings per common share Earnings per share is calculated in accordance with the Statement of financial accounting standards No. 128 (SFAS No. 128), Earnings per share. SFAS No. 128 superseded Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.15 (APB 15). Net loss per share for all periods presented has been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 128. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period. At June 30, 2007 and 2006, the Company did not have any common stock equivalents. Revenue recognition The Company follows the guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 for revenue recognition. In general, the Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The following policies reflect specific criteria for the various revenues streams of the Company: Real estate sales which primarily involve the sale of multi-family homes and community environments are reported in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 66, "Accounting for Sales of Real Estate". Profit from the sales of development properties, less 5% business tax, is recognized by the full accrual method when the sale is consummated. A sale is not considered consummated until (1) the parties are bound by the terms of a contract, (2) all consideration has been exchanged, (3) any permanent financing of which the seller is responsible has been arranged, (4) all conditions precedent to closing have been performed, (5) the seller does not have substantial continuing involvement with the property, and (6) the usual risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. Sales transactions not meeting all the conditions of the full accrual method are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting. Under the deposit method, all costs are capitalized as incurred, and payments received from the buyer are recorded as a deposit liability (reflected as advances from customers in the Companys consolidated balance sheets). F-39 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (FORMERLY SPEEDHAUL HOLDINGS, INC.) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2007 NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued ) Revenue from the performance of general contracting, construction management and design-building services is recognized upon completion of the service. Revenue primarily derived from hotel operations, including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales, is recognized when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. In accounting for long-term engineering and construction-type contracts, the Company follows the provisions of the AICPAs Statement of Position 81-1 Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts . The Company recognizes revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion. Contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised. This method of revenue recognition requires the Company to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule, the cost of materials and labor, and productivity; and the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes, and achievement of contractual performance standards which may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. The asset, "costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings," represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability, "billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings," represents billings in excess of revenues recognized. Concentrations of credit risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade accounts receivable. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions in China. Total cash in state-owned banks at June 30, 2007 amounted to $251,044, of which no deposits are covered by insurance. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risks on its cash in bank accounts. A portion of the Company's sales are credit sales which are primarily to customers whose ability to pay is dependent upon the industry economics prevailing in these areas; however, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables is limited due to generally short payment terms. The Company also performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to help further reduce credit risk. Stock-based compensation Effective September 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options based on their fair values. SFAS 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), which the Company previously followed in accounting for stock-based awards. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) to provide guidance on SFAS 123(R). The Company has applied SAB 107 in its adoption of SFAS 123(R). The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method as of and for the year ended June 30, 2007. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Companys financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123(R). There were no options outstanding as of June 30, 2007 and 2006. F-40 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (FORMERLY SPEEDHAUL HOLDINGS, INC.) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2007 NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued ) Foreign currency translation and comprehensive income The reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company is the local currency, the Chinese Renminbi (RMB). The financial statements of the Company are translated into United States dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounts Standards (SFAS) No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, using year-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the period for revenues, costs, and expenses and historical rates for the equity. Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in determining comprehensive income. At June 30, 2007, the cumulative translation adjustment of $544,878 was classified as an item of other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. For the years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, accumulated other comprehensive income was $453,154 and $108,493, respectively. Statement of cash flows In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows," cash flows from the Company's operations is calculated based upon the local currencies. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet. Segment reporting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 (SFAS 131), Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information requires use of the management approach model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a companys management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other manner in which management disaggregates a company. During the years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, the Company operated in three reportable business segments - (1) the Construction segment (2) Hotel segment and (3) Real estate development segment (Refer to Note 11). Recent accounting pronouncements In February 2006, FASB issued SFAS No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments". SFAS No. 155 amends SFAS No 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", and SFAF No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities". SFAS No. 155, permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation, clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 133, establishes a requirement to evaluate interest in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives, and amends SFAS No. 140 to eliminate the prohibition on the qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. This statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of the Company's first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The Company has not evaluated the impact of this pronouncement its financial statements. F-41 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (FORMERLY SPEEDHAUL HOLDINGS, INC.) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2007 NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued ) In March 2006, FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets - an amendment to FASB Statement No. 140. The new standard requires recognition of servicing assets in connection with any obligation to service a financial asset arising from 1) a servicing contract entered into as part of a transfer of assets meeting the requirements for sale accounting, 2) the transfer of assets to a special purpose entity in a guaranteed mortgage securitization where the transferor retains a controlling interest in the securitized asset, or 3) an acquisition or assumption of obligations to service financial assets not related to the servicer or its consolidated affiliates. The servicing assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value initially, if practicable, and the assets or liabilities must either be amortized or recorded at fair value at each reporting date. The statement allows a one-time reclassification for entities with servicing rights and subsequently requires separate presentation of servicing assets and liabilities at fair value in the statement of financial position. This statement is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after September 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted. The Company does not expect this implementation to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which provides guidance for how companies should measure fair value when required to use a fair value measurement for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP). SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on its financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158 (SFAS 158), Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). This statement requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity. This statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions. The Company will be required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, or fiscal 2009 for the Company. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on its financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 , under which entities will now be permitted to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS 157. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS 159 will have on its financial statements. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (SFAS 109). The interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity's financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. It prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Making up cumulative prior years' losses, if any; 2. Allocations to the "Statutory surplus reserve" of at least 10% of income after tax, as determined under PRC accounting rules and regulations, until the fund amounts to 50% of the Company's registered capital; 3.

Allocations to the discretionary surplus reserve, if approved in the shareholders' general meeting. F-47 GOLD HORSE INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (FORMERLY SPEEDHAUL HOLDINGS, INC.) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2007 In accordance with the Chinese Company Law, the Company allocated 10% of income after taxes to the Statutory surplus reserve for the years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006. . The amount included in the statutory reserves as of June 30, 2007 amounted to $594,006. NOTE 14  OPERATING RISK (a) Country risk Currently, the Companys revenues are primarily derived from construction projects, real estate and hotel revenues to customers in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). The Company hopes to expand its operations to countries outside the PRC, however, such expansion has not been commenced and there are no assurances that the Company will be able to achieve such an expansion successfully. Therefore, a downturn or stagnation in the economic environment of the PRC could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition. (b) Products risk In addition to competing with other construction companies, real estate companies, and hotel operations, the Company competes with larger Chinese and international companies who may have greater funds available for expansion, marketing, buying power, resources, and the ability to attract more qualified personnel. These Chinese companies may be able to offer products at a lower price. There can be no assurance that the Company will remain competitive should this occur. (c) Political risk Currently, PRC is in a period of growth and is openly promoting business development in order to bring more business into PRC. Additionally PRC allows a Chinese corporation to be owned by a United States corporation. If the laws or regulations are changed by the PRC government, the Company's ability to operate the PRC subsidiaries could be affected. (d) Exchange risk The Company can not guarantee that the current exchange rate will remain steady, therefore there is a possibility that the Company could post the same amount of profit for two comparable periods and because of a fluctuating exchange rate actually post higher or lower profit depending on exchange rate of Chinese Renminbi (RMB) converted to U.S. dollars on that date. The exchange rate could fluctuate depending on changes in the political and economic environments without notice. NOTE 15  MAJOR CUSTOMERS & VENDORS Three customers provided 20%, 36% and 15% of the Companys revenue for the year ended June 30, 2007 for an aggregate percentage of 71%. At June 30, 2007, the Company had $ 3,929,793 of accounts receivable due from these customers. Two customers provided 11% and 10.5% of the Companys revenue for the year ended June 30, 2006. For the year ended June 30, 2007, four vendors provided 24.7%, 12.6%, 19.2% and 19.2% of the Companys construction work. At June 30, 2007, the Company had $136,397 in accounts payable to theses vendors. The Company did not have any vendor concentrations in fiscal 2006. The Company uses five to seven subcontractors to perform its construction services and to develop its real estate projects. Management is aware of similar subcontractors that are available to perform construction services if required and management has plans to engage their services if necessary. NOTE 16  SUBSEQUENT EVENT From July to October 2007, the Company sold 1,468,458 shares of common stock to 67 individuals residing in China for net proceeds of $1,468,458 F-48 No dealer, sales representative or any other person has been authorized to give any information or to make any representations other than those contained in this prospectus and, if given or made, such information or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorized by the company or any of the underwriters.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers. The Florida Business Corporation Act permits the indemnification of directors, employees, officers and agents of Florida corporations. Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Florida Business Corporation Act. The provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act that authorize indemnification do not eliminate the duty of care of a director, and in appropriate circumstances equitable remedies such as injunctive or other forms of non-monetary relief will remain available under Florida law. In addition, each director will continue to be subject to liability for (a) violations of criminal laws, unless the director had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was lawful or had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, (b) deriving an improper personal benefit from a transaction, (c) voting for or assenting to an unlawful distribution and (d) willful misconduct or conscious disregard for our best interests in a proceeding by or in the right of a shareholder. The statute does not affect a directors responsibilities under any other law, such as the Federal securities laws. The effect of the foregoing is to require our company to indemnify our officers and directors for any claim arising against such persons in their official capacities if such person acted in good faith and in a manner that he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling our company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the act and is therefore unenforceable. Item 25. Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution. The estimated expenses payable by us in connection with the distribution of the securities being registered are as follows: SEC Registration and Filing Fee $ 147 Legal Fees and Expenses* 30,000 Accounting Fees and Expenses* 7,500 Financial Printing* 2,500 Transfer Agent Fees* 500 Blue Sky Fees and Expenses* 500 Miscellaneous* 223 TOTAL $ 41,370 * Estimated II-1 Item 26.

No general solicitation or advertising was used in connection with any transaction, and the certificate evidencing the securities that were issued contained a legend restricting their transferability absent registration under the Securities Act or the availability of an applicable exemption therefrom. Unless specifically set forth below, no underwriter participated in the transaction and no commissions were paid in connection with the transactions. On June 29, 2007, pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we issued 48,500,000 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Gold Horse Nevada in exchange for 100% of the outstanding shares of Gold Horse Nevada. The issuance of these shares was exempt from registration pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933. We made this determination based on the representations of Gold Horse Nevada shareholders, which included, in pertinent part, that such shareholders were not a U.S. person as that term is defined in Rule 902(k) of Regulation S under the Securities Act, and that such shareholders were acquiring our common stock, for investment purposes for their own respective accounts and not as nominees or agents, and not with a view to the resale or distribution thereof, and that such shareholders understood that the shares of our common stock may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or an applicable exemption therefrom.

We did not pay any commissions, placement agent fees, finders fee or other compensation in the transaction and we intend to use the proceeds from this offering for property acquisitions and general working capital.

Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the small business issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the small business issuer has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the small business issuer of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the small business issuer in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the small business issuer will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
