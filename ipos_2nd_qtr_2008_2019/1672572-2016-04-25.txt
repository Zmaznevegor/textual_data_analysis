Basic and dilutive securities in our basic and diluted EPS calculation are for the period from January 28, 2016 to March 31, 2016.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for Payments and other fees, income taxes and share-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our condensed financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. &nbsp 16 Back to Table of Contents &nbsp Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. The Corporation started to run its business since March 26, 2016, so the Corporation shall provide, in the register statement, quantitative information about market risk as of the end of March 31, 2016, and the period was from January 28, 2015 to March 31, 2016. Interest Rate Risk Our have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, and indebtedness. As of March 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were $1,938, short-term investments were $56, long-term investments were $0, short-term restricted cash and investments were $0, long-term restricted cash and investments were $0, and indebtedness were $0. All these investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. The changes in interest rates don't impact the earnings of the Corporation. A hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would not impact annual pre-tax earnings as of March 31, 2016, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments. As of March 31, 2016, we had $0 in outstanding debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in long-term interest rates would not impact annual pre-tax earnings as of March 31, 2016, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. F oreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 1. Market Risk for Trading Purpose The Corporation will be using US dollars to trade the spot gold and the spot silver, so the Corporation isn't subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. 2. Market Risk for Other than Trading Purpose The Corporation will be using US dollars to trade the spot gold and the spot silver, so the Corporation isn't subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. 3. Credit Risk We are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a brokerages default. We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the brokerages with which we make our trading. An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of brokerages. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of brokerages. For a summary of the risks associated with this investment activity and how these risks are mitigated, see "Risk Factors" in the registered statement. Impact of Inflation We have not been adversely affected by inflation when we are trading the spot gold and the spot silver. In the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our business, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.
