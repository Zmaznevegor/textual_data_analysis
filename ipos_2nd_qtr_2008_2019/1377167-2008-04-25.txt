You should not assume that the information in this prospectus or any prospectus supplement is accurate as of any date other than the date on the front page of those documents.

PROSPECTUS SUMMARY Use of Names Throughout this prospectus, the terms "we," "us," "our" issuer registrant Kat and "our company" refers to Kat Racing, Inc. The Company KAT Racing (KAT or the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 5, 2005. KAT is a development stage company with a primary business objective of marketing and selling cost-effective and innovative off-road cars for any level of off-road enthusiast - from the highly skilled racer to the unsophisticated recreational driver. To date, we have only sold chassis and parts. We have built one vehicle but have not yet sold it. We have not yet secured any expectation of regular substantive sales volume. We have generated significant losses from operations in part because of this lack of sales volume. In order to continue as a going concern and achieve a profitable level of operations, we will need, among other things, additional capital resources and a consistent source of revenues. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully accomplish the business plan as described herein and attain profitable operations. The auditor who audited our financial statements has expressed considerable doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our Facilities Our corporate offices are located at 3227 Meade Ave., Suite 3A, Las Vegas, Nevada 89102. Our telephone number is 702-525-2024. Our principal website may be found at www.katracing.net. The Offering The offering consists of shares offered by the selling stockholders and shares to be newly issued. The selling stockholders are offering 5,749,000 shares, or 100%, of our issued and outstanding common stock as soon as practicable after this Registration Statement becomes effective. The new issue shares will be sold at $0.05 per share. The selling shareholders will sell at a price of $0.05 per share until the shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or in another quotation medium and, thereafter, at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. There is no public market for our common stock. To date, we have made no effort to obtain listing or quotation of our securities on a national stock exchange or association. We have not identified or approached any broker/dealers with regard to assisting us to apply for such listing. We are unable to estimate when we expect to undertake this endeavor. In the absence of being listed, no market is available for inves tors in our common stock to sell their shares. We cannot guarantee that a meaningful trading market will develop. The offering price of $0.05 for the common stock being registered for hereby is what the selling shareholders had paid for their shares. The proceeds of the selling shareholder offering will go directly to the selling stockholders. None of those proceeds will be available to KAT Racing. Only proceeds from the new issue shares will be available to KAT Racing. 5 Our Transfer Agent is Pacific Stock Transfer Company, 500 E. Warm Springs, Suite 240, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119, telephone number (702) 361-3033. We will pay all costs and expenses relating to the registration of its common stock, but the selling stockholders will be responsible for any related commissions, taxes, attorney's fees and related charges in connection with the offer and sale of the shares. The selling stockholders may sell their common stock through one or more broker/dealers, and such broker/dealers may receive compensation in the form of commissions. Those costs must be paid by the selling shareholders. The purchase of the common stock in this offering involves a high degree of risk. The common stock offered in this prospectus is for investment purposes only and currently no market for our common stock exists. Please refer to "Risk Factors" on page 8 and section entitled "Dilution" before making an investment in this stock.

While these are all known material risks and uncertainties we face, you should know that they are not the only ones facing us. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In these circumstances, the value of our Securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our securities. An investment in the securities offered hereby involves a very high degree of risk and should not be made by persons who cannot afford the loss of their entire investment. The following factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this document, should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company and its business. The order of presentation of each risk factor is not indicative of the relative importance of such factor. 7 Investment in the securities offered hereby involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors of substantial financial means who have no need for immediate liquidity in their investments and who can afford to lose their entire investment. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors: FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN ARE DEEMED BY THE COMPANY TO BE COVERED BY, AND TO QUALIFY FOR, THE SAFE HARBOR PROTECTION PROVIDED BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 (THE 1995 ACT). INVESTORS AND PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT SEVERAL FACTORS GOVERN WHETHER ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CONTAINED HEREIN WILL, OR CAN BE, ACHIEVED. ANY ONE OF THOSE FACTORS COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE PROJECTED HEREIN. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE PLANS AND OBJECTIVES OF MANAGEMENT FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS, INCLUDING PLANS AND OBJECTIVES RELATING TO THE PRODUCTS AND THE FUTURE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY. ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO THE FOREGOING INVOLVE JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUTURE ECONOMIC, COMPETITIVE AND MARKET CONDITIONS, FUTURE BUSINESS DECISIONS, AND THE TIME AND MONEY REQUIRED TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT ACCURATELY, AND MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN ARE REASONABLE, ANY OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS COULD PROVE INACCURATE AND, THEREFORE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE RESULTS CONTEMPLATED IN ANY OF THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN WILL BE REALIZED. BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS, THE IMPACT OF WHICH MAY CAUSE THE COMPA NY TO ALTER ITS MARKETING, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PLANS OR OTHER BUDGETS, WHICH MAY IN TURN AFFECT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN LIGHT OF THE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDED HEREIN. THE INCLUSION OF ANY SUCH STATEMENT SHOULD NOT BE REGARDED AS A REPRESENTATION BY THE COMPANY OR ANY OTHER PERSON THAT THE OBJECTIVES OR PLANS OF THE COMPANY WILL BE ACHIEVED. Investment in the securities offered hereby involves certain risks and is suitable only for investors of substantial financial means. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this prospectus, before making an investment decision concerning the common stock. PARTICIPATION IS SUBJECT TO RISKS OF INVESTING IN MICRO CAPITALIZATION COMPANIES KAT believes that certain micro capitalization companies have significant potential for growth, although such companies generally have limited product lines, markets, market shares and financial resources. The securities of such companies, if traded in the public market, may trade less frequently and in more limited volume than those of more established companies. Additionally, in recent years, the stock market has experienced a high degree of price and volume volatility for the securities of micro capitalization companies. In particular, micro capitalization companies that trade in the over-the-counter markets have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies. 8 COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS EFFECTING PRODUCTION We are subject to direct regulation by the Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency and Federal Trade Commission as well as other local, state and federal agencies. Compliance with the regulations established by these agencies is very costly and affects our manufacturing process. Any changes in the laws or regulations imposed on us by these agencies could significantly increase our production costs and could have a very negative effect on our business. CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING MAY EFFECT PURCHASES Purchases of recreational vehicles, such as our off-road vehicles are considered discretionary for consumers. Our success will therefore be influenced by a number of economic factors affecting discretionary consumer spending, such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, petroleum prices, and taxation rates, all of which are not under our control. Adverse economic changes affecting these factors may restrict consumer spending and thereby adversely affect our growth and profitability. RISK OF VEHICLE DEFECTS Our vehicles may have unanticipated defects which could require us to recall them. A product recall could delay or even halt production until we are able to correct any such defects. Recalls may also have a materially negative effect on our brand image and public perception of our vehicles and any other products we develop and thereby adversely effect our future sales .Such recalls or other defects would also require substantial expenditures to correct. LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR VEHICLES Given the nature of our products, we expect that we will be subject to potential product liability claims that could, in the absence of sufficient insurance coverage, have a material adverse impact on our business. Although we intend to obtain adequate insurance coverage prior to commencing substantive operations, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure or maintain adequate liability insurance to cover all product liability claims. As a new market entrant, any large product liability suits occurring early in our marketing efforts may significantly adversely affect our ability to market our vehicles. ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION LIABILITIES Our business operations and facilities, particularly those of our affiliate KAT METAL WORX, INC., are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with such laws and regulations, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated. There can be no assurance that future changes in such laws, regulations or the nature of our operations will not require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance in the future. Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in the termination of our operations, impositions of fines, or liabilities in excess of our capital resources. We do not maintain environmental liability insurance, and if we are required to pay the expenses related to any environmental liabilities, such expenses could have a material adverse effect on our operations. RISKS OF NON-APPROVAL FROM, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES We may be required to obtain approvals and make certifications regarding compliance with federal, state and local regulations regarding the noise, emissions and safety characteristics of our vehicles. In addition, our affiliate's manufacturing facility may be required to comply with environmental and safety standards. The potential delays and costs that could result from obtaining such regulatory approvals and complying with, or failing to comply with, such regulations could result in delays in vehicle assembly and adversely affect operating results. 9 RISK OF NOT BEING ABLE TO COMPETE WITH LARGER COMPANIES The market for the type of vehicles we manufacture is extremely competitive and we expect that competition will increase in the future. Our competitors include many large companies that have substantially greater market presence and financial resources than we do. We believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including: 1. design of high performance and quality vehicles; 2. market presence; 3. timely delivery of our vehicles; 4. competitive pricing policies; 5. the timing and introduction of our products and services into the market; and 6. our ability to keep up with existing and emerging industry trends. Current or increased competition may either prevent us from entering or maintaining a place in the vehicle manufacturing market. We cannot guarantee that we will have the financial resources or marketing and manufacturing capabilities to compete successfully. If we cannot successfully compete, we probably will be forced to terminate our operations. See "Business Competition". DEPENDENCE ON VEHICLE PARTS AND MATERIALS SUPPLIERS We rely on third party suppliers to produce the parts and materials we use to manufacture our vehicles. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to provide us with the parts and supplies, we will be unable to produce our vehicles. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to purchase the parts we need at reasonable prices or in a timely fashion. If we are unable to purchase the supplies and parts we need to manufacture our vehicles, we will experience severe production problems, which may possibly result in the termination of our operations. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NOT KEEPING OUR PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY CURRENT AND COMPETITIVE Our success depends on our ability to develop innovative competitive vehicles that meet changing customer demands. The off-road racing industry is subject to rapidly changing technology and emerging competition. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify new opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner, nor can we guarantee you that products developed by our competitors will not make our products non-competitive or obsolete. Also, we cannot assure you that we will have the capital resources or the ability to implement any new technology. RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCT LINE Our success depends on whether or not our products are accepted in the market. You should be aware that development stage companies introducing new products into the market are subject to a high level of uncertainty and risk. Because the market for our vehicles is new and evolving we cannot predict the size and future growth rate, if any, of the market. We cannot assure you that the market for our vehicles will develop or that demand for our vehicles will emerge or become economically sustainable. Market acceptance of our products depends on our ability to establish a brand image and a reputation for high quality, which will differentiate our brand of products from our competitors. There can be no assurance that our products will be perceived as being of high quality and differentiated from such other products, or that we will be successful in establishing our intended brand image. In addition, our management team has no experience manufacturing or marketing vehicles on a large s cale. Our management's lack of experience could result in the failure of our ability to sell our vehicles. RELIANCE UPON KEY PERSONNEL AND NECESSITY OF ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL KAT is largely dependent upon the personal efforts and abilities of existing management, especially Kenny Thatcher (President) and Julie Bauman (Secretary). The success of KAT will also be largely dependent upon the ability of KAT to continue to attract quality management and employees to help operate KAT as its operations may grow. 10 PROCEEDS OF SALE WILL NOT GO TO THE COMPANY None the net proceeds of this Offering will be available to the Company. Given the considerable doubt expressed by our auditors as to our ability to continue as a going concern, we are likely to require additional capital in the near future. The sale of the securities as registered hereby will not result in additional capital for use by the Company. We will need to secure additional financial resources or we will be forced to shut down. TRANSFERABILITY RESTRICTIONS Transfer restrictions may apply to all or some of the shares within this offering. Legal advice should be sought before any investment is made. ARBITRARY OFFERING PRICE The offering price of $0.05 per share of common stock was arbitrarily determined by KAT and is unrelated to specific investment criteria, such as the assets or past results of KAT's operations. In determining the Offering price, KAT considered such factors as the prospects, if any, of similar companies, the previous experience of management, KAT's anticipated results of operations, and the likelihood of acceptance of this Offering. Please review any financial or other information contained in this offering with qualified persons to determine its suitability as an investment before purchasing any shares in this offering. Primarily, we relied on the price at which the securities most recently sold. The Selling Shareholders purchased these shares at $0.05 per share. Unless an active trading market develops, and subsequent purchasers are will to purchase these shares at prices greater than $0.05 per share these Selling Shareholders are likely to sustain a loss on th eir investment. Anyone purchasing these shares from Selling Shareholders cannot be assured that even purchases prices substantially less than $0.05 per share; they too will not sustain a loss. COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS This Offering has not been registered under the Act in reliance upon an exemption provided therein. Further, the securities will be sold pursuant to exemptions from registration in the various states in which they are being offered. There can be no assurance that the Offering presently qualifies or will continue to qualify under such exemptions due to, among other things, the adequacy or accuracy of disclosure concerning KAT and its business made in connection with the applicable securities laws or regulations. However, KAT does not believe this Offering presently is or will be in violation of any such laws or regulations. If and to the extent suits for rescission are brought and successfully concluded for failure to register the securities, assets of KAT could be adversely affected, thus jeopardizing the ability of KAT to operate successfully. Further, the expenditure of KAT's capital in defending an action by investors or by federal or state authorities, even where KAT is ultim ately successful, could have a material adverse effect on KAT's business prospects. INVESTORS MAY LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT IF KAT FAILS TO COMMENCE ITS BUSINESS PLAN. KAT Racing was formed in December 2005. KAT has no demonstrable operations record, on which you can evaluate the business and its prospects. To date, we have generated only nominal revenues and may incur losses in the foreseeable future. KAT's prospects must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development. These risks include, without limitation, competition, the absence of ongoing revenue streams, inexperienced management and lack of brand recognition. KAT cannot guarantee that it will be successful in accomplishing its objectives. If we fail to implement and create a base of operations for our business, we may be forced to cease operations, in which case investors may lose their entire investment. 11 THE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE NO EXPERIENCE MANAGING A PUBLIC COMPANY. AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP OUR BUSINESS AND MANAGE OUR PUBLIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. Our operations primarily depend on the efforts of our officers and directors. They have no experience related to public company management or as a principal accounting or principal financial officer. Additionally, neither of the officers nor directors have any career experience related to this type of business with the exception of one who is a metal fabricator (KAT METAL WORX, INC.). Because of these factors, we may be unable to develop and implement our business and manage our public reporting requirements. We cannot guarantee you that we will overcome any such obstacles. INVESTORS HAVE LIMITED CONTROL OVER DECISION-MAKING BECAUSE OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONTROL A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. Our officers and directors own a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders could exercise substantial control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Such concentrated control may also make it difficult for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock in the event we enter into transactions, which require stockholder approval. In addition, certain provisions of Nevada law could have the effect of making it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. For example, Nevada law provides that not less than two-thirds vote of the stockholders is required to remove a director, which could make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of Directors. This concentration of ownership further limits the power to exercise control by the minority shareholders. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE SALES WITHOUT SALES, MARKETING OR DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES. We have not substantially commenced our planned operations and do not have any sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop a sales and marketing plan or to develop an effective chain of distribution. In the event we are unable to successfully implement these objectives, we may be unable to generate sales and operate as a going concern. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDING, WE MAY BE FORCED TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS. We have limited capital resources. To date, we have generated only nominal revenues. Unless we begin to generate sufficient revenues from our proposed off-road vehicle business to finance operations as a going concern, we may experience liquidity and solvency problems. Such liquidity and solvency problems may force us to go out of business if additional financing is not available. We have no intention of liquidating. In the event our cash resources are insufficient to continue operations, we intend to raise additional capital through offerings and sales of equity or debt securities. In the event we are unable to raise sufficient funds, we will be forced to go out of business and will be forced to liquidate. A possibility of such outcome presents a risk of complete loss of investment in our common stock. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, INVESTORS MAY FACE A COMPLETE LOSS OF THEIR INVESTMENT. KAT Racing has yet to commence its planned operations. As of the date of this Prospectus, KAT has had only limited start-up operations and generated no significant revenues. Taking these facts into account, our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in the independent auditors' report to the financial statements included in the registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part. If KAT's business fails, the investors in this offering may face a complete loss of their investment. 12 FUTURE ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY CAUSE INVESTORS TO BEAR A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF LOSS DUE TO IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION We are authorized to issue up to 95,000,000 shares of common stock. Presently, there are 5,749,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus. In the event we require additional capital, we may need to issue shares of our common stock in exchange for cash to continue as a going concern. There are no formal or informal agreements to attain such financing. We cannot assure you that any financing can be obtained or, if obtained, that it will be on reasonable terms. Any such future additional issuances of our stock will increase outstanding shares and dilute stockholders' interests. COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FROM COMPETITORS WITH MORE RESOURCES MAY CAUSE US TO FAIL TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS MODEL. KAT Racing is entering the off-road vehicle business, which is a highly competitive market segment with relatively low barriers to entry. Our expected competitors include larger and more established companies. Generally, our actual and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and marketing resources, as well as greater name recognition. Therefore, many of these competitors may be able to devote greater resources than KAT to sales and marketing efforts, expanding their chain of distribution and hiring and retaining key employees. There can be no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not develop or offer comparable or superior products to those expected to be offered by us. Increased competition could result in lower than expected operating margins or loss of market share, any of which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF QUALITY MERCHANDISE ON ACCEPTABLE COMMERCIAL TERMS BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM DISTRIBUTION AND MANUFACTURING AGREEMENTS. We intend to rely primarily on product manufacturers and third-party distributors to supply the materials required to produce our vehicles. Our business would be seriously harmed if we were unable to develop and maintain relationships with suppliers and distributors that allow us to obtain sufficient quantities of quality merchandise on acceptable terms. Additionally, we may be unable to establish alternative sources of supply for our products to ensure delivery of merchandise in a timely and efficient manner or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot obtain and stock our products at acceptable prices and on a timely basis, we may lose sales and our potential customers may take their purchases elsewhere. OUR REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN COULD SUFFER IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE OUR INVENTORY PROPERLY. Our business depends on our ability to anticipate our needs for products and our as yet unidentified supplier's ability to deliver sufficient quantities of products at reasonable prices on a timely basis. Given that we are in the development stage we may be unable to accurately anticipate demand and manage inventory levels that could seriously harm us. If predicted demand is substantially greater than consumer purchases, there will be excess inventory. In order to secure inventory, we may make advance payments to suppliers, or we may enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could adversely affect our gross margin. FAILURE BY US TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES COULD RESULT IN LACK OF SALES REVENUES AND MAY FORCE US OUT OF BUSINESS. Any change in the preferences of our potential customers that we fail to anticipate could reduce the demand for the off-road vehicles and off-road vehicle-related merchandise we intend to sell. Decisions about our focus and the specific products we plan to offer will often be made in advance of entering the marketplace. Failure to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences and demands could lead to, among other things, customer dissatisfaction, failure to attract demand for our proposed products and lower profit margins. 13 WE MAY LOSE OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS. Our operations depend substantially on the skills and experience of our officers and directors. We have no other full- or part-time employees. Furthermore, we do not maintain "key man" life insurance on this individual. Without an employment contract, we may lose our sole officer and director to other pursuits without a sufficient warning and, consequently, go out of business. Our officers and directors are involved in other business activities and they may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities. If a specific business opportunity becomes available, they may face a conflict in selecting between KAT and other business interests. We believe that they will not consider entering a similar line of business as we conduct; however, there can be no assurance of this. KAT has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts. CERTAIN NEVADA CORPORATION LAW PROVISIONS COULD PREVENT A POTENTIAL TAKEOVER, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. We are incorporated in the State of Nevada. Certain provisions of Nevada corporation law could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Because Nevada corporation law requires board approval of a transaction involving a change in our control, it would be more difficult for someone to acquire control of us. Nevada corporate law also discourages proxy contests making it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors other than the candidate or candidates nominated by our board of directors. THE COSTS AND EXPENSES OF SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE MAY INHIBIT OUR OPERATIONS. After the effectiveness of this registration statement, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The costs of complying with such requirements may be substantial. In the event we are unable to establish a base of operations that generates sufficient cash flows or cannot obtain additional equity or debt financing, the costs of maintaining our status as a reporting entity may inhibit out ability to continue our operations. YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR SHARES IN OUR COMPANY BECAUSE THERE IS NO PUBLIC MARKET FOR OUR STOCK. There is no public market for our common stock making the current and potential market for our common stock limited. To date, we have made no effort to obtain listing or quotation of our securities on a national stock exchange or association. We have not identified or approached any broker/dealers with regard to assisting us apply for such listing. We are unable to estimate when we expect to undertake this endeavor. In the absence of being listed, no market is available for investors in our common stock to sell their shares. We cannot guarantee that a meaningful trading market will develop. If our stock ever becomes tradable, of which we cannot guarantee success, the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the stock market may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which, without a direct relationship to the operating performance, may affect the market price of our stock. 14 INVESTORS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY LIQUIDATING THEIR INVESTMENT BECAUSE KAT STOCK IS SUBJECT TO PENNY STOCK REGULATION. The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker/dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange system). The penny stock rules require a broker/dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker/dealer also must provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker/dealer, and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from such rules; the broker/dealer must make a special written determination that a penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in any secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules, and accordingly, customers in Company securities may find it difficult to sell their securities, if at all. SOME OF OUR ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES ARE RESTRICTED UNDER RULE 144 OF THE SECURITIES ACT, AS AMENDED. WHEN THE RESTRICTION ON THESE SHARES IS LIFTED, AND THE SHARES ARE SOLD IN THE OPEN MARKET, THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Some of the presently outstanding shares of common stock, aggregating 5,749,000 shares of common stock, are "restricted securities" as defined under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and may only be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from registration, if available. Rule 144, as amended, is an exemption that generally provides that a person who has satisfied a one year holding period for such restricted securities may sell, within any three month period (provided we are current in our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act) subject to certain manner of resale provisions, an amount of restricted securities which does not exceed the greater of 1% of a company's outstanding common stock or the average weekly trading volume in such securities during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale. We currently have two shareholders who each own 34.79% of the issued shares, and together own a significant majority of the restrict ed shares, to wit, 69.58% of the aggregate shares of common stock. Thus, sales of shares by these individuals, whether pursuant to Rule 144 or otherwise, may have an immediate negative effect upon the price of our common stock in any market that might develop. USE OF PROCEEDS Some of the shares being registered in this registration statement are issued and outstanding and held by the selling shareholders. The selling security holders will receive the net proceeds from the sale of their shares. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of these shares, although we have agreed to pay the expenses related to the registration of such shares. An additional 2,000,000 shares are being sold by the company. 100% of these proceeds will go to the company under the following use of proceeds. The net proceeds will be uses as follows: Website Development $15,000 Internet $1,500 Marketing and advertising $21,500 Legal and accounting $15,000 Product Development $37,000 General Operations $10,000 TOTAL $100,000 15 DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE As there is no public market for our shares, we used the price of $0.05 per share, which is what the selling shareholders had paid for their shares, as the benchmark-offering price. No other factors than what the selling shareholders paid for their shares were used to determine the offering price per share of this offering. The offering price of the common stock has been arbitrarily determined and bears no relationship to any objective criterion of value. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, historical earnings or net worth. The selling shareholders will sell at a price of $0.05 per share until the shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board; or in another quotation medium and, thereafter, at prevailing market prices or at privately negotiated prices. To date, we have made no effort to obtain listing or quotation of our securities on a national stock exchange or association. We have not identified or approached any broker/dealers with regard to assi sting us apply for such listing. DILUTION "Dilution" represents the difference between the offering price of the shares of common stock and the net book value per share of common stock immediately after completion of the offering. "Net book value" is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities from total assets. Our net book value on March 31, 2008 was $66,354. Assuming all 2,000,000 shares offered are sold, and in effect Kat receive the maximum estimated proceeds of this offering from shareholders, Kat net book value will be approximately $0.021 per share. Therefore, any investor will incur an immediate and substantial dilution of approximately $0.029 per share while the Kat present stockholder will receive an increase of $0.010 per share in the net tangible book value of the shares that he holds. This will result in a 58.00%% dilution for purchasers of stock in this offering. The following table illustrates the dilution to the purchaser of the common stock in this offering for both maximum proceeds as summarized above and minimum proceeds. MAXIMUM Offering Price Per Share $0.05 Net tangible book value before Offering (Per Share) -$0.011 Net tangible book value after Offering (Per Share) $0.021 Increase per share attributable to New Stockholders $0.010 Dilution in Offering Price based upon New BVPS $0.029 Dilution as percentage of purchase price 58.00% Percent Owned by Founders with Maximum Offering: 70.37% Percent Owned by prospective subscribers with Max.

The shares were issued at a price of $0.05 per share for total cash in the amount of $287,450. The shares bear a restrictive transfer legend. These transactions (a) involved no general solicitation, (b) involved less than thirty-five non-accredited purchasers and (c) relied on a detailed disclosure document to communicate to the investors all material facts about KAT Racing, including an audited balance sheet and reviewed statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows. None of the selling stockholders has been affiliated with KAT Racing in any capacity in the past three years. None of the selling stockholders is a broker/dealer or an affiliate of a broker/dealer. 17 Notes: This chart assumes the sale of all 5,749,000 offered in this prospectus. * An asterisk identifies the individual(s) who have voting and dispositive power over the entity identified.

Our common stock is currently held amongst a small community of shareholders. Therefore, the current and potential market for our common stock is limited and the liquidity of our shares may be severely limited. To date, we have made no effort to obtain listing or quotation of our securities on a national stock exchange or association. We have not identified or approached any broker/dealers with regard to assisting us apply for such listing. We are unable to estimate when we expect to undertake this endeavor. In the absence of being listed, no market is available for investors in our common stock to sell their shares. We cannot guarantee that a meaningful trading market will develop. 18 If the stock ever becomes tradable, the trading price of KAT's common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various events or factors, many of which are beyond KAT's control. As a result, investors may be unable to sell their shares at or greater than the price they are being offered at. The selling stockholders may offer their shares at various times in one or more of the following transactions: 1. In the over-the-counter market; 2. On any exchange, which the shares may hereafter be listed; 3. In negotiated transactions other than on such exchanges; 4. By pledge to secure debts and other obligations; 5. In connection with the writing of non-traded and exchange-traded call options, in hedge transactions, in covering previously established short positions and in settlement of other transactions in standardized or over-the-counter options; or 6. In a combination of any of the above transactions. The selling stockholders may only offer and sell, from time to time, common stock using this prospectus in transactions at a fixed offering price of $0.05 per share until a trading market develops in our common stock, at which time the selling stockholders may sell shares at market prices, which may vary, or at negotiated prices. The selling stockholders may use broker/dealers to sell their shares. The broker/dealers will either receive discounts or commissions from the selling stockholders, or they will receive commissions from purchasers of shares. The selling stockholders may transfer the shares by means of gifts, donations and contributions. This prospectus may be used by the recipients of such gifts, donations and contributions to offer and sell the shares received by them, directly or through brokers, dealers or agents and in private or public transactions; however, if sales pursuant to this prospectus by any such recipient could exceed 500 shares, than a prospectus supplement would need to be filed pursuant to Section 424(b)(3) of the Securities Act to identify the recipient as a Selling Stockholder and disclose any other relevant information. We will include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement. Such prospectus supplement would be required to be delivered, together with this prospectus, to any purchaser of such shares. In order to comply with the applicable securities laws of certain states, the securities may not be offered or sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in such states or an exemption from such registration or qualification requirement is available and with which KAT and the selling stockholders have complied. The purchasers in this offering and in any subsequent trading market must be residents of such states where the shares have been registered or qualified for sale or an exemption from such registration or qualification requirement is available. Some of the selling stockholders may be eligible and may elect to sell some or all of their shares pursuant to additional exemptions to the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including but not limited to, Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, rather than pursuant to this Registration Statement. Under certain circumstances the selling stockholders and any broker/dealers that participate in the distribution may be deemed to be "underwriters" within the meaning of the Securities Act. Any commissions received by such broker/dealers and any profits realized on the sale of shares by them may be considered underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act. The selling stockholders may agree to indemnify such broker/dealers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. The selling stockholders will also be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and regulations under the Exchange Act, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of the shares by the selling stockholders. Furthermore, under Regulation M under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution or the sale of shares may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to our common stock for a period of two business days prior to the commencement of such distribution. All of the above may affect the marketability of the securities and the availability of any person or entity to engage in market-making activities with respect to our common stock. 19 The selling stockholders will pay all commissions, transfer fees, and other expenses associated with the sale of securities by them. The shares offered hereby are being registered by us, and we have paid the expenses of the preparation of this prospectus. We have not made any underwriting arrangements with respect to the sale of shares offered hereby. We do not intend to engage in any distribution efforts on behalf of any of the holders of our common stock other than providing for registration of the securities registered for sale with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Each of the selling stockholders is acting independently of us in making decisions with respect to the timing, manner and size of each with the distribution of the shares. The selling stockholders may only offer and sell common stock using this prospectus in transactions at a fixed offering price of $0.05 per share until a trading market develops in our common stock, at which time the selling stockholders may sell shares at market prices, which may vary, or at negotiated prices. There is no assurance, therefore, that the selling stockholders will sell any or all of the shares. In connection with the offer and sale of the shares, we have agreed to make available to the selling stockholders copies of this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement and have informed the selling stockholders of the need to deliver copies of this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement to purchasers at or prior to the time of any sale of the shares offered hereby. Our private inve stors held no influence on the decision to become a public reporting company. There is no current market for our shares There is currently no market for our shares. We cannot give you any assurance that the shares you purchase will ever have a market or that if a market for our shares ever develops, that you will be able to sell your shares. In addition, even if a public market for our shares develops, there is no assurance that a secondary public market will be sustained. The shares you purchase are not traded or listed on any exchange. We intend to have our common stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board ｮ . However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in finding a market maker who will be successful at having our shares quoted. Further, even assuming we do locate such a market maker, it could take several months before the market makers listing application for our shares is approved. The OTC Bulletin Board ｮ is maintained by the National Association of Securities Dealers (the NASD, now known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Autho rity (FINRA)). The securities traded on the Bulletin Board are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, these securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. Over-the-counter stocks are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange. Even if our shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board®, a purchaser of our shares may not be able to resell the shares. Broker-dealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in our shares because they will be considered penny stocks and will be subject to the penny stock rules. Rules 15g-1 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on FINRA brokers-dealers who make a market in a Penny stock. A penny stock generally includes any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. Under the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or Accredited investor (generally, an individual with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purc haser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. In addition, the penny stock regulations require the broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a broker-dealer is required to send monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the penny stock held in a customers account and information with respect to the limited market in penny stocks. 20 The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon broker-dealers may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our shares, which could severely limit the market liquidity of our shares and impede the sale of our shares in the secondary market, assuming one develops. We may sell some or all of our shares at a fixed price of $0.05 per share until our shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board ｮ and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. Sales by us must be made at the fixed price of $0.05 until a market develops for the stock. Certain Market Information This Offering is the initial public offering of our securities. Accordingly, there has been, and there currently is, no public trading market for our common stock. Although we intend to seek a listing for our common stock on the OTCBB ｮ , a public trading market may never develop or, if one develops, may not be sustained. There is no guarantee that an active trading market for our securities will develop. You will likely not be able to sell your securities if an active trading market for our securities does not develop. Further, we can give no assurance that such a market could be sustained if a trading market for our securities were to develop, nor that our securities offered hereby could be resold at their original offering price or at any other price. Any market for our securities that may develop will very likely be a limited one and, in all likelihood, be highly volatile. In any event, if our securities traded at a low price, many brokerage firms may choose n ot to engage in market making activities or effect transactions in our securities. Accordingly, purchasers of our securities may have difficulties in reselling them and many banks may not grant loans using our securities as collateral.

No Preferred shares have been issued. Common Stock Each share of common stock entitles its holder to one vote, either in person or by proxy, at meetings of stockholders. Stockholders are not permitted to vote their shares cumulatively. Accordingly, the holders of more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock can elect all of our directors. Holders of common stock have no preemptive or other subscription rights, conversion rights, redemption or sinking fund provisions. In summary, the holders of our common stock: 23 1. Have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available therefore, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors; 2. Are entitled to share ratably in all of assets available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of corporate affairs; 3. Do not have preemptive, subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights; and 4. Are entitled to one vote per share on all matters on which stockholders may vote. All shares of common stock now outstanding are fully paid for and non assessable and all shares of common stock which are the subject of this offering, when issued, will be fully paid for and non assessable. The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker/dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange system). The penny stock rules require a broker/dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker/dealer also must provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker/dealer, and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from such rules, the broker/dealer must make a special written determination that a penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These heightened disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the number of broker/dealers willing to make a market in KAT shares, reducing the level of trading activity in any secondary market that may develop for our shares, and accordingly, customers in our securities may find it difficult to sell their securities, if at all. Preferred Stock We are authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value. However, KAT has not issued any preferred stock to date. We have no current plans to neither issue any preferred stock nor adopt any series, preferences or other classification of preferred stock. The Board of Directors is authorized to (i) provide for the issuance of shares of the authorized preferred stock in series and (ii) by filing a certificate pursuant to the laws of Nevada, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, all without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Any shares of issued preferred stock would have priority over the common stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights. Any future issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the company without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the hold ers of common stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction, or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders. In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock. Although the Board of Directors is required to make any determination to issue such stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of stockholders, the Board of Directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that potentially some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock. The Board of Directors does not at present intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock, unless otherwise required by law or stock exchange rules. 24 Preemptive Rights No holder of any shares of our stock has preemptive or preferential rights to acquire or subscribe for any unissued shares of any class of stock or any unauthorized securities convertible into or carrying any right, option or warrant to subscribe for or acquire shares of any class of stock not disclosed herein. Non-Cumulative Voting Holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares, voting for the election of directors, can elect all of the directors to be elected, if they so choose, and, in such event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any of our directors. Cash Dividends As of the date of this prospectus, we have not paid any cash dividends to stockholders. The declaration of any future cash dividend will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon earnings, if any, capital requirements and financial position, general economic conditions, and other pertinent conditions. We do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in business operations. Warrants There are no outstanding warrants to purchase our securities. Options There are no options to purchase our securities outstanding. We may, in the future, establish an incentive stock option plan for our directors, employees and consultants. Admission to Quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board We intend to have a market maker file an application for our common stock to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board ® . However, we do not have a market maker that has agreed to file such application. If our securities are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board ® , a security holder may find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our securities. The OTC Bulletin Board ® differs from national and regional stock exchanges in that it (1) is not situated in a single location but operates through communication of bids, offers and confirmations between broker-dealers, and (2) securities admitted to quotation are offered by one or more Broker-dealers rather than the specialist common to stock exchanges. To qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board ® , an equity security must have one registered broker-dealer, known as the market maker, willing to list bid or sale quotations and to sponsor the company listing. If it meets the qualifications for trading securities on the OTC Bulletin Board ® our securities will trade on the OTC Bulletin Board ® . We may not now or ever qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board ® . We currently have no market maker who is willing to list quotations for our securities. Reports After this offering, we will furnish our shareholders with annual financial reports certified by independent accountants, and may, at our discretion, furnish unaudited quarterly financial reports. 25 Transfer Agent We have engaged the services of Pacific Stock Transfer Company. Their contact information is as follows: Pacific Stock Transfer Company 500 E. Warm Springs Suite 240 Las Vegas, Nevada 89119 Telephone number: (702) 361-3033 INTEREST OF NAMED EXPERTS AND COUNSEL No expert or counsel named in this prospectus as having prepared or certified any part of this prospectus or having given an opinion upon the validity of the securities being registered or upon other legal matters in connection with the registration or offering of the common stock was employed on a contingency basis, or had, or is to receive, in connection with the offering, a substantial interest, direct or indirect, in the registrant or any of its parents or subsidiaries. Nor was any such person connected with the registrant or any of its parents or subsidiaries as a promoter, managing or principal underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer, or employee. Michael Balabon, Esq., our independent legal counsel, has provided an opinion on the validity of our common stock. Michael Balabon, Esq. has been our legal counsel since inception. He has been retained for purposes of facilitating our efforts in securing registration before the Commission. The financial statements included in this prospectus and the registration statement have been audited Moore & Associates Chartered Accountants Professional Corporation, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to the extent and for the periods set forth in their report appearing elsewhere herein and in the registration statement, and are included in reliance upon such report given upon the authority of said firm as experts in auditing and accounting. Audit Committee We do not have a standing audit committee of the Board of Directors. Management has determined not to establish an audit committee at present because of our limited resources and limited operating activities do not warrant the formation of an audit committee or the expense of doing so. We do not have a financial expert serving on the Board of Directors or employed as an officer based on managements belief that the cost of obtaining the services of a person who meets the criteria for a financial expert under Item 401(e) of Regulation S-B is beyond its limited financial resources and the financial skills of such an expert are simply not required or necessary for us to maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting in light of the limited scope and simplicity of accounting issues raised in its financial statements at this stage of its development. DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION OF INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons under the above provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is unenforceable. ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 5, 2005. Please see section entitled "Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities" for capitalization history. As of the date of this registration statement, KAT has had only limited start-up operations and has not generated substantive revenue. 26 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS General Kat Racing designs markets sells and distributes custom off-road racing and recreational vehicles.

We design market, sell and distribute American-made, high performance off-road racing and recreational vehicles These products include our stock models summarized above, and vehicles built to our customers' specifications. We make use of a "just in time" approach ordering parts on an as-needed basis. This results in reduced inventory and minimizes our capital needs. We also believe that this made-to-order approach helps produce greater customer satisfaction and reduces the burden on our cash flow. Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to profitably develop our sales. We intend to accomplish the foregoing through the following milestones: 1. Complete our public offering. We believe this could take up to 180 days from the date the Securities and Exchange Commission declares our offering effective. We will not begin additional operations until we have closed this offering. We intend to concentrate all of our efforts on raising as much capital as we can during this period. 2. After completing the offering, we will immediately hire an outside web designer to begin development of our website for sales and begin negotiations with service providers to develop our network infrastructure and transaction processing systems. The negotiation of service providers and the development and maintenance of the website, network infrastructure and transaction processing systems will be ongoing during the life of our operations. Developing a workable version of our website will take approximately three months, and developing workable versions of our network infrastructure and transaction processing systems will take approximately six months. 30 3. Approximately 90 days after we complete our public offering, we intend to promote our website primarily through viral marketing, such as blogs, postings on online communities such as Yahoo!(R) Groups and amateur websites such as YouTube.com, and other methods of getting Internet users to refer others to our website by e-mail or word of mouth. We also intend to use search engine optimization, the marketing of our website via search engines by purchasing sponsored placement in search result, and to enter into affiliate marketing relationships with website providers to increase our access to Internet consumers. We believe that it will cost a minimum of $15,500 for our online marketing campaign. Marketing is an on-going matter that will continue during the life of our operations. A detailed breakdown of marketing costs for 12 months is set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. 4. Approximately 90 days after we complete our public offering, we intend to promote our parts and vehicles through auto and off road magazines. Distribution Methods of the Products The Internet lends itself well to the distribution of off-road vehicles and off-road vehicle-related merchandise due to its ability to provide pictures, information and purchasing capabilities direct to the consumer, at his or her leisure. Our website has not been fully developed at this point in time. This site will be the focal point of our sales operations and the principal method through which we will market, sell and distribute our products. We will have a showroom to physically display our products, but we fully expect that our website will have more traffic and be the initial medium to develop potential customer interest. We also take our vehicles to rallies and races for purposes of exposing our company and product line to potential customers and showcasing our innovative and cost conscious vehicles. Our goal is to produce what we believe is a superior U.S.-made high-performance off-road vehicle safe enough for the casual enthusiast but rugged enough for the professional racer. We use quality parts, materials and workmanship. We seek market share, both domestically and internationally. Marketing Our marketing program will focus on two major objectives: (1) corporate/product name identification; and (2) lead generation for private individual customer sales and potential distribution channels. Corporate product name and product identification will use advertising, promotions, public relations and participation in major off-road events. We also will sponsor racing teams and special promotional events and participate in major off-road enthusiasts shows, rallies and conventions. To establish our brand name among the off-road enthusiast public, we first unveiled our prototype, the "Big Daddy". We also hope to license certain of our trademarks on a broad range of consumer items assuming our brand name becomes a marketable commodity. Lead generation activities are intended to identify distribution partners potentially interested in promoting our product line. Our primary effort will be generating leads so dealers can sell our vehicles. We will identify geographic regions where off-road racing enthusiasts typically congregate including the American southwest. Depending upon the availability of capital resources, will use print media advertising and direct marketing to generate customer Print media advertising will focus on national off-road enthusiast magazines (typically with modest-sized, full color ads) and local newspaper ads together with dealers' local promotional activities. We will evaluate local radio and cable TV ads on a location-by-location basis depending on reach, frequency, and cost. We believe direct mail programs; including inexpensive give-always (such as promotional CD's, high quality posters and merchandise) can be cost-effective if focused on a local basis. Our ad and promotional campaigns will be available on our website. 31 Industry Background and Competitive Business Conditions Off-road racing is a format of racing where various classes of specially modified vehicles (including cars, trucks, vehicles, and buggies) compete in races through off-road environments. We intend to market sell and distribute custom-made off-road vehicles to racing enthusiasts and recreational drivers. We are a small, start-up company and have not generated significant revenue. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, as well as established manufacturing and supply chain systems, and greater financial, management, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. The off-road vehicle market overall is highly fragmented. Competitors range from multi-national entities to retailers serving a limited geographical region. The market for our products and services are highly competitive and there are no substantial barriers to entry. KAT Racing competes with other off-road vehicle providers for the limited disposable income of consumers. The recreational vehicle industry is highly competitive with a significant number of both large and small participants. The products we expect to sell compete with other off-road vehicle products within a comparable price range. We are a start-up company without a base of operations and presently lacking an ability to generate significant sales. As such, we currently compete unfavorably in the general marketplace. Unless we implement our planned operations and begin to generate revenues, we will not be able to continue as a going concern. Off-road racing began in the early 20th century. An early racing sanctioning body in North America was the National Off-Road Racing Association (NORRA). The body was formed in 1967 by Ed Pearlman. The first event was a race across the Mexican desert. The event was first called the Mexican 1000. Later became known as the Baja 1000. [2] The event is now sanctioned by SCORE International. SCORE International is an off-road sanctioning body in the sport of desert racing and is famous for its flagship event, the Baja 1000. SCORE races are held in United States and Mexico. In North America there are several other formats. There are races on a circuit of less than five miles (such as Crandon International Off-Road Raceway). These formal racing events are sanctioned by CORR (Championship Off-Road Racing). It is a sanctioning body for off-road racing in the United States. The CORR series hosts several racing events each year. In 2007 it will host seven events. These events are typically televised (taped delayed) on cable or satellite television channels specializing in such events. An off-road championship event is held at the Crandon International Off-Road Raceway - the "home of the world championship off-road race" since 1970. The CORR series hosts events organized in 9 divisions. There are 5 truck series: (1) Pro-4 (2) Pro-2 (3) Pro-Lite (4) Sportsman-2 (5) Sportsman Stock. There are 3 buggy classes: (1) 1.Super Buggy (2) 2.Single Buggy (3) 3.Light Buggy. The ninth series hosted by CORR is relatively new. It features off-road go-cart type vehicles referred to as Trophy Karts. The Baja 1000 is considered to be a cross- country rally race. Other notable rally races include the Paris-Dakar, Master Rally in Europe and Northern Africa. 32 Off-road racing events are also held in other formats beside cross-country rallies. There are races on a circuit of less than five miles (such as Crandon International Off-Road Raceway). These events are also sanctioned by CORR. Stadium racing, where offroad racing vehicles are used in a temporary offroad racetrack constructed inside a stadium. Is also gaining popularity, particularly because of the ease by which spectators might enjoy the sport. The general idea of "offroad racing" can also extend to include hill climbing or any other form of racing that does not occur on a specified, paved track. Kat Racing is headquartered in the heart of off-road racing, the Desert Southwest of the United States. Off-road racing fans and recreational enthusiasts flock to Las Vegas each year for such notable events including: (1) the SCORE Laughlin Desert Challenge; and (2) the SCORE Las Vegas Terrible's Cup II MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATIONS Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information Certain statements contained in this quarterly filing, including, without limitation, statements containing the words believes, anticipates, expects and words of similar import, constitute forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, readers of this prospectus and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and the Names of Principal Suppliers We obtain our supplies from national manufacturers and after market manufacturers of automotive parts, paints, and supplies. These supplies are readily available and there is no dependency on any single supplier. We have no need for long term supply contracts since material and parts cost are not the most significant factor to the cost of our completed work. Need for Government Approval Our business is subject to certain federal, state, and local government regulations, including those of the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and comparable state agencies that regulate emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds ("VOC") and other air contaminants, the Occupational Safety and Heal Administrations ("OSHA"), and regulations governing the disposal of oil, grease, tires, batteries, and the prevention of pollution. Although we believe we are in compliance with all of these agencies and government regulations, our failure to comply with such regulations could result in the termination of our operations, impositions of fines, or liabilities in excess of our capital resources. In addition, any changes in the laws or regulations imposed on us could significantly increase our costs of doing business and could have a negative impact on our business. Effect of existing or probable government regulations Our business operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Although our management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with such laws and regulations, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated. There can be no assurance that future changes in such laws, regulations or the nature of our operations will not require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance in the future. Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in the termination of our operations, impositions of fines, or liabilities in excess of our capital resources. We do not maintain environmental liability insurance, and if we are required to pay the expenses related to any environmental liabilities, such expenses could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 33 Number of total employees and number of full time employees KAT Racing is currently in the development stage. During the development stage, we plan to rely exclusively on the services of our officers and directors to set up our business operations. Currently, our officers and directors are involved in KAT business on a part-time basis and expect to devote a minimum of 15 hours per week to our operations. Each is prepared to dedicate additional time, as needed. At this time, there are no other full- or part-time employees. We do not expect to hire any additional employees over the next 12 months. Reports to Security Holders 1. After this offering, KAT Racing will furnish its shareholders, at their request, with audited annual financial reports certified by KAT's independent accountants. 2. After this offering, KAT will file periodic and current reports, which are required in accordance with Section 15(d) of the Securities Act of 1933, with the Securities and Exchange Commission to maintain the fully reporting status. 3. The public may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Our SEC filings will be available on the SEC Internet site, located at http://www.sec.gov. PLAN OF OPERATION Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations The following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including but not limited to those set forth under "Risk factors" and elsewhere in this prospectus. We undertake no obligation to update any information contained in these forward-looking statements. General Overview KAT Racing was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 5, 2005. KAT is a startup and has not yet realized any meaningful revenues. Our efforts, to date, have focused primarily on the development and implementation of our business plan. No development-related expenses have been or will be paid to affiliates of KAT. As of the date of this filing we have approximately $2,500 in cash. We do not pay salaries nor do we have significant fixed costs. We have had difficulty successfully marketing our products and as a result have not generated the revenues we expected to after inception. As a result we are redesigning our products such that we might be able to offer a lower cost model more affordable to the beginning enthusiast of moderate income. We expect the price point for this entry-level model to range from $14,000  20,000. We believe that if we can successfully market and sell such a vehicle our cash flow needs will not require additional capital. If we cannot implement this strategy effectively we will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months. We have no plans or identifiable sources for additional capital. We have conducted informal product research are in the process of developing this entry-level model. We cannot be certain that it will be commercially marketable or accepted by our target consumers. Essentially we have retooled our Mini 4 vehicle. Its specifications as presently marketed are as follows: 34 Mini 4 Chassis 1 Â¾ " x .120" - 4130 Chromoly and Mild steel tubing. Completely hand-crafted TIG-welded chassis. Four Seat Applications. Body Work Aluminum body Overall Length 162 inches Overall Width 80 inches Front and 86 inches Rear. Overall Height 60 inches Weight 1,800 lbs (dry) Wheelbase 136 inches Track 79 inches Front and 85 inches Rear Front Suspension Independent Double A-arm with 20 inches of travel. Rear Suspension Plated trailing arm with 18 inches of travel Steering Power assisted rack and pinion Tires Sand Tire Unlimited Tires. Brakes Four wheel disc brakes by CNC Fuel Capacity 20 Gallons Engine 1300 cc Suzuki Hayabusa Motor. Transmission Fortin, Albins or Mendeola Top Speed 75 mph We believe that by varying the various components used in assembling this vehicle and utilizing lees expensive parts we can drive the cost down to the consumer such that the resultant vehicle might only cost $15,000. This would result in a 20% profit margin for us. We do not expect to purchase any plant assets or any significant equipment. There are no expected significant changes in the number of employees, paid or unpaid. Since our incorporation, we have raised a total of $59,250 through private sales of our common equity. In December 2005, we issued 2,000,000 shares of our common stock to Julie Bauman, an officer and director, in exchange for cash in the amount of $5,000 and 400,000 shares to Kenny Thatcher, an officer and director, in exchange for cash in the amount of $2,000. Additionally, in March and June 2006, we sold an aggregate of 3,349,000 shares of our common stock to 27 parties for cash proceeds of $52,250. Our management believes that establishing our brand name is imperative to our ability to continue as a going concern. Establishing our presence on the Internet is critical to reaching a broad consumer base. As we begin to purchase inventory from off-road vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, we will update the website with e-commerce capabilities and post pictures and prices of the items. Once the website is enabled as a sales channel, it will be expected to serve as a primary method of generating sales. The site is anticipated to be the principal method through thru which potential customers can view the products we intend to carry and learn of the services we can provide. The $15,000 allocated to marketing and the development and maintenance of our website is expected to be sufficient for the next 12 months. We expect to continuously upgrade and refine the site as we deem necessary and as our funds permit. We plan to use the Internet for marketing and sales by advertising our website, and resultantly, our products, through the following two methods: 1. Banner Advertisements: We expect to place banner advertisements and/or links to our web site on the sites of others. Some web sites may charge us a fee to place our advertisements in highly visible areas. Other sites may agree to an affiliate relationship, where we would be allowed to place an ad on their site in exchange for placement of their advertisement on our site. We do not plan to enter into any affiliate relationships that would require us to pay a fee in addition to exchanging advertisements or links. As of the date of this prospectus, we have not begun to place banner advertisements or links on our website, nor have we entered into any affiliate relationships. 2. Search Engine Placement: In addition to banners and links, we expect to pursue search engine placement. For a fee, we will be able to submit our web site and various terms to describe our site with web portals such as Yahoo! or Google. We have not yet contacted any company regarding search engine placement because we have not yet established our web site. 35 Our proposed business is to sell off-road vehicles and related merchandise to consumers. We will not manufacture any products internally at this time. We will initially rely solely upon the efforts of outside sources to research, develop and refine all products, primarily our affiliate KAT METAL WORX, INC. From time to time we may utilize the services of other companies or individuals to assemble our vehicles. We have initially allocated approximately $20,000 toward purchasing saleable inventory. As we continue to sell merchandise, we plan to use a portion of generated cash flow to purchase additional products. Unless we begin to acquire inventory for sale, we will be unable to begin to generate revenues. However, we have not begun to purchase any items for sale, and thus have not generated any revenues. We expect to incur approximately $4,310 in expenses related to being a public reporting company. Although, our officers and directors have no specific experience managing a public company, we believe these funds will be sufficient to maintain our status as a reporting company with the SEC. We have budgeted $5,690 as general working capital for non-specific uses. We believe that these funds will allows us to cover costs that are as yet unforeseen and to take advantage of opportunities that may arise in the course of our business. Our management does not anticipate the need to hire additional full- or part- time employees over the next 12 months, as the services provided by our officers and directors appear sufficient at this time. Our officers and directors work for us on a part-time basis, and are prepared to devote additional time, as necessary. Our officers and directors, recognize that we are required to continuously file reports with the SEC and any exchange we may be listed on, and understand the resultant increased costs of being a public reporting company. They believe that investors are more agreeable to invest in a company that intends to become a public company rather than to remain private with no foreseeable exit strategy for shareholders. Thus, our officers and directors raised capital in the private placement offering completed in June 2005 with the intention of KAT Racing becoming a public reporting company. Our private investors held no influence on the decision to become a public company. In addition, our officers and directors believe that a benefit of being a public company is the access to capital markets. We believe that if additional funds are required to finance our continuing operations, we may be able to obtain more capital by pursuing an offering of equity or debt securities. We do not expect to incur research and development costs. We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. We currently do not own any significant plant or equipment that we would seek to sell in the near future. We have not paid for expenses on behalf of our director. Additionally, we believe that this fact shall not materially change. We do not intend to engage in a merger with, or effect an acquisition of, another company in the foreseeable future. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the notes to our financial statements, and of those policies, we believe that the following accounting policies involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations. Nature of Business Kat Racing, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 5, 2005. The Company is engaged in the principal business activity of manufacturing cost-effective and innovative off-road racing cars for any off-road enthusiast. The Company has not realized significant revenues to date and therefore is classified as a development stage company. 36 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Basic (Loss) per Common Share Basic (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Companys net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Companys net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no such common stock equivalents outstanding as of September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006. (Loss) Shares Basic (Loss) Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount For the Year Ended $ (24,316) 5,749,000 $ (0.00) For the Year Ended $ (14,120) 5,749,000 $ (0.00) Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured. Comprehensive Income The Company has no component of other comprehensive income. Accordingly, net income equals comprehensive income for the period ended September 30, 2007. Advertising Costs The Companys policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company had not incurred any advertising expense as of September 30, 2007. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes. Income Taxes The Company provides for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 Requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. The Companys predecessor operated as entity exempt from Federal and State income taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 37 Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. Accounting Basis The basis is accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company has adopted a September 30 fiscal year end. Inventory The Company accounts for inventory on the cost basis. Work in progress includes labor and over charges. The inventory is maintained on a first in- first out (FIFO) basis. The Companys inventory as of September 30, 2007 and 2006 was comprised of the following: Raw Materials $ 76,920 $ 45,520 Work in Progress -0- -0- Supplies -0- -0- Finished Goods -0- -0- Total $ 76,920 $ 45,520 Stock-based compensation. As of September 30, 2007, the Company has not issued any share-based payments to its employees. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123-R effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. Under this transition method, stock compensation expense includes compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted on or after January 1,2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123-R. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Where applicable, SFAS No. 157 simplifies and codifies related guidance within GAAP and does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is encouraged. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a significant effect on its financial position or results of operation. 38 In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on its financial reporting, and the Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of FIN 48 will have on its disclosure requirements. In March 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assetsan amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. This statement requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in any of the following situations: a transfer of the servicers financial assets that meets the requirements for sale accounting; a transfer of the servicers financial assets to a qualifying special-purpose entity in a guaranteed mortgage securitization in which the transferor retains all of the resulting securities and classifies them as either available-for-sale securities or trading securities; or an acquisition or assumption of an obligation to service a financial asset that does not relate to financial assets of the servicer or its consolidated affiliates. The statement also requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value, if practicable, and permits an entity to choose either the amortization or fair value method for subsequent measurement of each class of servicing assets and liabilities. The statement further permits, at its initial adoption, a one-time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities by entities with recognized servicing rights, without calling into question the treatment of other available for sale securities under Statement 115, provided that the available for sale securities are identified in some manner as offsetting the entitys exposure to changes in fair value of servicing assets or servicing liabilities that a servicer elects to subsequently measure at fair value and requires separate presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value in the statement of financial position and additional disclosu res for all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year. Management believes the adoption of this statement will have no immediate impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has accumulated deficit of $38,436 as of September 30, 2007. The Company currently has limited liquidity, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of managements efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have funded our operations primarily through limited operations and nominal revenue derived from the sale of common stock. We expect that the offering which is the subject of his registration statement will result in sufficient capital for the next 12 months of operations. If our operations over the course of the next 12 months does not result in enhanced revenue generation we may be obliged to raise additional capital in a public or private offering our securities. We do not anticipate securing capital through debt financing. 39 Operating activities Our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of our commission income from escrow companies or similar intermediaries in the real estate transaction closing process. Our cash outflows are also impacted by related compensation costs and client acquisition costs (marketing and advertising expenses and finders and referral fees). A number of non-cash items may be charged from time to time to expense and increase our net loss or decrease our net income. These items might include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, amortization of debt discounts and non-cash interest expense relating to any stock-based compensation charges.

(the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 5, 2005. The Company is engaged in the principal business activity of manufacturing cost-effective and innovative off-road racing cars for any off-road enthusiast. The Company has not realized significant revenues to date and therefore is classified as a development stage company. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Basic (Loss) per Common Share Basic (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Companys net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Companys net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no such common stock equivalents outstanding as of September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006.

Comprehensive Income The Company has no component of other comprehensive income. Accordingly, net income equals comprehensive income for the period ended September 30, 2007. Advertising Costs The Companys policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company had not incurred any advertising expense as of September 30, 2007. F-8 50 KAT RACING, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AND 2006 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes. Income Taxes The Company provides for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 Requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. The Companys predecessor operated as entity exempt from Federal and State income taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to net loss before provision for income taxes for the following reasons: September 31, September 30, 2007 2006 Income tax expense at statutory rate $ 8,267 $ 5,507 Common stock issued for services -0- -0- Valuation allowance (8,267) (5,507) Income tax expense per books $ -0- $ -0- Net deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of: March 31, September 30, 2007 2006 NOL Carryover $ 13,774 $ 5,507 Valuation allowance (13,774) (5,507) Net deferred tax asset $ -0- $ -0- Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years. F-9 51 KAT RACING, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AND 2006 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. Accounting Basis The basis is accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company has adopted a September 30 fiscal year end. Inventory The Company accounts for inventory on the cost basis. Work in progress includes labor and over charges. The inventory is maintained on a first in- first out (FIFO) basis. The Companys inventory as of September 30, 2007 and 2006 was comprised of the following: Raw Materials $ 76,920 $ 45,520 Work in Progress -0- -0- Supplies -0- -0- Finished Goods -0- -0- Total $ 76,920 $ 45,520 Stock-based compensation. As of September 30, 2007, the Company has not issued any share-based payments to its employees. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123-R effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. Under this transition method, stock compensation expense includes compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted on or after January 1,2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123-R. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Where applicable, SFAS No. 157 simplifies and codifies related guidance within GAAP and does not require any new fair value measurements. F-10 52 KAT RACING, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AND 2006 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements (Continued) SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is encouraged. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a significant effect on its financial position or results of operation. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on its financial reporting, and the Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of FIN 48 will have on its disclosure requirements. In March 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. This statement requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in any of the following situations: a transfer of the servicers financial assets that meets the requirements for sale accounting; a transfer of the servicers financial assets to a qualifying special-purpose entity in a guaranteed mortgage securitization in which the transferor retains all of the resulting securities and classifies them as either available-for-sale securities or trading securities; or an acquisition or assumption of an obligation to service a financial asset that does not relate to financial assets of the servicer or its consolidated affiliates. The statement also requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value, if practicable, and permits an entity to choose either the amortization or fair value method for subsequent measurement of each class of servicing assets and liabilities. The statement further permits, at its initial adoption, a one-time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities by entities with recognized servicing rights, without calling into question the treatment of other available for sale securities under Statement 115, provided that the available for sale securities are identified in some manner as offsetting the entitys exposure to changes in fair value of servicing assets or servicing liabilities that a servicer elects to subsequently measure at fair value and requires separate presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value in the statement of financ ial position and additional disclosures for all separately recognized F-11 53 KAT RACING, INC.

This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year. Management believes the adoption of this statement will have no immediate impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. 2.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS Indemnification under Corporate Documents The Registrant's bylaws provide in part as follows: SECTION 1. INDEMNIFICATION GENERALLY. Every person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or a person of whom he is the legal representative is or was a director or officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of our company or for its benefit as a director or officer of another corporation, or as its representative in a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall be indemnified and held harmless to the fullest extent legally permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Nevada from time to time against all expenses, liability and loss (including moneys' fees. judgments, fines and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by him in connection therewith. The expenses of officers and directors incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding must be paid by the corporation as they are incurred and in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation. Such right of indemnification shall be a contract right which may be enforced in any manner desired by such person. Such right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other right which such directors, officers or representatives may have or hereafter acquire and, without limiting the generality of such statement, they shall be entitled to their respective rights of indemnification under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders, provision of law or otherwise, as well as their rights under this Article. Our board of directors may cause the corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a direc tor or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, or as its representative in a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred in any such capacity or arising out of such status, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person. Our board of directors may from time to time adopt further Bylaws with respect to indemnification and may amend these and such Bylaws to provide at all times the fullest indemnification permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Nevada. SECTION 2. INDEMNIFICATION IN ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES. Subject to the limitations of law, if any, the corporation shall indemnify any director, officer, employee and agent of the corporation who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of to procure a judgment in its favor) against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such proceeding. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere shall not, of itself create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation or that such person had reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful. SECTION 3. INDEMNIFICATION IN ACTIONS BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE CORPORATION. Subject to the limitations of law, if any, the Corporation shall indemnify any director, officer, employee and agent of the corporation who was or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed legal action by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, against expenses actually and reasonable incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement. No director or officer of our company shall be personally liable to our company or to any of its stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer involving any act or commission of any such director or officer provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director or officer for acts of omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law, or the payment of dividends in violation of Section 78.300 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. Any repeal or modification of this Article by the stockholders shall be prospective only, and shall not adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director or officer of our company for acts or omissions prior to such repeal or modification. 60 SECTION 4. ADVANCE OF EXPENSES. Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be advanced by the Corporation prior to the final disposition of such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the officer, director, employee or agent to repay such amount unless it shall be determined ultimately that the officer or director is entitled to be indemnified as authorized by this Article. SECTION 5. INSURANCE. The corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or agent of the Corporation against any liability asserted against or incurred by the officer, director, employee or agent in such capacity or arising out of such person's status as such whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the officer, or director, employee or agent against such liability under the provisions of this Article. Indemnification under Nevada Law We are a Nevada corporation and certain provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes provide for indemnification of our officers and directors against liabilities which they may incur in such capacities. A summary of the circumstances in which indemnification is provided is discussed below, but this description is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Articles of Incorporation, bylaws and to the actual statutory provisions. Section 78.7502(1) of the Nevada Revised Statutes authorizes a Nevada corporation to indemnify any director, officer, employee, or corporate agent "who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, except an action by or in the right of the corporation" due to his or her corporate role. Section 78.7502(1) extends this protection "against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such director, officer, employee or corporate agent in connection with the action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful." Section 78.7502(2) of the Nevada Revised Statutes also authorizes indemnification of the reasonable defense or settlement expenses of a corporate director, officer, employee or agent who is sued, or is threatened with a suit, by or in the right of the corporation. The party must have been acting in good faith and with the reasonable belief that his or her actions were in or not opposed to the corporation's best interests. Unless the court rules that the party is reasonably entitled to indemnification, the party seeking indemnification must not have been found liable to the corporation. To the extent that a corporate director, officer, employee, or agent is successful on the merits or otherwise in defending any action or proceeding referred to in Section 78.7502(1) or 78.7502(2), Section 78.7502(3) of the Nevada Revised Statutes requires that he be indemnified "against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense." Unless ordered by a court or advanced pursuant to Section 78.751(2), Section 78.751(1) of the Nevada Revised Statutes limits indemnification under Section 78.7502 to situations in which either (1) the stockholders, (2) the majority of a disinterested quorum of directors, or (3) independent legal counsel determine that indemnification is proper under the circumstances. Section 78.751(2) authorizes a corporation's articles of incorporation, bylaws or agreement to provide that directors' and officers' expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action must be paid by the corporation as incurred, rather than upon final disposition of the action, upon receipt by the director or officer to repay the amount if a court ultimately determines that he is not entitled of an undertaking to indemnification. Section 78.751(3)(a) provides, subject to certain exceptions, that the rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights under the articles of association, any bylaw, agreement, stockholder vote or vote of disinterested directors. Section 78.751(3)(b) extends the rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses to former directors, officers, employees and agents, as well as their heirs, executors, and administrators. 61 Regardless of whether a director, officer, employee or agent has the right to indemnity, Section 78.752 allows the corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on his behalf against liability resulting from his or her corporate role. OTHER EXPENSES OF ISSUANCE AND DISTRIBUTION SEC Registration Fee $ 300 EDGAR Conversion Fees $ 500 Blue Sky Qualification Fees and Expenses $ 2,000 Accounting Fees and Expenses $ 1,000 Legal Fees and Expenses $ 1,000 Printing Fees $ 1,000 Miscellaneous $ 1,000 Total $ 6,800 RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES On December 27, 2005, the Company received $15,000 from its founders for 4,000,000 shares of its common stock. On December 27, 2005, the Company received $700 for 700,000 shares of its common stock. At the time of the issuance, the founders had fair access to and were in possession of all available material information about our company, as the sole officers and directors of KAT. The shares bear a restrictive transfer legend in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act. On the basis of these facts, we claim that the issuance of stock to our founding shareholder qualifies for the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. On August 13, 2006, the Company completed an unregistered private offering under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, relying upon the exemption from registration afforded by Rule 504 of Regulation D promulgated there under. The Company sold 1,049,000 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock at a price of $0.05 per share for $51,450 in cash.The shares bear a restrictive transfer legend. This transaction (a) involved no general solicitation, (b) involved less than thirty-five non-accredited purchasers, and (c) relied on a detailed disclosure document to communicate to the investors all material facts about KAT Racing, including an audited balance sheet and reviewed statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows. Each purchaser was given the opportunity to ask questions of us. Thus, we believe that the offering was exempt from registration under Regulation D, Rule 505 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. EXHIBITS Exhibit Number Name and/or Identification of Exhibit 3. Articles of Incorporation & By-Laws a) Articles of Incorporation filed on December 5, 2005 * b) Bylaws adopted on September 27, 2004 * 5. Opinion on Legality Attorney Opinion Letter 23. Consent of Experts and Counsel a) Consent of Counsel b) Consent of Independent Auditor 99 Additional Exhibits(a) Escrow Agreement(b) Subscription Agreement 62 UNDERTAKINGS The registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which it offers or sells securities, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement to: (i) Include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"); (ii) Reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information in the registration statement; Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee&quo t; table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) Include any additional or changed material information on the plan of distribution. (2) For determining liability under the Act, to treat each post-effective amendment as a new registration statement of the securities offered, and the offering of the securities at that time to be the initial bona fide offering. (3) To file a post-effective amendment to remove from registration any of the securities which remain unsold at the end of the offering. (4) For determining liability under the Act, to any purchaser in the initial distribution of securities, the undersigned small business issuer undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned small business issuer pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned small business issuer will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned small business issuer relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (230.424 of this chapter); (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned small business issuer or used or referred to by the undersigned small business issuer; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned small business issuer or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned small business issuer; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned small business issuer to the purchaser. (5) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the small business issuer pursuant to the foreg oing provisions, or otherwise, the small business issuer has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the small business issuer of expenses incurred or paid by a Director, officer or controlling person of the small business issuer in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the small business issuer will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. (6) For the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as a part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.
