We intend to be in the business of mineral property exploration. To date, we have not conducted any exploration on our sole exploration target, the Monkey claim, which is located in the Alberni Mining Division of British Columbia, Canada. We acquired the property from 1330275 Ontario Ltd. for CDN$6,000. Our objective is to conduct mineral exploration activities on the Monkey claim in order to assess whether it possesses economic reserves of copper, zinc and silver. We have not yet identified any economic mineralization on the Monkey claim. Our proposed exploration program is designed to search for an economic mineral deposit. We were incorporated on January 10, 2007, under the laws of the state of Nevada. Our principal offices are located at #2-1839 West 5 th Ave., Vancouver, British Columbia Canada V6J 1P5. Our telephone number is (604) 730-2782. The Offering : Securities Being Offered Up to 2,125,000 shares of common stock. Offering Price The selling shareholders will sell their shares at $0.02 per share until our shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. We cannot ensure that our shares will be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. We determined this offering price based upon the price of the last sale of our common stock to investors. Terms of the Offering The selling shareholders will determine when and how they will sell the common stock offered in this prospectus. Termination of the Offering The offering will conclude when all of the 2,125,000 shares of common stock have been sold, the shares no longer need to be registered to be sold or we decide to terminate the registration of the shares. Securities Issued and to be Issued 6,625,000 shares of our common stock are issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus. All of the common stock to be sold under this prospectus will be sold by existing shareholders. Use of Proceeds We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock by the selling shareholders. Summary Financial Information Balance Sheet May 31, 2007 (audited) February 29, 2008 (unaudited) Cash $22,329 $10,665 Total Assets $27,458 $21,891 Liabilities $ 3,000 $ 3,000 Total Stockholders Equity $24,458 $18,891 Statement of Operations From Incorporation on January 10, 2007 to February 29, 2008 (unaudited) Revenue $0 Net Loss and Deficit ($9,109) Risk Factors An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The following is a discussion of all of the material risks relating to the offering and our business. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. If we do not obtain additional financing, our business will fail. Our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete all intended exploration of the Monkey claim, and therefore we will need to obtain additional financing in order to complete our business plan. We currently do not have any operations and we have no income. As well, we will not receive any funds from this registration. Our business plan calls for significant expenses in connection with the exploration of the Monkey claim. While we have sufficient funds to conduct initial exploration on the claim, we will need additional funds to complete any additional recommended exploration. Even after completing initial exploration, we will not know if we have a commercially viable mineral deposit. We will require additional financing to sustain our business operations if we are not successful in earning revenues once exploration is complete. We do not currently have any arrangements for financing and may not be able to find such financing if required. Because we have not commenced business operations, we face a high risk of business failure. We have not yet commenced exploration on the Monkey claim. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. We were incorporated on January 10, 2007 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities and the acquisition of an interest in the Monkey claim. We have not earned any revenues as of the date of this prospectus. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new mineral exploration companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the exploration of the mineral properties that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to exploration, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. Prior to completion of our exploration stage, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We therefore expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if we are unable to generate significant revenues from development of the Monkey claim and the production of minerals from the claim, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail. Because of the speculative nature of exploration of mining properties, there is a substantial risk that our business will fail. The search for valuable minerals as a business is extremely risky. The likelihood of our mineral claim containing economic mineralization or reserves of gold is extremely remote. Exploration for minerals is a speculative venture necessarily involving substantial risk. In all probability, the Monkey claim does not contain any reserves and funds that we spend on exploration will be lost. As well, problems such as unusual or unexpected formations and other conditions are involved in mineral exploration and often result in unsuccessful exploration efforts. In such a case, we would be unable to complete our business plan. Because our continuation as a going concern is in doubt, we will be forced to cease business operations unless we can generate profit in the future. The report of our independent accountant to our audited financial statements for the period ended May 31, 2007 indicates that there are a number of factors that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Such factors identified in the report are that we have no source of revenue and our dependence upon obtaining adequate financing. If we are not able to continue as a going concern, it is likely investors will lose all of their investment. Because of the inherent dangers involved in mineral exploration, there is a risk that we may incur liability or damages, which could hurt our financial position and possibly result in the failure of our business. The search for valuable minerals involves numerous hazards. As a result, we may become subject to liability for such hazards, including pollution, cave-ins and other hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. The payment of such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Even if we discover commercial reserves of precious metals on the Monkey claim, we may not be able to successfully commence commercial production. The Monkey claim does not contain any known bodies of mineralization. If our exploration programs are successful in establishing quartz diorite and gold of commercial tonnage and grade, we will require additional funds in order to place the Monkey claim into commercial production. We may not be able to obtain such financing. Because our sole director and officer has other business interests, he may not be able or willing to devote a sufficient amount of time to our business operations, causing our business to fail. Our president, Mr. Tyrone McClay, intends to devote approximately 35% of his business time providing his services to us. While he presently possesses adequate time to attend to our interests, it is possible that the demands on Mr. McClay from his other obligations could increase with the result that he would no longer be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business. Because our director has no technical experience in mineral exploration, our business has a higher risk of failure. Our sole director and officer does not have any technical training in the field of geology. As a result, we may not be able to recognize and take advantage of potential acquisition and exploration opportunities in the sector without the aid of qualified geological consultants. As well, with no direct training or experience, Mr. McClay may not be fully aware of the specific requirements related to working in this industry. His decisions and choices may not be well thought out and our operations and ultimate financial success may suffer irreparable harm as a result. If a market for our common stock does not develop, shareholders may be unable to sell their shares and will incur losses as a result. There is currently no market for our common stock and no certainty that a market will develop. We currently plan to apply for listing of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board upon the effectiveness of the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part. Our shares may never trade on the OTC Bulletin Board. If no market is ever developed for our shares, it will be difficult for shareholders to sell their stock. In such a case, shareholders may find that they are unable to achieve benefits from their investment. A purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits his or her ability to sell the stock. The shares offered by this prospectus constitute penny stock under the Exchange Act. The shares will remain penny stock for the foreseeable future. The classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a broker-dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, thus limiting investment liquidity. Any broker-dealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares in our company will be subject to rules 15g-1 through 15g-10 of the Exchange Act. Rather than creating a need to comply with those rules, some broker-dealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock. Forward-Looking Statements This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. You should not place too much reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus. Use Of Proceeds We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered through this prospectus by the selling shareholders. Determination Of Offering Price The selling shareholders will sell our shares at $0.02 per share until our shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. We cannot ensure that our shares will be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. We determined this offering price, based upon the price of the last sale of our common stock to investors. Dilution The common stock to be sold by the selling shareholders is common stock that is currently issued and outstanding. Accordingly, there will be no dilution to our existing shareholders. Selling Security Holders The selling shareholders named in this prospectus are offering all of the 2,125,000 shares of common stock offered through this prospectus. These shares were acquired from us in private placements that were exempt from registration under Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933.

The numbers in this table assume that none of the selling shareholders sells shares of common stock not being offered in this prospectus or purchases additional shares of common stock, and assumes that all shares offered are sold. The percentages are based on 2,125,000 shares of common stock outstanding on the date of this prospectus. None of the selling shareholders: (1) has had a material relationship with us other than as a shareholder at any time within the past three years; (2) has ever been one of our officers or directors; or (3) is a broker-dealer or affiliate of a broker dealer. Plan Of Distribution The selling shareholders may sell some or all of their common stock in one or more transactions, including block transactions. Such sales may occur in private transactions arranged by each selling shareholder in accordance with resale exemptions in applicable jurisdictions or through the facilities of the OTC Bulletin Board, if we successfully obtain a quotation for our stock, of which there is no guarantee. The selling shareholders will sell our shares at $0.02 per share until our shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. We cannot ensure that our shares will be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. We determined this offering price based upon the price of the last sale of our common stock to investors. This offering price has no relationship to book value. The shares may also be sold in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 144. We are bearing all costs relating to the registration of the common stock. The selling shareholders, however, will pay any commissions or other fees payable to brokers or dealers in connection with any sale of the common stock. The selling shareholders must comply with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in the offer and sale of the common stock. In particular, during such times as the selling shareholders may be deemed to be engaged in a distribution of the common stock, and therefore be considered to be an underwriter, they must comply with applicable law and may, among other things: 1. Not engage in any stabilization activities in connection with our common stock; 2. Furnish each broker or dealer through which common stock may be offered, such copies of this prospectus, as amended from time to time, as may be required by such broker or dealer; and 3. Not bid for or purchase any of our securities or attempt to induce any person to purchase any of our securities other than as permitted under the Exchange Act. The Securities Exchange Commission has also adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, which: 1. contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; 2. contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties; 3. contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including "bid" and "ask" prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; 4. contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; 5. defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks; and 6. contains such other information and is in such form (including language, type, size, and format) as the Commission shall require by rule or regulation; The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to proceeding with any transaction in a penny stock, the customer: 1. with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; 2. details of the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; 3. the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and 4. monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities. Description of Securities General Our authorized capital stock consists of 75,000,000 shares of common stock at a par value of $0.001 per share. Common Stock As of June 13, 2008, there were 6,625,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding that are held by 31 stockholders of record. Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters submitted to a stockholder vote. Holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. Therefore, holders of a majority of the shares of common stock voting for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. Two shareholders that are present at a meeting, or persons representing by written proxy, are necessary to constitute a quorum at any meeting of our stockholders. A vote by the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares is required to effectuate certain fundamental corporate changes such as liquidation, merger or an amendment to our articles of incorporation. Holders of common stock are entitled to share in all dividends that the board of directors, in its discretion, declares from legally available funds. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each outstanding share entitles its holder to participate pro rata in all assets that remain after payment of liabilities and after providing for each class of stock, if any, having preference over the common stock. Holders of our common stock have no pre-emptive rights, no conversion rights and there are no redemption provisions applicable to our common stock. Preferred Stock We do not have an authorized class of preferred stock. Dividend Policy We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Share Purchase Warrants We have not issued and do not have outstanding any warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Options We have not issued and do not have outstanding any options to purchase shares of our common stock. Convertible Securities We have not issued and do not have outstanding any securities convertible into shares of our common stock or any rights convertible or exchangeable into shares of our common stock. Interests of Named Experts And Counsel No expert or counsel named in this prospectus as having prepared or certified any part of this prospectus or having given an opinion upon the validity of the securities being registered or upon other legal matters in connection with the registration or offering of the common stock was employed on a contingency basis, or had, or is to receive, in connection with the offering, a substantial interest, direct or indirect, in the registrant. Nor was any such person connected with the registrant as a promoter, managing or principal underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer, or employee. The financial statements included in this prospectus and the registration statement have been audited by De Joya Griffith & Company LLC, Certified Public Accountants & Consultants, to the extent and for the periods set forth in their report appearing elsewhere in this document and in the registration statement filed with the SEC, and are included in reliance upon such report given upon the authority of said firm as experts in auditing and accounting. Description of Business We intend to commence operations as an exploration stage company. We will be engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties with a view to exploiting any mineral deposits we discover. We own a 100% interest in one mineral claim known as the Monkey claim, which is located approximately 40 kilometers west of Campbell River, British Columbia, Canada. We purchased this claim from 1330275 Ontario Ltd. There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on the Monkey claim. We do not have any current plans to acquire interests in additional mineral properties, though we may consider such acquisitions in the future. Mineral property exploration is typically conducted in phases. Each subsequent phase of exploration work is recommended by a geologist based on the results from the most recent phase of exploration. We have not yet commenced the initial phase of exploration on the Monkey claim. Once we have completed each phase of exploration, we will make a decision as to whether or not we proceed with each successive phase based upon the analysis of the results of that program. Our director will make this decision based upon the recommendations of the independent geologist who oversees the program and records the results. Our plan of operation is to conduct exploration work on the Monkey claim in order to ascertain whether it possesses economic quantities of gold. There can be no assurance that an economic mineral deposit exists on the Monkey claim until appropriate exploration work is completed. Even if we complete our proposed exploration programs on the Monkey claim and we are successful in identifying a mineral deposit, we will have to spend substantial funds on further drilling and engineering studies before we will know if we have a commercially viable mineral deposit. Monkey claim Purchase On February 26, 2007, we entered into a Mineral Property Staking and Purchase Agreement with 1330275 Ontario Ltd. whereby we purchased a 100% interest in the Monkey claim for CDN$6,000. Description, Location and Access The Monkey claim is located approximately 40 kilometers west of Campbell River, in the Nanaimo Mining Division of British Columbia. The claim is accessed by way of highway 28 from Campbell River and then by well-maintained gravel logging roads. The property is accessible by two-wheel drive automobile in dry weather conditions. Otherwise, a four-wheel drive vehicle is recommended. Title to the Monkey claim The Monkey claim consists of one mineral claim comprising 124.6 hectares. A mineral claim refers to a specific section of land over which a title holder owns rights to explore the ground and subsurface, and extract minerals. Claims details are as follows: Claim Name Record Number Expiry Date Monkey Claim 559418 May 29, 2009 Geological Setting and Mineralization In this section, the following geological terms have the indicated meaning: Basaltic: relating to basalt, a fine grained gray to black volcanic rock Chalcopyrite: a copper-iron sulphide mineral; the major ore mineral of copper Diorite: a medium-gray volcanic rock, often with a salt and pepper appearance Felsic: relating to volcanic rock that has abundant light-colored minerals and is rich in silica Gabbro: a dark, coarse grained volcanic rock that contains iron and magnesium Pyrite: an iron sulphide mineral, also known as fools gold Shear: the deformation of rocks by lateral movement along innumerable parallel planes, generally resulting from pressure Sill: a tabular volcanic rock that parallels the structure of adjacent rocks Sphalerite: a zinc sulphide mineral; the primary ore of zinc Tuff: a geological formation composed of compressed volcanic ash The geology of the Monkey claim indicates the presence of a coarse grained, magnetic diorite/gabbro sill intruding basaltic flows. Narrow (up to one meter wide) discontinuous inter-beds of finely banded felsic tuff are exposed throughout the area. The main showing on the claim consists of a 50 meter long by 15 meter wide exposure on the south side of a logging road. The mineralization consists of polymetallic pyrite, sphalerite and chalcopyrite in a one meter wide shear structure occurring within a six meter wide rusty orange zone. Exploration History The Monkey property was first explored in 1987 after logging road construction exposed sulphide bearing mineralization. In April 1988, two one-day Traverses of the claim were conducted to outline the extent of the mineral showing on the property and to locate any additional exposures. A total of ten rock samples were collected and analyzed. In July 1989, a four day exploration program was undertaken consisting of laying out 1.7 line kilometers of grid, followed by geological mapping, VLF/EM (very low frequency/electromagnetic) and magnetometer surveys. A VLF survey uses radio waves to determine whether rocks on a mineral property conduct electricity. The metals that we seek are above average conductors of electricity and will affect VLF readings. Electromagnetic and magnetometer surveys involve measuring the strength of the earths magnetic field. Variations in the magnetic readings on a property may indicate the increased likelihood of minerals in the area. Geological Report We have obtained a geological report on the Monkey claim that was prepared by Shaun M Dykes. Shaun M Dykes obtained a degree of Bachelor of Science (engineering) in Geology from Queens University in 1976. The geological report summarizes details concerning the Monkey claim and makes a recommendation for further exploration work. Based on his review of geological information relating to the Monkey claim, Mr. Dykes recommends an initial exploration program on the property consisting of soil geochemical sampling and geologic mapping. Geochemical sampling consists of a consulting geologist and his assistant gathering chip samples and grab samples from property areas with the most potential to host economically significant mineralization based on past exploration results. Grab samples are soil samples or pieces of rock that appear to contain minerals. All samples gathered will be sent to a laboratory where they are crushed and analysed for metal content. Mapping involves plotting previous exploration data relating to a property on a map in order to determine the best property locations to conduct subsequent exploration work. Mr. Dykes has provided us with the following estimate of the costs of the initial exploration program: Geologist (14 days @ $600/day) $ 8,400 Sampler (14 days @ $300/day) $ 4,200 Accommodation and travel $ 4,200 Sample Analysis (120 soil samples, 30 rock samples) $ 9,000 Truck rental and fuel $ 1,750 Geology report $ 800 Contingencies (20%) $ 5,670 TOTAL: $ 34,020 Compliance with Government Regulation We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in Canada generally, and in British Columbia specifically. We will have to sustain the cost of reclamation and environmental mediation for all exploration and development work undertaken. The amount of these costs is not known at this time as we do not know the extent of the exploration program that will be undertaken beyond completion of the currently planned work programs. Because there is presently no information on the size, tenor, or quality of any resource or reserve at this time, it is impossible to assess the impact of any capital expenditures on earnings or our competitive position in the event a potentially economic deposit is discovered. If we enter into production, the cost of complying with permit and regulatory environment laws will be greater than in the exploration phases because the impact on the project area is greater. Permits and regulations will control all aspects of any production program if the project continues to that stage because of the potential impact on the environment. Examples of regulatory requirements include: - Water discharge will have to meet water standards; - Dust generation will have to be minimal or otherwise re-mediated; - Dumping of material on the surface will have to be re-contoured and re-vegetated; - An assessment of all material to be left on the surface will need to be environmentally benign; - Ground water will have to be monitored for any potential contaminants; - The socio-economic impact of the project will have to be evaluated and if deemed negative, will have to be re-mediated; and - There will have to be an impact report of the work on the local fauna and flora. Because there will not be any appreciable disturbance to the land during the phase one and two exploration programs on the Monkey claim, we will not have to seek any government approvals prior to conducting exploration.

(An Exploration Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements (Expressed in U.S. Dollars) Note 1: Business and History The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 10, 2007. The Company is an Exploration Stage Company as defined by Guide 7 of the Securities Exchange Commissions Industry Guide. The Company has acquired a mineral property located in the Province of British Columbia, Canada and has not yet determined whether this property contains reserves that are economically recoverable. The recoverability of property expenditures will be dependent upon the discovery of economically recoverable reserves, confirmation of the Companys interest in the underlying property, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to satisfy the expenditure requirements under the property agreement and upon future profitable production or proceeds for the sale thereof. The Company is devoting all of its present efforts to securing and establishing a new business and its planned principle operations have not commenced. Accordingly, no revenue has been derived during the organization period. In response to these problems, management has planned the following actions: · The Company intends to apply for an S-1 Registration Statement. · Management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies The following is a summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these financial statements. Basis of presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to exploration stage enterprises, and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Companys fiscal year end is May 31. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Mineral property costs The Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation on January 10, 2007 and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations. It is primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mining properties. In accordance with SFAS 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies, costs incurred to purchase or acquire a property (whether proved or unproved reserves) shall be capitalized when incurred. This includes acquisitions costs associated with mineral claims. Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserve. Stealth Resources Inc. (An Exploration Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements (Expressed in U.S. Dollars) Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies  (continued) Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, according to the usual industry standards for the stage of exploration of such properties, these procedures do not guarantee the Companys title. Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers and title may be affected by undetected defects. Financial instruments The carrying value of cash and accrued liabilities approximates their fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Companys operations are in Canada and virtually all of its assets and liabilities are giving rise to significant exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency rates. The Companys financial risk is the risk that arises from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility of these rates. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk. Environmental expenditures The operations of the Company have been, and may in the future, be affected from time to time, in varying degrees, by changes in environmental regulations, including those for future reclamation and site restoration costs. Both the likelihood of new regulations and their overall effect upon the Company vary greatly and are not predictable. The Companys policy is to meet or, if possible, surpass standards set by relevant legislation, by application of technically proven and economically feasible measures. Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing environmental and reclamation programs are charged against earnings as incurred or capitalized and amortized depending on their future economic benefits. Estimated future reclamation and site restoration costs, when the ultimate liability is reasonably determinable, are charged against earnings over the estimated remaining life of the related business operation, net of expected recoveries. Income taxes Deferred income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes , which requires the use of the asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax loss and credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company provides for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards when realization is more likely than not. Basic and diluted net loss per share The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128,  Earnings per Share . SFAS No. 128 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Stealth Resources Inc. (An Exploration Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements (Expressed in U.S. Dollars) Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies  (continued) In computing Diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. Foreign currency translation The Companys functional and reporting currency is in U.S. dollars. The financial statements of the Company are translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation . Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income. The Company has not, to the date of these financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Concentrations of credit risk The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and related party payables. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times, its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Companys management also routinely assesses the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited. Risks and uncertainties The Company operates in the resource exploration industry that is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including financial, operational, technological, and other risks associated with operating a resource exploration business, including the potential risk of business failure. Note 3: Recent accounting pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes--an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken on a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes. We are currently evaluating the requirements of FIN 48 and the impact this interpretation may have on our financial statements. Stealth Resources Inc. (An Exploration Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements (Expressed in U.S. Dollars) Note 3: Recent accounting pronouncements  (continued) In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 which applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, except not-for-profit organizations, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. The statement is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2008. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, (SFAS 161) as amended and interpreted, which requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities and thereby improves the transparency of financial reporting. Disclosing the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format provides a more complete picture of the location in an entitys financial statements of both the derivative positions existing at period end and the effect of using derivatives during the reporting period. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interp retations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. Note 4: Mineral Property Pursuant to a mineral property purchase agreement dated February 26, 2007, the Company acquired a 100% undivided right, title and interest in a mineral claim, located in the Alberni Mining Division of British Columbia, Canada for a cash payment of $5,129 and delivery of a geological report. The Company intends to maintain the claim in good standing and contract a independent geologist to provide a report should the seller fail to provide one. Mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Note 5: Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are non-interest bearing, unsecured and have settlement dates within one year. Note 6: Common Stock a. Authorized - The total authorized capital is 75,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001. b. Issued and outstanding - The total issued and outstanding capital stock is Nil. On February 8, 2007, 4,500,000 common shares of the Company were subscribed for cash proceeds of $4,500. On February 21, 2007, 1,250,000 common shares of the Company were subscribed for cash proceeds of $5,000. On March 19, 2007, 875,000 common shares of the Company were subscribed for cash proceeds of $17,500. Stealth Resources Inc. (An Exploration Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements (Expressed in U.S. Dollars) Note 6: Common Stock  (continued) As of March 19, 2007, the Company received $27,000 for 6,625,000 shares of common stock. At May 31, 2007, there were no outstanding stock options or warrants. Note 7: Income Taxes The Company has losses carried forward for income tax purposes to May 31, 2007. There are no current or deferred tax expenses for the period ended May 31, 2007 due to the Companys loss position. The Company has fully reserved for any benefits of these losses. The deferred tax consequences of temporary differences in reporting items for financial statement and income tax purposes are recognized, as appropriate. Realization of the future tax benefits related to the deferred tax assets is dependent on many factors, including the Companys ability to generate taxable income within the net operating loss carryforward period. Management has considered these factors in reaching its conclusion as to the valuation allowance for financial reporting purposes. The provision for refundable federal income tax consists of the following: For the period from the date of Inception (January 10, 2007) to May 31, 2007 Deferred tax asset attributable to: Current operations $ (1,204) Less: Change in valuation allowance 1,204 Net refundable amount $ -- Note 7: Income Taxes  (continued) The composition of the Companys deferred tax assets as at May 31, 2007 is as follows: Stealth Resources Inc. (An Exploration Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements (Expressed in U.S. Dollars) For the period from the date of Inception (January 10, 2007) to May 31, 2007 Net operating loss carryforward $ (3,542) Statutory federal income tax rate 34% Effective income tax rate 0% Deferred tax asset $ (1,204) Less: Valuation allowance 1,204 Net deferred tax asset $ -- The potential income tax benefit of these losses has been offset by a full valuation allowance. As at May 31, 2007, the Company has an unused net operating loss carry-forward balance of approximately $3,542 that is available to offset future taxable income. This unused net operating loss carry-forward balance expires in 2027. Stealth Resources Inc.

(An Exploration Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements (Expressed in U.S. Dollars) Note 1: Business and History The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 10, 2007. The Company is an exploration Stage Company as defined by Guide 7 of the Securities Exchange Commissions Industry Guide. The Company has acquired a mineral property located in the Province of British Columbia, Canada and has not yet determined whether this property contains reserves that are economically recoverable. The recoverability of property expenditures will be dependent upon the discovery of economically recoverable reserves, confirmation of the Companys interest in the underlying property, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to satisfy the expenditure requirements under the property agreement and upon future profitable production or proceeds for the sale thereof. The Company is devoting all of its present efforts to securing and establishing a new business and its planned principle operations have not commenced. Accordingly, no revenue has been derived during the organization period. In response to these problems, management has planned the following actions: · The Company intends to apply for an S-1 Registration Statement. · Management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the nine months ended February 29, 2008 and for all periods presented have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States have been condensed or omitted for purposes of filing interim financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The condensed financial statements included in this report should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Companys audited financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2007. The results of operations for the nine months ended February 29, 2008 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies The following is a summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these financial statements. Basis of presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to exploration stage enterprises, and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Companys fiscal year end is May 31. Stealth Resources Inc. (An Exploration Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements (Expressed in U.S. Dollars) Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies  (continued) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Mineral property costs The Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation on January 10, 2007 and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations. It is primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mining properties. In accordance with EITF 04-2, Whether Mineral Rights Are Tangible or Intangible Assets and SFAS 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies, costs incurred to purchase or acquire a property (whether proved or unproved reserves) shall be capitalized when incurred. This includes acquisitions costs associated with mineral claims. Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserve. Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, according to the usual industry standards for the stage of exploration of such properties, these procedures do not guarantee the Companys title. Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers and title may be affected by undetected defects. Financial instruments The carrying value of cash and accrued liabilities approximates their fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Companys operations are in Canada and virtually all of its assets and liabilities are giving rise to significant exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency rates. The Companys financial risk is the risk that arises from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility of these rates. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk. Environmental expenditures The operations of the Company have been, and may in the future, be affected from time to time, in varying degrees, by changes in environmental regulations, including those for future reclamation and site restoration costs. Both the likelihood of new regulations and their overall effect upon the Company vary greatly and are not predictable. The Companys policy is to meet or, if possible, surpass standards set by relevant legislation, by application of technically proven and economically feasible measures. Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing environmental and reclamation programs are charged against earnings as incurred or capitalized and amortized depending on their future economic benefits. Estimated future reclamation and site restoration costs, when the ultimate liability is reasonably determinable, are charged against earnings over the estimated remaining life of the related business operation, net of expected recoveries. Stealth Resources Inc. (An Exploration Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements (Expressed in U.S. Dollars) Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies  (continued) Income taxes Deferred income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes , which requires the use of the asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax loss and credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company provides for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards when realization is more likely than not. Basic and diluted net loss per share The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128,  Earnings per Share . SFAS No. 128 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. In computing Diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. Foreign currency translation The Companys functional and reporting currency is in U.S. dollars. The financial statements of the Company are translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation . Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income. The Company has not, to the date of these financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Stealth Resources Inc. (An Exploration Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements (Expressed in U.S. Dollars) Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies  (continued) Concentrations of credit risk The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and related party payables. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times, its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Companys management also routinely assesses the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited. Risks and uncertainties The Company operates in the resource exploration industry that is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including financial, operational, technological, and other risks associated with operating a resource exploration business, including the potential risk of business failure. Note 3: Recent accounting pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes--an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken on a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes. We are currently evaluating the requirements of FIN 48 and the impact this interpretation may have on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 which applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, except not-for-profit organizations, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. The statement is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2008. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, (SFAS 161) as amended and interpreted, which requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities and thereby improves the transparency of financial reporting. Disclosing the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format provides a more complete picture of the location in an entitys financial statements of both the derivative positions existing at period end and the effect of using derivatives during the reporting period. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. Stealth Resources Inc. (An Exploration Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements (Expressed in U.S. Dollars) Note 4: Mineral Property Pursuant to a mineral property purchase agreement dated February 26, 2007, the Company acquired a 100% undivided right, title and interest in a mineral claim, located in the Alberni Mining Division of British Columbia, Canada for a cash payment of $5,129 and delivery of a geological report. The Company has paid an additional $6,098 for a geological report. Mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Note 5: Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are non-interest bearing, unsecured and have settlement dates within one year. Note 6: Common Stock c. Authorized - The total authorized capital is 75,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001. d. Issued and outstanding - The total issued and outstanding capital stock is Nil. On February 8, 2007, 4,500,000 common shares of the Company were subscribed for cash proceeds of $4,500. On February 21, 2007, 1,250,000 common shares of the Company were subscribed for cash proceeds of $5,000. On March 19, 2007, 875,000 common shares of the Company were subscribed for cash proceeds of $17,500. At February 29, 2008, there were no outstanding stock options or warrants. Plan Of Operations Our plan of operation for the twelve months following the date of this prospectus is to complete the geologist recommended exploration work on the Monkey claim consisting of geochemical sampling and geologic mapping. We estimate that the cost of this program will be approximately $34,020. We commenced the initial phase of exploration in the spring of 2008 and anticipate that it will be completed by the fall of 2008, including the interpretation of all data collected. As well, we anticipate spending an additional $15,000 on administrative fees, including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and complying with reporting obligations. Total expenditures over the next 12 months are therefore expected to be approximately $50,000. While we have enough funds to cover the anticipated exploration expenses associated with the first phase of the exploration program, we will require additional funding in order to proceed with additional exploration on the Monkey claim and to cover administrative expenses. We anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock or from director loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing or loans. Results of Operations For The Period From Inception Through February 29, 2008 We have not earned any revenues from our incorporation on January 10, 2007 to February 29, 2008. We do not anticipate earning revenues unless we enter into commercial production on the Monkey claim, which is doubtful. We have not commenced the exploration stage of our business and can provide no assurance that we will discover economic mineralization on the Monkey claim, or if such minerals are discovered, that we will enter into commercial production. We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $9,109 for the period from our inception on January 10, 2007 to February 29, 2008. These operating expenses were comprised of legal and accounting fees of $7,500, general and administrative costs of $852 and a loss suffered on foreign currency exchange of $756. We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue exploration activities. For these reasons our auditors believe that there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.

Disclosure of Commission Position of Indemnification For Securities Act Liabilities Our directors and officers are indemnified as provided by the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws. These provisions provide that we shall indemnify a director or former director against all expenses incurred by him by reason of him acting in that position. The director may also cause us to indemnify an officer, employee or agent in the same fashion. We have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our legal counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit the question of whether such indemnification is against public policy to a court of appropriate jurisdiction. We will then be governed by the court's decision. Until ______________, all dealers that effect transactions in these securities whether or not participating in this offering, may be required to deliver a prospectus. This is in addition to the dealer's obligation to deliver a prospectus when acting as underwriters and with respect to their unsold allotments or subscriptions.

We are paying all expenses of the offering listed above. No portion of these expenses will be borne by the selling shareholders. The selling shareholders, however, will pay any other expenses incurred in selling their common stock, including any brokerage commissions or costs of sale. Indemnification of Directors And Officers Our officers and directors are indemnified as provided by the Nevada Revised Statutes (the NRS) and our bylaws. Under the NRS, director immunity from liability to a company or its shareholders for monetary liabilities applies automatically unless it is specifically limited by a company's articles of incorporation that is not the case with our articles of incorporation. Excepted from that immunity are: (1) a willful failure to deal fairly with the company or its shareholders in connection with a matter in which the director has a material conflict of interest; (2) a violation of criminal law (unless the director had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was lawful or no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful); (3) a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal profit; and (4) willful misconduct. Our bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by Nevada law; provided, however, that we may modify the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with our directors and officers; and, provided, further, that we shall not be required to indemnify any director or officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless: (1) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law; (2) the proceeding was authorized by our Board of Directors; (3) such indemnification is provided by us, in our sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested us under Nevada law; or (4) such indemnification is required to be made pursuant to the bylaws. Our bylaws provide that we will advance all expenses incurred to any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was our director or officer, or is or was serving at our request as a director or executive officer of another company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request. This advance of expenses is to be made upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said amounts should it be ultimately determined that the person was not entitled to be indemnified under our bylaws or otherwise. Our bylaws also provide that no advance shall be made by us to any officer in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly made: (a) by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the proceeding; or (b) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to our best interests.

To file, during any period in which it offers or sells securities, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement to: a. include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; b. reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in this registration statement; and notwithstanding the forgoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in the volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration Statement; and c. include any additional or changed material information on the plan of distribution. 2. That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered herein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. 3.
