PROSPECTUS SUMMARY Our Company The Company was formed on June 23, 2017 in the State of Nevada. The Company is a Shell Company as defined by as defined in Rule 405. As such no shares will be eligible to be sold or transferred under Rule 144 until in excess of 1 year from the filing of the equivalent of Form 10 information by the Company with the SEC. The selling shareholders in this offering are underwriters. Business Strategy Tenaya Group Inc. (the "Company") was formed in the State of Nevada on June 23, 2017. The Company plans to produce feature length documentaries, podcasts and documentary style television series for mainstream broadcasters and popular video on demand platforms, such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Warner Brothers and Comcast. Management of the Company intends to create sophisticated, yet organic product placement opportunities within the films and series the Company creates. The Company is currently developing several series and films within the popular crime genre as well as the self-sustaining technologies genre. Management believes that TV series and films, such as Dope Opera, Wolves of Weed El Americano, George Jung Pod Cast and series that explore alternative medicines in the sports world, are currently considered high in demand. Our long-term goal is to create partnerships with the brands the Company promotes and to eventually promote products in which the Company owns rights to intellectual properties. Our media presence includes the following outlets: Website: www.tenayagroupinc.com/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/tenayagroup/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tenayagroup/ YouTube: Tenaya Group Inc.

This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. As an emerging growth company the company is exempt from Section 14A and B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes.

The Company is a Shell Company as defined by as defined in Rule 405. As such no shares will be eligible to be sold or transferred under Rule 144 until in excess of 1 year from the filing of the equivalent of Form 10 information by the Company with the SEC. The Offering This prospectus covers up to 1,235,000 shares to be sold by our selling shareholders who will sell at a fixed price of $0.05 per share until the prices of our common stock are quoted on the OTC Pink and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices.

Risk Factors An investment in our common stock is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. See Risk Factors beginning on page 6. 2 Shares registered in this prospectus may not be sold until it is declared effective. The common shares offered under this prospectus may not be sold by the selling security holders, except in negotiated transactions with a broker-dealer or market maker as principal or agent, or in privately negotiated transactions not involving a broker or dealer. Information regarding the selling security holders, the common shares they are offering to sell under this prospectus and the times and manner in which they may offer and sell those shares is provided in the sections of this prospectus captioned "Selling Security Holders" and "Plan of Distribution." RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock is highly speculative, involves a high degree of risk, and should be made only by investors who can afford a complete loss. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with the other information in this prospectus, including our financial statements and the related notes, before you decide to buy our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the trading of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment therein. Risks Relating to the Early Stage of our Company We are at a very early operational stage and our success is subject to the substantial risks inherent in the establishment of a new business venture. The implementation of our business strategy is in a very early stage. Our business and operations should be considered to be in a very early stage and subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business venture. Accordingly, our intended business and operations may not prove to be successful in the near future, if at all. Any future success that we might enjoy will depend upon many factors, several of which may be beyond our control, or which cannot be predicted at this time, and which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, business prospects and operations and the value of an investment in our company. We have a limited operating history as an entertainment company in which to evaluate our business. We plan on being an entertainment based media company producing several series and films within the popular crime genre as well as self-sustaining technologies genre for mainstream broadcasters and popular video on demand platforms. However, we have been unable to implement much of this new business model because of financing and resource constraints and limitations. To date, we have no revenue and a very limited operating history as a Hollywood based Media Company upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Current and future assets, including scripts and other properties that may be obtained in the future, may not be suitable for development unless additional financing is secured. No assurances of any nature can be made to investors that we will be profitable or that it will remain in business. There can be no assurances that our management will be successful operating an entertainment company. We are a shell company which may limit the tradability of shares under Rule 144. The Company is a Shell Company as defined by Rule 405. As such no shares will be eligible to be sold or transferred under Rule 144 until in excess of 1 year from the filing of the equivalent of Form 10 information by the Company with the SEC. Rule 144 will not be available for resales of our securities until we cease to be a shell company. As a shell company we will not be eligible to use Form S-8 or Form S-3. We have suffered operating losses since inception and we may not be able to achieve profitability. We had an accumulated deficit of ($153,614) as of December 31, 2017 and we expect to continue to incur significant set up and marketing expenses in the foreseeable future related to the completion of development of our media company. As a result, we are sustaining substantial operating and net losses, and it is possible that we will never be able to sustain or develop the revenue levels necessary to attain profitability. 3 We may have difficulty raising additional capital, which could deprive us of necessary resources. In order to support the initiatives envisioned in our business plan, we will need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing, collaborative relationships or other arrangements. Our ability to raise additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control, including the state of capital markets, the market price of our common stock and the development or prospects for development of competitive technology by others. Because our common stock is not listed on a stock market, many investors may not be willing or allowed to purchase it or may demand steep discounts. Sufficient additional financing may not be available to us or may be available only on terms that would result in further dilution to the current owners of our common stock. We expect to raise additional capital during 2018 but we do not have any firm commitments for funding. If we are unsuccessful in raising additional capital, or the terms of raising such capital are unacceptable, we may have to modify our business plan and/or significantly curtail our planned activities and other operations. The Company does not have sufficient funds to meet its requirements for the next 12 months. The company does not currently have sufficient funds to meet its requirements for the next 12 months. The Company will be mainly in the set up and fund-raising mode for the next 12 months and thus needing funding will be gained through sales of equity, debt or related party loans. An investment in these securities involves an exceptionally high degree of risk and is extremely speculative in nature. Following are what we believe are material risks involved if you decide to purchase shares in this offering. There are substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern and if we are unable to continue our business, our shares may have little or no value. The companys ability to become a profitable operating company is dependent upon its ability to generate revenues and/or obtain financing adequate to fulfill its research and market introduction activities, and achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure has raised substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. We plan to attempt to raise additional equity capital by selling shares in this offering and, if necessary, through one or more private placement or public offerings. However, the doubts raised, relating to our ability to continue as a going concern, may make our shares an unattractive investment for potential investors. These factors, among others, may make it difficult to raise any additional capital. Risks Related to Our Business Our independent registered auditors report includes an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have no committed sources of debt or equity financing. Our independent registered auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their opinion on our financial statements as of current date, which state that this lack of resources causes substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. No assurances can be given that we will generate sufficient revenue or obtain necessary financing to continue as a going concern. We are completely dependent on the services of our founders, the loss of any of one or more of whose services may cause our business operations to cease, and we will need to engage and retain qualified employees and consultants to further implement our strategy. Our operations and business strategy are completely dependent upon the knowledge and business connections of Mr. Booth, our President, and Mr. Shefsky, our Secretary and Treasurer. If one or more should choose to leave us for any reason, or become ill and are unable to work for an extended period of time before we have hired additional personnel, our operations will likely fail. Even if we are able to find additional personnel, it is uncertain whether we could find someone who could develop our business along the lines described in this prospectus. We will fail without the services of each of our founders or an appropriate replacement(s). 4 We intend to acquire key-man life insurance on the lives of Messrs. Booth and Shefsky, naming us as the beneficiary when and if we obtain the resources to do so, and if they are insurable at the time of application. We have not yet procured such insurance, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such insurance in the future. Accordingly, it is important that we are able to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified and talented personnel and independent contractors. Because the entertainment industry is intensely competitive, and we lack the name recognition and resources of many of our competitors, we may never generate any revenues or become profitable. The entertainment industry is highly competitive. We believe that a motion pictures theatrical success is dependent upon general public acceptance, marketing technology, advertising and the quality of the production. Some of the production and distribution companies with which we will compete to varying extents are Jerry Bruckheimer Films, Miramax Films, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc., New Line Cinema, a subsidiary of Time Warner, Universal Studios, 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, a subsidiary of News Corp., Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, a collection of affiliated motion picture studios all subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company, Paramount Pictures Corporation, a subsidiary of Viacom, and Troma Entertainment, Inc. All of these competitors are significantly larger than we are, have a long-standing business relationship with customers, vendors and financial institutions, and have established staying power in the industry over the past 20 years. Our management believes that in recent years there has been an increase in competition in virtually all facets of the motion picture industry. With increased alternative distribution channels for many types of entertainment, the motion picture business competes more intensely than previously with all other types of entertainment activities, as well as television. While increased use of pay-per-view television, pay television channels, and home video products are potentially beneficial, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully penetrate these markets. Failure to penetrate these potential distribution channels would have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and ability to maintain operations. We may be unable to obtain or license entertainment media that will be popular in the marketplace. We will seek to obtain or license entertainment media developed by others. If we are unable to do so, or if the entertainment media that we do acquire or license is not well-received in the marketplace, our operations will fail. Piracy of the original motion pictures that we plan to produce or distribute may reduce our revenues and potential earnings. Based on our best knowledge, we believe that piracy losses in the motion picture industry have increased substantially over the past decade. In certain regions of the world, motion picture piracy has been a major issue for some time. With the proliferation of the DVD format around the globe, along with other digital recording and playback devices, losses from piracy have spread more rapidly in North America and Europe. Piracy of original motion pictures that we produce and/or distribute may adversely impact the gross receipts realized from these films, which could have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations or financial condition. Our Board of Directors, which includes Mr. Booth, will make all decisions concerning compensation of our executive officers for the foreseeable future. These decisions may not be in the best interests of other investors. They will make all decisions determining the amount and timing of compensation for the foreseeable future until, if ever, we establish a compensation committee of the board of directors. Their decisions about compensation may not be in the best interests of other shareholders. 5 Our internal controls may be inadequate, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; (iii) receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and/or directors of the Company; and (iv) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Our internal controls may become inadequate or ineffective if our operations grow, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public. Investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision. Our operating results could fluctuate significantly from period to period. Like participants in the entertainment industry, our revenues and results of operations will be significantly dependent upon the timing of releases and the commercial success of the motion pictures and other media that we distribute, none of which can be predicted with certainty. In addition, we will only be able to issue a very limited number of films or other media in any individual accounting period. The level of market acceptance for each release is likely to vary, and may vary greatly. Accordingly, our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results for any future periods. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and industry practice, we intend to amortize film costs using the individual-film-forecast method under which such costs are amortized for each film in the ratio that revenue earned in the current period for such title bears to management's estimate of the total revenues to be realized from all media and markets for such title. To comply with this accounting principle, our management plans to regularly review, and revise when necessary, our total revenue estimates on a title-by-title basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the film asset to net realizable value. Results of operations in future years should be dependent upon our amortization of film costs and may be significantly affected by periodic adjustments in amortization rates. The likelihood of the Company's reporting of losses is increased because the industry's accounting method requires the immediate recognition of the entire loss in instances where it is expected that a motion picture should not recover the Company's investment. Similarly, should any of our films be profitable in a given period, we will recognize that profit over the entire revenue stream expected to be generated by the individual film. Film and entertainment production budgets may and often do increase and film production spending may exceed such budgets. It is common for future film and entertainment budgets to increase as the production process is underway for a variety of factors including, but not limited to: (1) escalation in compensation rates of people required to work on the projects; (2) number of personnel required to work on the projects; (3) equipment needs; (4) the enhancement of existing or the development of new proprietary technology; and (5) the addition of facilities to accommodate the amended or unseen requirements of the project. Due to production exigencies, which are often difficult to predict, it is not uncommon for film production spending to exceed film production budgets, and our projects may not be completed within the budgeted amounts. In addition, when production of each film is completed, we may incur significant carrying costs associated with transitioning personnel on creative and development teams from one project to another. This situation becomes more severe if several projects are being undertaken at the same time or planned to be done contiguously. 6 Our limited resources may not permit us to meet unexpected costs during productions. If such cost excesses occur and we are unable to arrange for the necessary financial needs, our operations may cease. If we are alleged or accused of having infringed on the intellectual property or other rights of third parties, we could be subject to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights. Our business activities are and will be highly dependent upon intellectual property, a field that has encountered increasing litigation in recent years. If third parties allege that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights, privacy rights or publicity rights, or have defamed them, we could become a party to litigation. These claims and any resulting lawsuits could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights and/or restrict our ability to publish and distribute the infringing or defaming content. In addition, defending such cases involves significant levels of legal costs. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any such litigation. If we were to lose a litigation relating to intellectual property, we could be forced to pay monetary damages and to cease the sale of certain products or the use of certain technology. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect our business and may cause us to cease operations. There are significant potential conflicts of interest Our key personnel and directors have other investments and involvements in other entities and, accordingly, these individuals may have conflicts of interest in allocating time among various business activities. In the course of other business activities, certain key personnel may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us, as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. As such, there may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. We cannot provide assurances that our efforts to eliminate the potential impact of conflicts of interest will be effective. Nevada Law and Our Articles of Incorporation May Protect our Directors From Certain Types of Lawsuits. Nevada law provides that our officers and directors will not be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as officers and directors. Our Bylaws permit us broad indemnification powers to all persons against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law. The exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing stockholders from recovering damages against our officers and directors caused by their negligence, poor judgment or other circumstances. The indemnification provisions may require us to use our limited assets to defend our officers and directors against claims, including claims arising out of their negligence, poor judgment, or other circumstances. Risks Relating to our Stock The Offering price of $0.05 per share is arbitrary. The Offering price of $0.05 per share has been arbitrarily determined by our management and does not bear any relationship to the assets, net worth or projected earnings of the Company, or any other generally accepted criteria of value. We have no firm commitments to purchase any shares. We have no firm commitment for the purchase of any shares. Therefore there is no assurance that a trading market will develop or be sustained. The Company has not engaged a placement agent or broker for the sale of the shares. The Company may be unable to identify investors to purchase the shares and may have inadequate capital to support its ongoing business obligations. 7 Our shares are not currently traded on any market or exchange. We will apply to have our common stock traded over the counter; there is no guarantee that our shares will ever be quoted on the OTC Markets Pink or listed on an exchange, which could severely impact their liquidity. Currently our shares are not traded on any market or exchange. We will apply to have our common stock quoted via the OTC Markets Pink. Therefore, our common stock is expected to have fewer market makers, lower trading volumes and larger spreads between bid and asked prices than securities listed on an exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market. These factors may result in higher price volatility and less market liquidity for the common stock. It is possible that the companys shares may never be quoted on the OTC Markets Pink or listed on an exchange. The Company intends to file a Form 8-A prior to the effectiveness of this registration to be fully reporting. A low market price would severely limit the potential market for our common stock. Our common stock is expected to trade at a price substantially below $5.00 per share, subjecting trading in the stock to certain SEC rules requiring additional disclosures by broker-dealers. These rules generally apply to any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price share of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions (a penny stock). Such rules require the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and institutional or wealthy investors. For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the sale. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to the broker-dealer, current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealers presumed control over the market. Such information must be provided to the customer orally or in writing before or with the written confirmation of trade sent to the customer. Monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock. FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock. In addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the SEC, which are discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor, FINRA rules require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker -dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative, low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market value for our shares. An investors ability to trade our common stock may be limited by trading volume. A consistently active trading market for our common stock may not occur on the OTC Markets Pink. A limited trading volume may prevent our shareholders from selling shares at such times or in such amounts as they may otherwise desire. The companys shares may never be quoted on the OTC Markets Pink or listed on an exchange. Our company has a concentration of stock ownership and control, which may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change of control. Our common stock ownership is highly concentrated. Through ownership of shares of our common stock, two shareholders, beneficially own 92.7% of our total outstanding shares of common stock before this offering. As a result of the concentrated ownership of the stock, this stockholder, acting alone, will be able to control all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company. It could also deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and it may affect the market price of our common stock. 8 We have not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of which, shareholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters. Recent federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements; others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges and NASDAQ, are those that address the board of Directors independence, audit committee oversight, and the adoption of a code of ethics. We have not yet adopted any of these corporate governance measures, and since our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ, we are not required to do so. It is possible that if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, shareholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. For example, in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees, may be made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions. Because we will not pay dividends in the foreseeable future, stockholders will only benefit from owning common stock if it appreciates. We have never paid dividends on our common stock and we do not intend to do so in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain any future earnings to finance our growth. Accordingly, any potential investor who anticipates the need for current dividends from his investment should not purchase our common stock.

We disclaim any obligation to update any such factors or to announce publicly the results of any revisions of the forward -looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments. For information regarding risk factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business, refer to the Risk Factors section of this prospectus beginning on page 6. Going Concern The future of our company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the sale of products and services through our websites. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement and public offering of its common stock, if necessary. Our auditors have expressed a going concern opinion because uncertainties raise doubts about the Issuers ability to continue as a going concern. Plan of Operation The company intends to apply to be listed on OTC Markets Pink and plans to raise additional capital. The Company Tenaya Group Inc. plans to produce feature length documentaries, podcasts and documentary style television series for mainstream broadcasters and popular video on demand platforms, such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Warner Brothers and Comcast. Management of the Company intends to create sophisticated, yet organic product placement opportunities within the films and series the Company creates. The activities of the Company has focused on: (i) creating, producing and distributing quality entertainment content across various media channels including feature film, television, radio, the Internet, as well as various forms of digital media for use in the home or on mobile devices; and (ii) utilizing direct response media marketing for the Companys film products. Direct response media and sales we believe will provide the Company with the potential of generating ongoing revenue on a consistent and relatively low risk basis. Our films, if and when started, will be feature length documentaries, podcasts and documentary style television series. To help undertake the Companys efforts in a potentially effective way, we may enter into joint ventures with other Hollywood producers, developers, marketers and distributors of film, video news releases, commercials, infomercials and sellers of consumer products through direct response marketing. The Company further intends to enter into contractual arrangements which may have the potential for developing or carrying out the Companys first few film projects, including production service agreements which will be important for providing facilities to engage the initial filming/production work for certain projects. Productions Recent advancements in video, internet, and mobile technologies have reduced the barriers to entry for video content creation and distribution. These changes in technology have meaningfully impacted consumer viewing habits. Traditional video content distribution channels, such as broadcast and cable television networks, are losing ground to alternative distribution platforms, including internet-delivered networks, such as social media, and OTT and DTC networks. This has fractionalized the viewing audience, making it more difficult for advertisers to reach their target audiences. 13 In addition, traditional cable subscriber fees and linear television advertising are coming under significant pressure as consumers migrate towards cord cutting, skinny bundles, OTT, and DTC offerings. As these trends continue, we anticipate that many industry participants will face constrained programming budgets and network failures. These trends are providing new opportunities not previously available with traditional linear broadcast and cable networks, both domestically and internationally. We believe that brands have become more important to attract viewers and sponsors and, accordingly, that an opportunity exists for companies that have access to sustainable brands. These companies can exploit their brands to break through the noise presented by the wide array of consumer viewing choices in order to provide video content that is readily identifiable to, and desired by, consumers. Companies such as Hallmark (family), Disney (family) and National Geographic (nature) have been able to use their brands to present programming targeted at specific areas of interest and attract viewers seeking such programming. The Company intends to commence production of documentary and/or feature films, which will involve locating a film production company and a studio that is well packaged, creating and writing good scripts, locating and engaging key actors and notable directors. Studios also often hire film production companies to produce films from their large inventories because they do not have the time and/or financial capability to undertake these projects due to emphasis being placed on larger mega productions. When the studio and the production company agree on a budget for the film, the production company keeps the difference between the budget and the actual cost of production, as well as a producers fee and a fixed percentage of the film's income from all distribution sources. The Company intends to produce quality films at or under budget, which we believe will stem from low overhead and strong relationships with industry suppliers. Management anticipates that the Company will not receive revenue from the studio until after the film is delivered and the producers fee paid over the course of production. A completion bond may be required or necessary. The Company cannot provide any assurances as to the likelihood of being able to obtain interim financing or a completion bond, if necessary. Production costs will be incurred principally with outside contractors working on writing, filming and editing of the Companys feature films and documentaries. Those efforts will be supervised and approved by our current management. The costs incurred for outside contractors will be paid entirely by us. The Company will market its films to distributors in domestic by utilizing its relationships with distributors for various markets as well as through industry shows and conferences. In the future, the Company may also consider distributing in international markets, which will be determined at a later date. However, no specific plans exist at this time and will not be undertaken unless and until we have the resources to do so. Marketing The Company plans on using direct response marketing to promote and sell its consumer entertainment products. Management believes that direct response marketing and a variety of other advertising channels will increase the Companys exposure among prospective customers. The direct response industry, consisting of direct response television and radio marketing, live home shopping channels, direct mail, catalogs, internet marketing and advertising, and outbound telemarketing, is one of the fastest growing segments of the filming and documentary retailing industry. The Companys planned use of direct response TV, if implemented, will allow customers the opportunity to purchase its entertainment films and products directly from the infomercial, thereby generating immediate sales and leads. Further, websites, email, and social media will be additional priorities in building the Companys future sales channels. The Company may also promote its products through the use of predominantly short and long form infomercials as the basis of its promotional strategy. We believe that television advertising is an effective means of reaching a large target population when marketing consumer products allowing customers the opportunity to immediately answer the call to action and purchase entertainment products directly from the infomercial, thereby generating immediate sales and leads. Infomercials are aired on local broadcast stations and national cable networks in over 200 broadcast markets. The scripts for our initial infomercials will be prepared jointly by the Company to then be formatted filmed through facilities. 14 The Company may also arrange with an independent media company to determine the media buys for broadcast, cable and internet airings. Revenue The Company plans to generate revenues by creating mainstream documentaries, TV and web series that will be licensed to major broadcasters and popular platforms. Management intends that the Company will own the intellectual property of these productions and, therefore, collect license fees, advances and/or royalties in perpetuity for all broadcasts both domestic and international. Competition Video content production and distribution direct to consumers are highly competitive businesses. We face competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, outdoor recreation, video games, the internet and other cultural and computer-related activities. The Company will compete with the major studios, numerous independent motion picture and television production companies, television networks, pay television systems and online media platforms for the services of performing artists, producers and other creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our businesses. In addition, the Companys future video content will compete for media outlet and audience acceptance with video content produced and distributed by other companies. As a result, the success of any of our video content is dependent not only on the quality and acceptance of a particular production, but also on the quality and acceptance of other competing video content available in the marketplace at or near the same time. Given such competition, and our stage of development, we intend to initially emphasize a lower cost structure, risk mitigation, reliance on financial partnerships and innovative financial strategies. Our cost structures are designed to utilize our flexibility and agility as well as the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees, partners and affiliates, in order to provide creative, desirable video content. Most of these competitors have significantly more financial resources than do we. The Companys principal method to compete is to utilize the knowledge, experience and contacts of our management team. We cannot provide any assurances as to the likelihood of our success in this regard. Plan of Operation The following growth strategy and milestones are based on the estimates made by management.

Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 16 Cash and Cash Equivalents . The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with maturities of less than three months when acquired to be cash equivalents. Loss Per Common Share .

Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. In computing the percentage of shares beneficially owned by a selling stockholder, shares of common stock subject to options or warrants, or debt convertible into common stock held by that selling stockholder that was exercisable on or within 60 days after May 23, 2018, were deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that selling stockholder. The ownership percentages are calculated based on the 47,465,000 shares of common stock outstanding on May 23, 2018. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION By Selling Stockholders We are registering shares of our common stock on behalf of the selling shareholders. The selling shareholders will offer and sell the shares of our common stock to which this prospectus relates for their own accounts. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of those shares. We will pay all fees and expenses in connection with the registration of those shares. Fees and expenses of any attorneys or other advisors retained by the selling shareholders in connection with the registration will be paid by the selling shareholders. The selling shareholders may sell some or all of their shares of our common stock registered hereby at a fixed price of $0.05 per share. Prior to those prices being quoted on the OTC Pink, the selling shareholders may sell their shares of our common stock registered hereby in private transactions to other individuals. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange, we intend to apply for participation on the OTC Pink concurrently with the filing of this registration statement. In order to be quoted on the OTC Pink, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, which operates the OTC Pink, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. However, sales by selling shareholders of their shares of our common stock registered hereby must be made at the fixed price of $0.05 until the prices of our common stock are quoted on the OTC Pink. When prices for our common stock are quoted on the OTC Pink, the shares of our common stock registered hereby may be sold or distributed from time to time by the selling shareholders directly to one or more purchasers or through brokers or dealers who act solely as agents, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices, at negotiated prices or at fixed prices, which may be changed. The distribution of those shares may be effected in one or more of the following methods: · ordinary brokers transactions, which may include long or short sales; · transactions involving cross or block trades on any securities or market where our common stock is trading; · through direct sales to purchasers or sales effected through agents; · through transactions in options, swaps or other derivatives (whether exchange listed or otherwise); or · any combination of the foregoing; In addition, the selling shareholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers who may engage in short sales, if short sales were permitted, of those shares in the course of hedging the positions they assume with the selling stockholders. The selling shareholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers that require the delivery by such broker-dealers of those shares, which shares may be resold thereafter pursuant to this prospectus. To our best knowledge, none of the selling shareholders are broker-dealers or affiliates of broker dealers. We will inform the selling shareholders that the anti-manipulation rules of Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may apply to sales of those shares in the market and to the activities of the selling shareholders and their affiliates. In addition, we will make copies of this prospectus (as it may be supplemented or amended from time to time) available to the selling shareholders for the purpose of satisfying the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The selling shareholders may indemnify any broker-dealer that participates in transactions involving the sale of those shares against certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933. 24 Brokers, dealers, or agents participating in the distribution of those shares may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling shareholders and/or the purchasers of shares for whom such broker-dealers may act as agent or to whom they may sell as principal, or both (which compensation as to a particular broker-dealer may be in excess of customary commissions). Neither the selling shareholders nor we can presently estimate the amount of such compensation. We know of no existing arrangements among the selling shareholders and any other shareholder, broker, dealer or agent relating to the sale or distribution of those shares. Our affiliates and/or promoters, if any, who are offering their shares of our common stock for sale and any broker-dealers who act in connection with the sale of the shares of our common stock hereunder will be deemed to be underwriters of this offering within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, and any commissions they receive and proceeds of any sale of the shares may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act of 1933. The selling shareholders and any purchasers of our common stock should be aware that any market that develops for our common stock will be subject to penny stock rules. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities occurring pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to our directors, officers, and controlling persons, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and, therefore, unenforceable. If any of the selling shareholders enter into an agreement after the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part to sell all or a portion of his or her shares of our common stock registered hereby to a broker-dealer as principal and that broker-dealer acts as underwriter, we will file a post-effective amendment to this registration statement identifying that broker-dealer, providing the required information regarding the plan of distribution, revising disclosures in that registration statement, as required, and filing a copy of that agreement as an exhibit to that registration statement. Penny Stock Rules SEC Rule 15g-9 establishes the definition of a penny stock, for purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to a limited number of exceptions. It is probable that our common stock will be considered to be a penny stock for the immediate foreseeable future. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the penny stock rules require that a broker-dealer approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks and the broker-dealer receive from that person, a written agreement to the transaction setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker-dealer must obtain financial information, investment experience, and objectives of that person and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluation the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker-dealer must, also, deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, sets forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the suitability determination and that the broker-dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in, both, public offerings and in secondary trading and commissions payable to, both, the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities, and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. The above requirements may create a lack of liquidity, making trading difficult or impossible and, accordingly, shareholders may find it difficult to dispose of our common stock. 25 State Securities-Blue Sky Laws There is no public market for our common stock, and there can be no assurance that any such market will develop in the foreseeable future. Transfers of our common stock may, also, be restricted under the securities laws promulgated by various states and foreign jurisdictions, commonly referred to as Blue Sky laws. Absent compliance with such laws, our common stock may not be traded in such jurisdictions. Because our common stock registered hereunder has not been registered for resale under the Blue Sky laws of any state, the holders of our common stock and persons who desire to purchase our common stock in any trading market that might develop in the future, should be aware that there may be significant state Blue Sky law restrictions regarding the ability of investors to sell our common stock and of purchasers to purchase our common stock. Accordingly, investors may not be able to liquidate our common stock and should be prepared to hold our common stock for an indefinite period of time. The selling shareholders may contact us directly to ascertain procedures necessary for compliance with Blue Sky laws in the applicable states relating to sellers and purchasers of our common stock. We currently do not intend to and may not be able to qualify our common stock for resale in other states which require our common stock to be qualified before such common stock can be resold by our shareholders. Limitations Imposed By Regulation M Pursuant to applicable rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, any person engaged in the distribution of our common stock may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to our common stock for a period of two business days prior to the commencement of any such distribution. In addition, and without limiting the foregoing, each selling stockholder will be subject to applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the associated rules and regulations thereunder, including, without limitation, Regulation M, which provisions may limit the timing of purchases and sales of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the selling stockholders and inform them of the requirement regarding delivery of copies of this prospectus to purchasers at or prior to the time of any sale of the shares offered hereby. We assume no obligation to deliver copies of this prospectus or any related prospectus supplement. 26 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the shareholders and the board of directors of Tenaya Group Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Tenaya Group Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2017 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows the period from June 23, 2017 (date of incorporation) to December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from June 23, 2017 (date of incorporation) to December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has limited liquidity and has not established a source of revenue to support its costs. The Company requires additional funds to meet its obligations and the costs of its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in this regard are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ DMCL LLP DALE MATHESON CARR-HILTON LABONTE LLP CHARTERED PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS This is our first year of service as the Companys auditor Vancouver, Canada May 23, 2018 F-1 Tenaya Group Inc.

Notes to the Financial Statements December 31, 2017 NOTE 1 - NATURE OF ORGANIZATION Tenaya Group Inc. ("TGI" or the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 23, 2017. The Company is a Hollywood based media branding company. The Company plans to produce feature length documentaries, podcasts and documentary style television series for mainstream broadcasters and popular video on-demand platforms. NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN The Companys financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the period from June 23, 2017 (date of incorporation) through December 31, 2017, the Company had not commenced operations and had an accumulated deficit of $153,614. The Company currently has limited liquidity and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. Management has evaluated these factors and has determined that they raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. The Companys officers have agreed to advance funds to the Company to meet its obligations. NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Accounting The financial statements present the balance sheet, statements of operations and cash flows, and changes in stockholders' equity of the Company. These financial statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The Companys financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting, except for cash flow information. The Company has elected a December 31 fiscal year end. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Companys estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. Loss Per Share Net loss per share is computed based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue Common Stock were exercised or converted into Common Stock. The Company had no dilutive securities. F-6 Income Taxes Income tax expense is based on pre-tax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carry forwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

F-7 NOTE 5 - INCOME TAXES A reconciliation of the income tax provision computed at statutory rates to the reported income tax provision for the period ended December 31, 2017 is as follows: Statutory tax rate 34% Net loss $ (153,614) Expected recovery (52,229) Effect of change in enacted statutory tax rate 19,970 Change in valuation allowance 32,259 $ - The significant components of the Companys deferred income tax assets after applying enacted corporate tax rates at December 31, 2017 is as follows: Operating loss carryforward $ 32,259 Valuation allowance (32,259) $ - F-8 DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION IN INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES Pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the corporation, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any proceeding, including a law suit, because of her/her position, if he/she acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in our best interest. In certain cases, we may advance expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in any such proceeding as to which such person is to be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorneys fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
