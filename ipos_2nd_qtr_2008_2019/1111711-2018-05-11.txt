Unless the context requires otherwise, we, us or our refer collectively to NiSource Inc. and its subsidiaries. NiSource Inc. Overview. NiSource is an energy holding company whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving approximately 3.9 million customers in seven states. We are one of the nations largest natural gas distribution companies, as measured by number of customers. Our principal subsidiaries include NiSource Gas Distribution Group, Inc., a natural gas distribution company, and Northern Indiana Public Service Company, or NIPSCO, a gas and electric company. NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating results of these rate-regulated businesses. Our primary business segments are:  Gas Distribution Operations; and  Electric Operations . On July 1, 2015, we completed the spin-off of our former subsidiary Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc., which comprised all of our Columbia Pipeline Group Operations segment prior to that time. Business Strategy. We focus our business strategy on our core, rate-regulated asset-based businesses, with most of our operating income generated from the rate-regulated businesses. NiSources utilities continue to move forward on core infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all seven states in which we operate. Our goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as we address changing customer conservation patterns, develop more contemporary pricing structures and embark on long-term investment programs. These strategies will help improve reliability and safety, enhance customer services and reduce emissions while generating sustainable returns. Gas Distribution Operations. Our natural gas distribution operations serve approximately 3.5 million customers in seven states and operate approximately 60,000 miles of pipeline. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary NiSource Gas Distribution Group, Inc., we own six distribution subsidiaries that provide natural gas to approximately 2.6 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland and Massachusetts. We also distribute natural gas to approximately 830,000 customers in northern Indiana through our wholly-owned subsidiary NIPSCO. Electric Operations. We generate, transmit and distribute electricity through our subsidiary NIPSCO to approximately 469,000 customers in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana and engage in wholesale and transmission transactions. NIPSCO owns and operates three coal-fired electric generating stations. The three operating facilities have a net capability of 2,540 megawatts. NIPSCO also owns and operates Sugar Creek, a combined cycle gas turbine plant with a net capability of 535 megawatts, three gas-fired generating units located at NIPSCOs coal-fired electric generating stations with a net capability of 196 megawatts and two hydroelectric generating plants with a net capability of 10 megawatts. These facilities provide for a total system operating net capability of 3,281 megawatts. NIPSCOs transmission system, with voltages from 69,000 to 345,000 volts, consists of 2,843 circuit miles. NIPSCO is interconnected with five neighboring electric utilities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, NIPSCO generated 65.2% and purchased 34.8% of its electric requirements. NIPSCO plans to retire Bailly Generating Station (Units 7 and 8) by May 31, 2018.

This means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you to another document that NiSource has filed separately with the SEC. The information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this prospectus. Any statement contained in this prospectus or a document incorporated by reference in this prospectus will be deemed to be modified or superseded for purposes of this prospectus to the extent that a statement contained in this prospectus or in any other subsequently filed document that is incorporated by reference in this prospectus modifies or supersedes the statement. Any statement so modified or superseded will not be deemed, except as so modified or superseded, to constitute a part of this prospectus. You should not assume that the information in this prospectus is current as of the date other than the date on the cover page of this prospectus. The following documents previously filed by us with the SEC are incorporated by reference in this prospectus:  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as filed on February 20, 2018, including the portions of our definitive proxy statement dated April 6, 2018, as filed on April 6, 2018, incorporated by reference therein;  Our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as filed on May 2, 2018; and  Our Current Reports on Form 8-K, as filed with the SEC on January 26, 2018, March 29, 2018, April 19, 2018, May 2, 2018 (reporting Items 1.01, 7.01 and 9.01 but only incorporating by reference the information filed, and not furnished, therein), May 7, 2018 and May 9, 2018. We will provide without charge to each person, including any beneficial owner, to whom this prospectus is delivered, upon written or oral request, a copy of any or all of the reports or documents that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus, but not delivered with the prospectus, other than exhibits to such documents unless such exhibits are specifically incorporated by reference into the documents that this prospectus incorporates. Requests for those documents should be directed to Samuel K. Lee, NiSource Inc., 801 East 86th Avenue, Merrillville, Indiana 46410, telephone: (877) 647-5990. In addition, each document incorporated by reference is readily accessible on our website at www.nisource.com. Except for the documents listed above, the information contained on our website or that can be accessed through our website is not incorporated by reference herein. 3 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS Investing in our common stock involves risk. Please see the Risk Factors and Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements sections in NiSources Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, and in NiSources Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which are incorporated by reference in this prospectus. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider these risks as well as the risks described below and other information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and any supplemental prospectus. Any of these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. If that occurs, the trading price of our common stock could decline materially and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks described herein and in the documents we have incorporated by reference into this prospectus are not the only risks we face. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that result from developments occurring in the future. Conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Past financial and operational performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Sales of shares in connection with this offering may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. On May 2, 2018, we entered into a common stock subscription agreement with the selling stockholders pursuant to which we sold to the selling stockholders, in a private placement, an aggregate of 24,964,163 newly issued shares of our common stock. We have agreed to file the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part to register with the SEC the resale of such shares of common stock by the selling stockholders. Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement, the shares we sold in the private placement may be freely sold in the open market. The sale of a significant amount of these shares of common stock in the open market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or become highly volatile. 4 Table of Contents NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the information included in this prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the securities laws. Investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether any forward-looking statement contained herein will be or can be realized. Any one of those factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning NiSources plans, strategies, objectives, expected performance, expenditures, recovery of expenditures through rates, stated on either a consolidated or segment basis, and any and all underlying assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical fact. All forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations include, among other things, our debt obligations; any changes in our credit rating; our ability to execute our growth strategy; changes in general economic, capital and commodity market conditions; pension funding obligations; economic regulation and the impact of regulatory rate reviews; our ability to obtain expected financial or regulatory outcomes; advances in technology; any damage to our reputation; compliance with environmental laws and the costs of associated liabilities; fluctuations in demand from residential and commercial customers; economic conditions of certain industries; the success of NIPSCOs electric generation strategy; the price of energy commodities and related transportation costs; the reliability of customers and suppliers to fulfill their payment and contractual obligations; potential impairments of goodwill or definite-lived intangible assets; changes in taxation and accounting principles; potential incidents and other operating risks associated with our business; the impact of an aging infrastructure; the impact of climate change; potential cyber-attacks; construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks; extreme weather conditions; the attraction and retention of a qualified workforce; the ability of our subsidiaries to generate cash; tax liabilities associated with the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. on July 1, 2015; our ability to manage new initiatives and organizational changes; the performance of certain third-party suppliers upon which we rely; our ability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage; and other matters set forth in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, many of which risks are beyond our control. In addition, the relative contributions to profitability by each business segment, and the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements relating thereto, may change over time. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. We undertake no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any such obligation to, update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or changes to the future results over time or otherwise, except as required by law. 5 Table of Contents USE OF PROCEEDS The common stock to be offered and sold using this prospectus will be offered and sold by the selling stockholders named in this prospectus. See Selling Stockholders. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in this offering. SELLING STOCKHOLDERS This prospectus relates to the possible resale of up to an aggregate of 24,964,163 shares of common stock by the selling stockholders identified below. The selling stockholders acquired the shares of common stock offered hereby in a private placement that closed on May 4, 2018. On May 2, 2018, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the selling stockholders pursuant to which we were obligated to prepare and file a registration statement to permit the resale of the common stock held by the selling shareholders from time to time. The table below sets forth:  the names of the selling stockholders;  the number and percentage of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the selling stockholders prior to the selling stockholders offering of the shares of common stock pursuant to this prospectus;  the maximum number of shares of common stock which may be offered by the selling stockholders pursuant to this prospectus; and  the number and percentage of shares of common stock to be beneficially owned by the selling stockholders after the offering of common stock pursuant to this prospectus, assuming all shares of common stock being offered are sold by the selling stockholders and that the selling stockholders do not acquire any additional shares of common stock. The number of shares disclosed in the table below as beneficially owned are those beneficially owned as determined under the rules of the SEC. Such information is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose. The information in the table below (other than the percentages of outstanding common stock beneficially owned) was furnished by or on behalf of the selling stockholders and is as of May 4, 2018. We believe, based on information supplied by the selling stockholders, that except as may otherwise be indicated in the footnotes to the table below, the selling stockholders have sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the common stock reported as beneficially owned by them. We have not sought to verify such information. Except as may be noted below, none of the selling stockholders has, or within the past three years has had, any material relationship with us or any of our affiliates. No offer or sale under this prospectus may be made by a stockholder unless that holder is listed in the table below, in a supplement to this prospectus or in an amendment to the related registration statement that has become effective. We will supplement or amend this prospectus to include additional selling stockholders upon provision of all required information to us and subject to the terms of the relevant agreement between us and the selling stockholders. The selling stockholders are not obligated to sell any of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus. Because the selling stockholders identified in the table may sell some or all of the shares of common stock owned by them that are included in this prospectus, and because there are currently no agreements, arrangements or understandings with respect to the sale of any of such shares, no estimate can be given as to the number of shares covered by this prospectus that will be held by the selling stockholders upon termination of this offering. In addition, the selling stockholders may have sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, at any time and from time to time, shares of common stock they hold in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act after the date on which they provided the information set forth on the table below. Therefore, for purposes of the following table we have assumed that the selling stockholders will sell all of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by them that are covered by this prospectus, but will not sell any other shares of our common stock that they may currently own. 6 Table of Contents Common Stock Beneficially Owned Prior to the Offering Shares of Common Stock Being Offered Hereby Common Stock Beneficially Owned After Completion of the Offering** Shares Percentage(1) Shares Percentage(1) Selling Stockholders: Funds advised by Capital Research and Management Company (2) 8,277,405 2.3 % 8,238,997 38,408 * MFS Series Trust I - MFS Core Equity Fund (3) 74,255 * 74,255 0  MFS Variable Insurance Trust II - MFS Core Equity Portfolio (3) 8,090 * 8,090 0  MFS Series Trust VI - MFS Utilities Fund (3) 385,647 * 385,647 0  MainStay VP Funds Trust - MainStay VP MFS Utilities Portfolio (3) 147,267 * 147,267 0  SunAmerica Series Trust - SA MFS Telecom Utility Portfolio (3) 4,132 * 4,132 0  John Hancock Variable Insurance Trust - Utilities Trust (3) 31,522 * 31,522 0  MFS Variable Insurance Trust - MFS Utilities Series (3) 172,987 * 172,987 0  Citadel Global Equities Master Fund Ltd.

Common Stock NiSource common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NI. Common stockholders may receive dividends if and when declared by the board of directors. Dividends may be paid in cash, stock or other form. In certain cases, common stockholders may not receive dividends until obligations to any preferred stockholders have been satisfied. All common stock will be fully paid and non-assessable. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote in the election of directors and other matters. Common stockholders are not entitled to preemptive rights or cumulative voting rights. Common stockholders will be notified of any stockholders meeting according to applicable law. If NiSource liquidates, dissolves or winds-up its business, either voluntarily or involuntarily, common stockholders will share equally in the assets remaining after creditors and preferred stockholders are paid. Anti-Takeover Provisions The certificate of incorporation of NiSource includes provisions that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control of management of NiSource. Stockholders may not cumulate their votes, and stockholder action may be taken only at a duly called meeting and not by written consent. The board of directors may, without approval of stockholders, issue one or more series of preferred stock and determine the number of shares of each series, the rights, preferences and limitations of each series, including any dividend rights, voting rights, conversion rights, redemption rights and liquidation preferences, and the terms and conditions of issue. In some cases, the issuance of preferred stock could delay a change in control of NiSource and make it harder to remove incumbent management. In addition, NiSources bylaws contain requirements for advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations. These and other provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of management of NiSource. NiSource is subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law regulating corporate takeovers. Section 203 prevents certain Delaware corporations, including those whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, from engaging, under certain circumstances, in a business combination, which includes a merger or sale of more than 10% of the corporations assets, with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a stockholder who acquired 15% or more of the corporations outstanding voting stock without the prior approval of the corporations board of directors. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION As of the date of this prospectus, we have not been advised by the selling stockholders as to any plan of distribution. The selling stockholders, or their pledgees, donees (including charitable organizations), transferees or other successors-in-interest, may from time to time, sell any or all of the common stock offered by this prospectus directly by such individual, through broker-dealers acting as principal or agent, or pursuant to a distribution by one or more underwriters on a firm commitment or best-efforts basis, on any exchange on which the common stock may from time to time be traded, in the over-the-counter market, or in independently negotiated transactions or otherwise. The selling stockholders will determine the prices at which they may sell shares of common stock offered by this prospectus, and such sales may be made at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. The selling stockholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling our common stock:  ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the common stock as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;  any exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;  privately negotiated transactions;  settlement of short sales entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which the prospectus will form a part;  broker-dealers may agree with the selling stockholders to sell a specified number of such common stock at a stipulated price per share; 10 Table of Contents  through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;  a combination of any such methods of sale; or  any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. To the extent required, this prospectus may be amended and/or supplemented from time to time to describe a specific plan of distribution. The selling stockholders may also sell common stock under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), if available, or otherwise as permitted pursuant to applicable law, rather than under this prospectus. Broker-dealers engaged by the selling stockholders may arrange for other broker-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of the common stock under this prospectus, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to the prospectus, in the case of any agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Rule 2121 and, in the case of a principal transaction, a markup or markdown in compliance with Rule 2121. In connection with sales of the common stock under this prospectus or interests therein, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The selling stockholders may also sell the common stock short and deliver shares of common stock to close their short positions, or loan or pledge the common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell the common stock. The selling stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares of common stock offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the selling stockholders have been advised that they may not use the common stock registered on the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part to cover short sales of the common stock made prior to the date the registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC. The selling stockholders may from time to time pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the common stock owned by them and, if they default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell common stock from time to time under this prospectus, or under an amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the Securities Act, amending, if necessary, the list of selling stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling stockholders under this prospectus. The selling stockholders may also transfer and donate the common stock in other circumstances in which case the transferees, donees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus. In connection with an underwritten offering, underwriters or agents may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling stockholders or from purchasers of the common stock for whom they may act as agents. In addition, the selling stockholders and any underwriters, dealers or agents that participate in the distribution of the securities may be deemed to be underwriters, and any profit on sale of the securities by them and any discounts, commissions or concessions received by any underwriter, dealer or agent may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act. The selling stockholders may agree to indemnify an underwriter, broker-dealer or agent against certain liabilities related to the selling of their shares, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act. Under the registration rights agreement entered into with the selling stockholders, we have agreed to indemnify the selling stockholders against certain liabilities related to the sale of our common stock, including certain liabilities arising under the Securities Act. Under the registration rights agreement, we have also agreed to pay the costs, expenses and fees of registering the shares of our common stock. All other expenses of issuance and distribution will be borne by the selling stockholders. The selling stockholders are subject to the applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), and the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, including Regulation M. This regulation may limit the timing of purchases and sales of any of the shares of common stock offered in this prospectus by the selling stockholders. The anti-manipulation rules under the Exchange Act may apply to sales of shares in the market and to the activities of the selling stockholders and their affiliates. Furthermore, Regulation M may restrict the ability of any person engaged in the distribution of the shares to engage in market-making activities for the particular securities being distributed for a period of up to five business days before the distribution. The restrictions may affect the marketability of the shares and the ability of any person or entity to engage in market-making activities for the shares. 11 Table of Contents There can be no assurances that the selling stockholders will sell any or all of the securities offered under this prospectus.

Section B.2. of Article V of NiSource Inc.s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, pursuant to Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, provides that NiSource Inc. will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as then in effect, indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed investigation, claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including, without limitation, any employee benefit plan) against all expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any such investigation, claim, action, suit or proceeding, provided that such person acted in good faith and in a manner that he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, if he or she had no reason to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Section B.2. of Article V of NiSource Inc.s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, pursuant to Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, also provides that if the investigation, claim, action, suit or proceeding is a derivative action (meaning one brought by or on behalf of the corporation), NiSource Inc. will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, as then in effect, indemnify any person against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such investigation, claim, action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification may be made in respect to any investigation, claim, action, suit, proceeding or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his or her duty to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which the action or suit is brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in light of the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expense as the court deems proper. NiSource Inc.s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and the General Corporation Law of Delaware permits NiSource Inc. and its subsidiaries to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is a director or officer for acts committed in their capacities as such directors or officers.

On May 4, 2018, NiSource sold an aggregate of 24,964,163 shares of NiSource common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for an aggregate offering price of $606,005,057 in a private placement to certain institutional investors. The offer and sale of the shares were made in reliance upon an exemption from registration provided under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. In determining that the offer and sale of the shares qualified for this exemption, NiSource relied on, among other things, the following facts: (i) all of the purchasers were accredited investors or qualified institutional buyers, (ii) NiSource did not use any form of general solicitation or advertising to offer the shares and (iii) each of the purchasers represented that it was purchasing the shares for investment purposes. The sale of the shares resulted in approximately $599,547,000 of net proceeds (after deducting placement agent commissions and NiSources expenses, including the expenses of this offering). The Company intends to use the net proceeds to finance capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. Item 16. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. (a) Exhibits. Reference is made to the information in the Exhibit Index filed as part of this registration statement. (b) Financial Statement Schedules. The following financial statement schedule is incorporated herein by reference to the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017: Schedule II  Valuation and Qualifying Accounts. Item 17. Undertakings. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: (a) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of this registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in this registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in this registration statement or any material change to such information in this registration statement. Provided, however, that paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in periodic reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the registrant pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement. (b) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (c) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. II-2 Table of Contents (d) That, for purposes of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser, if the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness; provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. (e) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
