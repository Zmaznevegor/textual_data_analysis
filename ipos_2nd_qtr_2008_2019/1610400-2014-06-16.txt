Unless otherwise noted, all information in this prospectus assumes no exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares and gives effect to the one-for- reverse split of our outstanding shares of common stock that we effected on , 2014. Our Company We are the largest distributor of replacement tires in North America. We provide a wide range of products and value-added services to customers in each of the key market channels to enable tire retailers to more effectively service and grow sales to consumers. Through our network of more than 140 distribution centers in the United States and Canada, we offer access to an extensive breadth and depth of inventory, representing more than 40,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs), to approximately 80,000 customers. In 2013, we distributed more than 40 million replacement tires after giving effect to recent acquisitions. We estimate that our share of the replacement passenger and light truck tire market in 2013, after giving effect to our recently completed acquisitions, would have been approximately 14% in the United States, up from approximately 1% in 1996, and approximately 18% in Canada. Geographic Footprint 1 We serve a highly diversified customer base across multiple channels, comprised of local, regional and national independent tire retailers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, tire manufacturer-owned stores, automotive dealerships and web-based marketers. We have a significant market presence in a number of these key market channels and we believe that we are the only replacement tire distributor in North America that services each of these key market channels. During fiscal 2013, our largest customer and top ten customers accounted for 3.1% and 11.3%, respectively, of our net sales. We believe we are a top supplier to many of our customers and have maintained relationships with our top 20 customers that exceed a decade on average. We believe we distribute one of the broadest product offerings in our industry, supplying our customers with nine of the top ten leading passenger and light truck tire brands. We carry the flag brands from each of the four largest tire manufacturers Bridgestone , Continental, Goodyear and Michelin as well as the Cooper , Hankook, Kumho, Nexen, Nitto and Pirelli brands. We also sell lower price point associate and proprietary brands of these and many other tire manufacturers, and through our acquisition of The Hercules Tire and Rubber Company (Hercules) we also own and market our proprietary Hercules ® brand, the number one private brand in North America in 2013 based on unit sales. In addition, we sell custom wheels and accessories and related tire supplies and tools. We believe that our large and diverse product offering allows us to penetrate the replacement tire market across a broad range of price points. Our growth strategy, coupled with our access to capital and our scalable platform, enables us to continue to expand organically in existing markets as well as in new geographic areas. We also expect to continue to employ a selective acquisition strategy to increase our share in the markets we currently service as well as to expand our distribution into new markets, utilizing our scale in an effort to realize significant synergies. In addition, we are investing in technology and each sales channel to fuel our future growth. As a result, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to achieve above-market growth in all market environments and to continue to enhance our profitability and cash flows. From fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2013, net sales increased from $2.2 billion to $3.8 billion, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 15.3%, and Adjusted EBITDA increased from $101.0 million to $195.5 million, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 17.9%. Over the same period, according to the RMA, unit volume in the U.S. replacement tire market grew at a compound annual growth rate of 1.2%. Our superior growth was driven by our organic initiatives and our acquisitions. In fiscal 2009, our net income was $4.9 million and in fiscal 2013 our net loss was $6.4 million. This decrease in net income was primarily the result of increased interest expense related to our acquisition by TPG in 2010, as well as interest associated with our eight acquisitions from 2010 through 2013, and non-cash amortization expense related to our intangible assets. For the quarter ended April 5, 2014 and the year ended December 28, 2013, our net sales were $1.2 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, our Adjusted EBITDA was $31.3 million and $231.8 million, respectively, and our net loss was $52.9 million and $55.2 million, respectively, in each case including the pro forma effects of our recent acquisitions. Additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, including a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) and a reconciliation of pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma net income (loss), is included in Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Data. Additional information regarding the pro forma effects of our recent acquisitions is included in Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Data and Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information. Our Industry According to Modern Tire Dealer, the U.S. replacement tire market generated annual retail sales of approximately $37.3 billion in 2013. Passenger tires, medium truck tires and light truck tires accounted for 66.9%, 16.9% and 13.1%, respectively, of the total U.S. market. Farm, specialty and other types of tires accounted for the remaining 3.1% of the total U.S. market. The Canadian replacement tire market generated annual retail sales of approximately $3.7 billion in 2012. Passenger and light truck tires accounted for 53% while 2 commercial tires accounted for 20% of the total Canadian replacement tire market. Farm, specialty and other types of tires accounted for the remaining 27% of the total Canadian replacement tire market. According to a Tire Review survey conducted in 2013 , U.S. tire dealers buy 55.4% of their consumer tires from wholesale distributors like us and 27.7% direct from tire manufacturers, with the remaining volume coming from various other sources. In the United States and Canada, replacement tires are sold to consumers through several different channels, including local, regional and national independent tire retailers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, tire manufacturer-owned stores, automotive dealerships and web-based marketers. Between 1990 and 2013, independent tire retailers and automotive dealerships have enjoyed the largest increase in U.S. replacement tire market share, according to Modern Tire Dealer , moving from 54% to 60.5% and 1% to 7.5% of the market, respectively. In 2012, replacement tire sales to independent tire retailers and automotive dealerships represented approximately 44% and 18%, respectively, of Canadian replacement tire market share. Mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, manufacturer-owned stores and web-based marketers comprise the remaining market share in both the United States and Canada. Since 2000, the number of specific tire sizes in the market has increased by 61%. One driver of this increase was above-market growth in high-performance tires, which experienced a compound annual growth rate of approximately 9% between 2000 and 2008. The increase in the number of tire sizes, coupled with the large number of brands in the market place, has driven SKU proliferation in the replacement tire market. As a result of this SKU proliferation and due to their capital and physical space constraints, many tire retailers are unable to carry sufficient inventory to meet the demands of their customers. This trend has helped increase the need for distributors in the replacement tire market. The U.S. and Canadian replacement tire markets have historically experienced stable growth and favorable pricing dynamics. However, these markets are subject to changes in consumer confidence and economic conditions. As a result, tire consumers may opt to temporarily defer replacement tire purchases or purchase less costly brands during challenging economic periods when macroeconomic factors such as unemployment, high fuel costs and weakness in the housing market impact their financial health. From 1955 through 2013, U.S. replacement tire unit shipments increased by an average of approximately 3% per year. We believe that we are experiencing the beginning of a recovery after a prolonged downturn, which began in 2008 for the replacement tire market. Replacement tire unit shipments were up 4.4% in the United States and 0.7% in Canada in 2013 as compared to 2012, as a rebound in the housing market, a decline in unemployment rates and increases in vehicle sales and vehicle miles driven impacted the U.S. and Canadian replacement tire markets favorably. The RMA projects that replacement tire shipments will increase by approximately 2% in the United States in 2014 as compared to 2013, as demand drivers continue to strengthen. Going forward, we believe that long-term growth in the U.S. and Canadian replacement tire markets will continue to be driven by favorable underlying dynamics, including:  increases in the number and average age of passenger cars and light trucks;  increases in the number of miles driven;  increases in the number of licensed drivers as the U.S. and Canadian population continues to grow;  increases in the number of replacement tire SKUs;  growth of the high-performance tire market; and  shortening of tire replacement cycles due to changes in product mix that increasingly favor high-performance tires, which have shorter average lives. 3 Our Competitive Strengths We believe the following key strengths have enabled us to become the largest distributor of replacement tires in North America and position us to achieve future revenue growth in excess of the long-term growth rates of the U.S. and Canadian replacement tire industry: Leading Position in a Large and Highly Fragmented Marketplace. We are the largest distributor of replacement tires in North America with an estimated market share in 2013 of approximately 14%, after giving effect to our recently completed acquisitions, in a $37.3 billion market in the United States. Our estimated market share in 2013 of the replacement passenger and light truck tire market in Canada was approximately 18%, after giving effect to our recently completed acquisitions. We believe our scale provides us key competitive advantages relative to our smaller, and generally regionally-focused, competitors. These include the ability to: efficiently stock and deliver a wide variety of tires; invest in services, including sales tools and technologies, to support our customers; and realize operating efficiencies from our scalable infrastructure. We believe our leading market position and presence in each of the key market channels, combined with our commitment to distribution, as opposed to the retail operations engaged in by our customers, enhances our ability to expand our sales footprint cost effectively both in our existing markets and in new domestic geographic markets. Scale Advantage from Extensive and Efficient Distribution Network. We believe we have the largest independent replacement tire distribution network in North America with more than 140 distribution centers (excluding distribution centers acquired in our recent acquisitions that are expected to be closed as part of the integration process) and approximately 1,000 delivery vehicles. Our distribution footprint services geographic regions in the United States that represented more than 90% of the replacement tire market for passenger and light truck tires in 2013, and we believe our geographic coverage in Canada is also very extensive. Our extensive distribution footprint, combined with sophisticated inventory management and logistics technologies, enables us to deliver the vast majority of orders on a same or next day basis, which is critical for tire retailers who are typically limited by physical inventory capacity and working capital constraints. Our delivery technologies allow us to more effectively and efficiently organize and optimize our route systems to provide timely product delivery. Our distribution systems are integrated with our proprietary business-to-business ATDOnline ® order fulfillment system that captures more than 65% of our orders electronically, and our Oracle enterprise resource planning (ERP) system provides a scalable platform that can support future growth and ongoing cost reduction initiatives, including warehouse and truck management systems, which we believe will allow us to continue reducing warehouse and delivery costs per unit. Broad Product Offering from Diverse Supplier Base . We believe we offer the most comprehensive selection of passenger and light truck tires in the industry through a diverse group of suppliers. We supply nine of the top ten leading passenger and light truck tire brands, and we carry the flag brands from each of the four largest tire manufacturers Bridgestone , Continental , Goodyear and Michelin as well as the Cooper , Hankook , Kumho , Nexen , Nitto and Pirelli brands. Our tire product line includes a full suite of flag, associate and proprietary brand tires, allowing us to service a broad range of price points from entry-level imported products to the faster-growing high- performance category. Through our acquisition of Hercules, we also own and market our proprietary Hercules ® brand, the number one private brand in North America in 2013 based on unit sales. In addition to tires, we also offer custom wheels and accessories and related tire supplies and tools. We believe that our broad product offering drives increased sales among existing customers, attracts new customers and increases customer retention. Broad Range of Value-Added Services. We provide a wide range of services that enable our tire retailer customers to operate their businesses more profitably. These services include convenient access to and timely delivery of the broadest product offerings available in the industry, as well as fundamental business support services, such as administration of tire manufacturer affiliate programs and credit, training and access to consumer market data, which enable our tire retailer customers to better service their individual markets. We provide our U.S. customers with convenient 24/7 access to our extensive product offerings through our 4 innovative and proprietary business-to-business web portal, ATDOnline ® . Our online services also include TireBuyer.com ® , which allows our U.S. independent tire retailers the ability to participate in the Internet marketing of tires to consumers. We also provide select, qualified U.S. independent tire retailers with the opportunity to participate in our Tire Pros ® franchise program through which they receive advertising and marketing support and the benefits of a national brand identity. We believe our value-added services as well as the integration between our infrastructure and our customers operations enable us to maintain high rates of customer retention and build strong customer loyalty. Diversified Customer Base and Longstanding Customer Relationships Across Multiple Channels. We serve a highly diversified customer base in each of the key market channels, including local, regional and national independent tire retailers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, tire manufacturer-owned stores, automotive dealerships and web-based marketers. We believe we are the only distributor of replacement tires in North America that services each of these key market channels. Our business is diversified across the key market channels and reflects the evolving complexity of the North American replacement tire market, with independent tire retailers accounting for 76% of our net sales in 2013 as compared to 85% of our net sales in 2009. We believe we are a top supplier to many of our customers and maintain relationships with our top 20 customers that exceed a decade on average. We believe the diversity of our customer base and the strength of our customer relationships present an opportunity to grow market share regardless of macroeconomic and replacement tire market conditions. Consistent Financial Performance and Strong Cash Flow Generation. Our financial performance has benefited from substantial growth that has been achieved through a combination of organic initiatives and acquisitions. Over the ten-year period from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2013, our net sales grew at a compound annual rate of 13.2%, reflecting our strong revenue base, evolving business mix, scalable operating model and successful growth strategies. In addition, we believe the low capital intensity of our business combined with the efficient management of our working capital, due in part to our advanced inventory management systems in the United States that we are also in the process of implementing in Canada, and close vendor relationships, will enable us to generate strong cash flows. In addition, as a result of our presence in each major channel within the replacement tire market and based upon our ability to rationalize our operating costs, as necessary, we experienced only moderate margin contraction during the recent economic downturn. Experienced Management Team Supported by Strong Equity Sponsorship. Our senior management team, led by our President and Chief Executive Officer William E. Berry, has an average of over 20 years of experience in the replacement tire distribution industry. Management has a proven track record of implementing successful initiatives in a leveraged environment, including the execution of a disciplined acquisition strategy, which has contributed to our gross profit expansion and above-market net sales growth. In addition, we have reduced costs through the integration of operating systems and introduction of standard operating practices, particularly in the United States, resulting in improved operating efficiencies, reduced headcount and improved operating profit at existing and acquired locations. We also benefit from the extensive management and business experience provided by our Sponsor, TPG. Our Business Strategy Our objective is to further expand our position as the largest distributor of replacement tires in North America and establish our company as the leading distributor in each of the key market channels that we serve, while continuing to provide our customers with a range of value-added services such as frequent and timely delivery of inventory, the broadest and deepest range of products, and other business support services. We intend to accomplish this objective, drive above-market growth and further enhance our profitability and cash flows by executing on the following key operating strategies: Grow Organically in Excess of Market. It is at the core of our strategy to grow our profits and cash flows organically through further penetration of all of our key market channels, through greenfield expansion, 5 through further penetration of our Hercules ® brand, the number one private brand in North America in 2013 based on unit sales, through further establishment and expansion of TireBuyer.com ® , and through further expansion and development of our value-added services. Expand Penetration in Each of the Key Market Channels. We have a significant presence in each of the key market channels, including local, regional and national independent tire retailers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, tire manufacturer-owned stores, automotive dealerships and web-based marketers. We regularly seek opportunities to grow our market share in each channel by customizing our sales strategies to suit the particular needs of that channel, and are focused on training and deploying sales personnel to help build our sales, particularly in the faster-growing automotive dealership channel, and strengthen and expand our relationships with retailers. We have observed an increase in sales through web-based marketers and seek to grow our presence in that channel through our Internet site, TireBuyer.com ® . Continue Greenfield Expansion in Existing and New Geographic Markets. While we already have the largest distribution footprint in the North American replacement tire market, servicing geographic regions in the United States that represented more than 90% of the replacement tire market for passenger and light truck tires in 2013 and with geographic coverage in Canada that we believe is also very extensive, we believe there are numerous further underserved areas in both our existing geographic markets as well as in areas not currently serviced by us that are favorably situated to support and grow additional distribution centers. Since 2010, we have successfully opened 23 greenfield distribution centers, and we intend to continue to expand our existing footprint in the United States and Canada in areas where we see opportunities. Expand our Hercules ® Brand . Through our recently completed acquisition of Hercules, we now market the proprietary Hercules ® brand, the number one private brand in North America in 2013 based on unit sales. We believe our expansive distribution network in the United States and Canada, combined with our greater access to capital, will allow us to both expand product availability and increase market share of the Hercules ® brand. Further, we expect that Hercules multi-decade Asian sourcing experience, including its 250,000 square foot warehouse in northern China, will enhance our supply and distribution capabilities. Grow TireBuyer.com ® into a Premier Internet Tire Provider. TireBuyer.com ® is an Internet site that enables our U.S. independent tire retailer customers to connect with consumers and sell to them over the Internet. TireBuyer.com ® allows our broad base of independent tire retailers to participate in a greater share of the growing Internet tire market. We believe that TireBuyer.com ® complements and services our participating U.S. independent tire retailers by providing them access to a sales and marketing channel previously unavailable to them. In 2012, the TireBuyer.com ® site was re-launched on a newer, faster and more flexible platform, which has enhanced the overall consumer experience and resulted in increased traffic to the site. Continue to Develop and Expand our Value-Added Services . Our Tire Pros ® franchise program enables us to deliver advertising and marketing support to tire retailers operating as Tire Pros ® franchisees. The Tire Pros ® franchise program allows participating local tire retailers to enjoy the benefits of a national brand identity with minimal investment, while still maintaining their local identities. In return, we benefit from increasing volume penetration among, and further aligning ourselves with, our franchisees. We are focused on continuing to upgrade and improve the Tire Pros ® franchise program and seek opportunities to develop similar programs in the future. In addition, individual manufacturers offer a variety of relatively complex programs for tire retailers that sell their products, providing cooperative advertising funds, volume discounts and other incentives. As part of our service to our customers, we assist them in managing the administration of these programs through dedicated staff. We believe these enhancements, combined with other aspects of our customer service, provide significant value to our customers. 6 Selectively Pursue Acquisitions . We expect to continue to employ a selective acquisition strategy to increase our share in the markets we currently service as well as to expand our distribution into new markets, utilizing our scale in an effort to realize significant synergies. Over the past six years we have successfully acquired and integrated nine businesses representing, in the aggregate, over $850 million in annual revenue through 2013, and on a pro forma basis, including our recently completed acquisitions of Hercules and Terrys Tire Town Holdings, Inc. (Terrys Tire), the 2013 annual revenue of businesses acquired is over $2 billion in the aggregate. We believe our position as the largest distributor of replacement tires in North America, combined with our access to capital and our scalable platform, has allowed us to make acquisitions at very attractive post-synergy valuations. Leverage Our Infrastructure in Existing Markets. Through infrastructure expansions over the past several years in the United States, we have developed a scalable platform with available incremental distribution capacity. Our distribution infrastructure enables us to efficiently add new customers, such as corporate accounts, and service growing channels, such as automotive dealerships, thereby increasing profitability by leveraging the utilization of our existing assets. We expect to complete the implementation of a similar platform in Canada near the beginning of 2015. We believe our relative penetration in existing markets is largely a function of the services we offer and the length of time we have operated locally. Specifically, in new geographic markets, we have experienced growth in market share over time, and in markets that we have served the longest, we generally have market share well in excess of our national average. Utilize Technology Platform to Continue to Increase Distribution Efficiency. We intend to continue to invest in our inventory and warehouse management systems and logistics technology in order to further increase our efficiency and profit margins and improve customer service. For example, we operate on our Oracle ERP platform in the United States and are in the process of implementing it in Canada. We continue to evaluate and incorporate technical solutions including utilization of handheld scanning for receiving, picking and delivery of products to our customers. We believe these increased efficiencies will continue to enhance our reputation with our customers for providing timely service, while also reducing costs. Additionally, we continue to roll out customized electronic solutions and point of sale (POS) system integration for our larger customers. Maintain a Comprehensive and Deep Tire Portfolio to Meet Our Customers Needs. We provide a broad range of products covering a broad range of price points from entry-level imported products to faster-growing high-performance tires, through a full suite of flag, associate and proprietary brand tires. We acquired the Hercules ® brand in January 2014 and intend to further expand its market presence throughout North America. We intend to continue to focus on high-performance tires, given the growth in demand for such tires, while maintaining our emphasis on providing broad and entry level tire offerings. Our comprehensive tire portfolio is designed to satisfy all of our customers needs and allow us to become the supplier of choice, thereby increasing customer penetration and retention across all channels. Recent Developments As part of our ongoing business strategy, we intend to expand organically in existing markets as well as enter into previously underserved markets and new geographic areas. Since the second half of 2010, we opened new distribution centers in 23 locations throughout the contiguous United States. We expect to continue to evaluate additional geographic markets during the remainder of 2014 and beyond. On March 28, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Terrys Tire. Terrys Tire and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of purchasing, marketing, distributing and selling tires, wheels and related tire and wheel accessories on a wholesale basis to tire dealers, wholesale distributors, retail chains, automotive dealers and 7 others, retreading tires and selling retread and other commercial tires through commercial outlets to end users and selling tires directly to consumers via the Internet. Terrys Tire operated ten distribution centers spanning from Virginia to Maine and in Ohio. We believe the acquisition of Terrys Tire will enhance our market position in these areas and aligns very well with our distribution centers, especially our new distribution centers that we opened over the past two years in the Northeast and Ohio. On January 31, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Hercules Tire Holdings LLC (Hercules Holdings) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated January 24, 2014. Hercules Holdings owns all of the capital stock of Hercules. Hercules is engaged in the business of purchasing, marketing, distributing and selling replacement tires for passenger cars, trucks and certain off-road vehicles to tire dealers, wholesale distributors, retail distributors and others in the United States, Canada and internationally. Hercules operated 15 distribution centers in the United States, six distribution centers in Canada and one warehouse in northern China. Hercules also markets the Hercules ® brand, which is one of the most sought-after proprietary tire brands in the industry. We believe the acquisition of Hercules will strengthen our presence in major markets such as California, Texas and Florida in addition to increasing our presence in Canada. Additionally, Hercules strong logistics and sourcing capabilities, including a long-standing presence in China, will also allow us to capitalize on the growing import market, as well as provide the ability to expand the international sales of the Hercules ® brand. Finally, this acquisition will allow us to be a brand marketer of the Hercules ® brand, which in 2013 had a 2% market share of the passenger and light truck market in North America and a 3% market share of highway truck tires in North America. On April 30, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Regional Tire Holdings, Inc. (RTD Holdco) pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated as of March 22, 2013, among TriCan Tire Distributors (TriCan), ATDI, RTD Holdco and Regional Tire Distributors Inc., a 100% owned subsidiary of RTD Holdco (RTD). RTD is a wholesale distributor of tires, tire parts, tire accessories and related equipment in the Ontario and Atlantic provinces of Canada. In addition, on June 16, 2014, we amended our credit agreement relating to our senior secured term loan facility to borrow an additional $340 million on the same terms as our existing Term Loan (as defined below). Pursuant to the amendment, until August 15, 2014, we also have the right to borrow up to an additional $80 million on the same terms as our existing Term Loan. The proceeds from these additional borrowings were or will be used to redeem all amounts outstanding under our Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) and pay related fees and expenses, as well as for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes, including the financing of potential future acquisitions. Risk Factors An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Any of the factors set forth under Risk Factors may limit our ability to successfully execute our business strategy. You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this prospectus and, in particular, should evaluate the specific factors set forth under Risk Factors in deciding whether to invest in our common stock. Among these important risks are the following:  Demand for tire products is lower when general economic conditions are weak and decreases in the availability of consumer credit or consumer spending could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.  We depend on manufacturers to provide us with the products we sell and disruptions in these relationships or manufacturers operations could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  The failure of our information technology systems could disrupt our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 8  Our business requires a significant amount of cash, and fluctuations in our cash flows may adversely affect our ability to fund our business or acquisitions or satisfy our debt obligations.  Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy.  The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and our failure to effectively compete may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  We face risks related to integration of our recent significant acquisitions.  We may not realize the growth opportunities and cost savings synergies that we anticipated from our recent significant acquisitions.  Pricing volatility for raw materials acquired by our suppliers could result in increased costs and may affect our profitability.  Attempts to expand our distribution services into new geographic markets may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  We regularly seek to grow our business through acquisitions, and our inability to identify desirable acquisition targets or integrate such acquisitions, including our recent significant acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on us.  Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity. For additional information about the risks we face, please see the section of this prospectus captioned Risk Factors. Our Sponsor TPG is a leading global private investment firm founded in 1992 with over $59 billion of assets under management as of March 31, 2014, and offices in San Francisco, Fort Worth, Austin, Beijing, Chongqing, Hong Kong, Houston, London, Luxembourg, Melbourne, Moscow, Mumbai, New York, Paris, São Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo.

The following chart shows our simplified organizational structure immediately following the consummation of this offering assuming no exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares: 10 The Offering Common stock offered by us shares Common stock offered by the selling stockholders shares Common stock to be outstanding after this offering shares (or shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full) Option to purchase additional shares The underwriters have an option for a period of 30 days to purchase up to additional shares of our common stock from us and the selling stockholders. Use of proceeds We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $ million, or approximately $ million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to: (i) repay a portion of our long-term indebtedness; and (ii) pay a $12.5 million termination fee to TPG under our transaction and monitoring fee letter. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds, if any, for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including supporting our strategic growth opportunities in the future. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. See Use of Proceeds. Dividend policy Our board of directors does not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock. However, we expect to reevaluate our dividend policy on a regular basis following the offering and may, subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness and other considerations, determine to pay dividends in the future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, which may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, the implications of the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and any other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.

Proposed symbol   Conflicts of Interest Affiliates of TPG Capital BD, LLC, an underwriter of this offering, own in excess of 10% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Therefore, a conflict of interest is deemed to exist under FINRA Rule 5121(f)(5)(B). In addition, because the TPG Funds (as defined below) are affiliates of TPG Capital BD, LLC and, as selling stockholders, will receive more than 5% of the net proceeds of this offering, a conflict of interest is also deemed to exist under Rule 5121(f)(5)(C)(ii) of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Accordingly, this offering will be made in compliance with the applicable provisions of FINRA Rule 5121. In accordance with FINRA Rule 5121(c), no sales of the shares will be made to any discretionary account over which TPG Capital BD, LLC exercises discretion without the prior specific written approval of the account holder. However, no qualified independent underwriter is required because the underwriters primarily responsible for managing this offering are free of any conflict of interest, as that term is defined in the rule. See Use of Proceeds and Underwriting (Conflicts of Interest). The number of shares of common stock to be outstanding after this offering is based on shares of common stock outstanding as of , 2014 (after giving effect to the one-for- reverse stock split effected on , 2014) and excludes the following:  shares reserved for future issuance in connection with the exercise of outstanding stock options at a weighted-average exercise price of $ per share; and  shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. Unless otherwise indicated, this prospectus reflects and assumes the following:  the adoption of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, to be effective upon the closing of this offering;  no exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to additional shares of our common stock in this offering; and  a one-for- reverse stock split of our common stock that became effective on , 2014. 12 Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Data The following table sets forth summary historical consolidated financial and other data for the periods indicated. The summary historical financial and other data as of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 and for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. The summary historical balance sheet data as of December 31, 2011 have been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of such date, which are not included in this prospectus. The summary historical financial and other data as of April 5, 2014 and for the first quarters of 2014 and 2013 have been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. The summary historical balance sheet data as of March 30, 2013 have been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements for such quarter, which are not included in this prospectus. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods, and operating results for the first quarter of 2014 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending January 3, 2015. The pro forma data for fiscal year 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 have been derived from our unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data included elsewhere in this prospectus. Our fiscal year is based on either a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to each December 31. Therefore, the financial results of 53-week fiscal years, and the associated 14-week quarter, will not be comparable to 52-week fiscal years, and the associated quarters having only 13 weeks. The 2011 fiscal year, which ended December 31, 2011, the 2012 fiscal year, which ended December 29, 2012, and the 2013 fiscal year, which ended December 28, 2013, each contain operating results for 52 weeks. The quarter ended April 5, 2014 contains operating results for 14 weeks while the quarter ended March 30, 2013 contains operating results for 13 weeks. It should be noted that the Companys recently acquired subsidiaries, Hercules and Terrys Tire, have different quarter-end reporting dates than that of the Company for the first quarter of 2014, with their quarters ending on March 31. Prior to the acquisitions, Hercules had an October 31 fiscal year end, Terrys Tire had a December 31 fiscal year end and RTD had a January 31 fiscal year end, but each such subsidiary changed its year end to be the same as that of the Company, effective as of their respective acquisition dates. It should also be noted that, prior to fiscal 2013, our year-end reporting date was different from that of our TriCan subsidiary. For fiscal 2012, TriCan had a calendar year-end reporting date. TriCan converted to our fiscal year-end reporting date during fiscal 2013. The impact from these differences on the consolidated financial statements was not material. This summary historical consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with the disclosures set forth under Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information, Capitalization, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. Due to our prior acquisitions and future acquisitions we may engage in, our historical operating results may be of limited use in evaluating our historical performance and predicting future results. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to our Business and IndustryBecause of our prior acquisitions and future acquisitions we may engage in, our historical operating results may be of limited use in evaluating our historical performance and predicting our future results. 13 Dollars in thousands (except for per share data) First Quarter 2014 (1) First Quarter 2013 Fiscal Year 2013 (2) Fiscal Year 2012 (3) Fiscal Year 2011 (4) Statement of Operations Data: Net sales $ 1,075,469 $ 839,978 $ 3,839,269 $ 3,455,864 $ 3,050,240 Cost of goods sold, excluding depreciation included in selling, general and administrative expenses below 917,314 708,156 3,188,409 2,887,421 2,535,020 Selling, general and administrative expenses 177,918 136,504 574,987 506,558 437,260 Transaction expenses 4,686 1,023 6,719 5,246 3,946 Operating income (loss) (24,449 ) (5,705 ) 69,154 56,639 74,014 Other income (expense): Interest expense (24,399 ) (17,240 ) (74,316 ) (72,910 ) (67,572 ) Other, net (5) (1,802 ) (973 ) (5,196 ) (3,895 ) (2,110 ) Income (loss) from operations before income taxes (50,650 ) (23,918 ) (10,358 ) (20,166 ) 4,332 Income tax provision (benefit) (16,606 ) (7,627 ) (3,982 ) (5,965 ) 4,464 Net income (loss) $ (34,044 ) $ (16,291 ) $ (6,376 ) $ (14,201 ) $ (132 ) Basic net income (loss) per common share (6) $ (0.05 ) $ (0.02 ) $ (0.01 ) $ (0.02 ) $ (0.00 ) Diluted net income (loss) per share (6) $ (0.05 ) $ (0.02 ) $ (0.01 ) $ (0.02 ) $ (0.00 ) Weighted average shares outstanding (6) Basic 756,390,625 734,168,402 734,168,402 688,300,235 684,172,402 Diluted 756,390,625 734,168,402 734,168,402 688,300,235 684,172,402 Other Financial Data: Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities $ (72,625 ) $ 2,132 $ 100,982 $ 10,072 $ (90,699 ) Investing activities (689,243 ) (16,697 ) (118,435 ) (167,821 ) (92,249 ) Financing activities 765,613 4,210 22,998 168,824 186,263 Depreciation and amortization 29,323 25,031 105,458 89,167 78,071 Capital expenditures 14,402 11,873 47,127 52,388 31,044 EBITDA (7) 3,072 18,353 169,416 141,911 149,975 Adjusted EBITDA (7) 29,010 23,911 195,486 165,416 164,255 Balance Sheet Data: Cash and cash equivalents $ 37,824 $ 23,832 $ 35,760 $ 34,700 $ 23,682 Working capital (8) 799,264 558,179 541,051 556,646 457,443 Total assets 3,520,902 2,453,692 2,541,655 2,486,837 2,285,364 Total debt (9) 1,710,106 964,262 967,000 951,204 835,808 Total stockholders equity 691,348 675,386 680,054 692,753 642,773 First Quarter 2014 Fiscal Year 2013 Pro Forma Data: Pro forma net sales $ 1,219,939 $ 4,954,939 Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA (10) 31,337 231,811 Pro forma net income (loss) (52,938 ) (55,200 ) (1) Reflects the acquisition of Terrys Tire in March 2014 and the acquisition of Hercules and Kipling Tire Co.

(6) Does not reflect the one-for reverse stock split effected on , 2014. (7) EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted to reflect the items set forth in the table below. The presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our GAAP results and the following reconciliation, we believe provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. We also believe that such measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies similar to ours. Our board of directors, management and investors use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Our board of directors also uses Adjusted EBITDA in determining compensation for our management. The adjustments from EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA include management and advisory fees paid to our Sponsor, non-cash stock compensation expense, transaction expenses related to our acquisitions, non-cash amortization of inventory step-up resulting from the business combination rules for our acquisitions and other items, including franchise and other taxes, non-cash gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets and assets held for sale, exchange gains and losses on foreign currency, and non-cash impairment of long-lived assets. Amounts presented in accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers because not all issuers calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments set forth below. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of each of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), determined in accordance with GAAP: In thousands First Quarter 2014 First Quarter 2013 Fiscal Year 2013 Fiscal Year 2012 Fiscal Year 2011 Net income (loss) $ (34,044 ) $ (16,291 ) $ (6,376 ) $ (14,201 ) $ (132 ) Depreciation and amortization 29,323 25,031 105,458 89,167 78,071 Interest expense 24,399 17,240 74,316 72,910 67,572 Income tax provision (benefit) (16,606 ) (7,627 ) (3,982 ) (5,965 ) 4,464 EBITDA $ 3,072 $ 18,353 $ 169,416 $ 141,911 $ 149,975 Management fee 608 991 5,753 7,446 4,624 Non-cash stock compensation 567 668 2,634 4,349 4,114 Transaction fees 4,686 1,023 6,719 5,246 3,946 Non-cash inventory step-up 19,183 2,194 5,379 4,074  Other (A) 894 682 5,585 2,390 1,596 Adjusted EBITDA $ 29,010 $ 23,911 $ 195,486 $ 165,416 $ 164,255 15 (A) Other includes non-income based taxes, impairment, gain/loss on property and equipment disposals, deferred compensation and foreign currency exchange gains/losses. (8) Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. (9) Total debt is the sum of current maturities of long-term debt, non-current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations. (10) Pro forma EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We present pro forma EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, in addition to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, to provide a more complete understanding of our results of operations that gives effect to the recent significant acquisitions that we have completed. These amounts have similar limitations to the limitations described in footnote (7) regarding EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, the pro forma financial information we present is based on estimates and assumptions regarding our recent acquisitions that may end up being materially different from our actual experience. Neither pro forma EBITDA nor pro forma Adjusted EBITDA should be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP or pro forma net income (loss). Moreover, our debt agreements use a measure similar to pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to measure compliance with certain covenants except that, under certain of these debt agreements, the calculation of the measure allows us (subject to certain limitations) to take into account the amount of cost savings and synergies projected in good faith to be realized in the future in connection with cost saving restructuring initiatives as though those cost savings had already been realized in past periods. We have not included such projected cost savings or synergies in our presentation of pro forma Adjusted EBITDA in this prospectus. Therefore, the amount calculated pursuant to our debt agreements may be higher than pro forma Adjusted EBITDA as set forth in this prospectus. For further discussion of our cost savings initiatives, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of each of pro forma EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma net income (loss): First Quarter Fiscal Year In thousands 2014 2013 Pro forma net income (loss) $ (52,938 ) $ (55,200 ) Depreciation and amortization 40,178 157,464 Interest expense 32,520 128,118 Income tax provision (benefit) (11,563 ) (35,266 ) Pro forma EBITDA $ 8,197 $ 195,116 Management fee 855 7,353 Non-cash stock compensation 567 5,222 Transaction fees 1,708 7,764 Non-cash inventory step-up 19,183 5,379 Other (A) 827 10,977 Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA $ 31,337 $ 231,811 (A) Other includes non-income based taxes, impairment, gain/loss on property and equipment disposals, deferred compensation and foreign currency exchange gains/losses.

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information contained in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this prospectus, before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could suffer materially, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to our Business and Industry Demand for tire products is lower when general economic conditions are weak and decreases in the availability of consumer credit or consumer spending could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. The popularity, supply and demand for tire products changes from year to year based on consumer confidence, the volume of tires reaching the replacement tire market and the level of personal discretionary income, among other factors. Decreases in the availability of consumer credit or decreases in consumer spending as a result of recent economic conditions, including increased unemployment and rising fuel prices, may cause consumers to delay tire purchases, reduce spending on tires or purchase less expensive tires. These changes in consumer behavior could reduce the number of tires we sell, reduce our net sales or cause a change in our product mix toward products with lower per-tire margins, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. Local economic, employment, weather, transportation and other conditions also affect tire sales, on both a wholesale and retail basis. We cannot, as a result of these factors and others, assure you that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flows to finance or grow our business or that our cash needs will not increase. Historically, we have experienced that rising fuel costs, higher unemployment and credit tightening cause a decrease in miles driven and consumer spending, both of which we believe cause a decrease in unit sales in the U.S. and Canadian replacement tire industries. Our business is adversely affected as a result of such industry-wide events and we may be adversely affected by similar events in the future. We depend on manufacturers to provide us with the products we sell and disruptions in these relationships or manufacturers operations could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. There are a limited number of tire manufacturers worldwide. Accordingly, we rely on a limited number of tire manufacturers to supply us with the products we sell, including flag and associate brands and our proprietary brands. Our business depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with these manufacturers. Outside of our proprietary brands, we do not have long-term contracts with these manufacturers, and we cannot assure you that these manufacturers will continue to supply products to us on favorable terms or at all. Many of our manufacturers are free to terminate their business relationship with us with little or no notice and may elect to do so for any reason or no reason. We believe that part of our value proposition is our ability to distribute the broadest product offering in our industry. As a result, if one or more of our manufacturers were to discontinue business with us, our business could be adversely affected by the negative impact on our reputation and ability to continue to deliver on this value proposition, as well as any decrease in net sales. Further, certain of our key suppliers also compete with us as they distribute and sell tires to certain of our tire retailer customers. A move towards this business model among our manufacturers could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to make selective acquisitions, but manufacturers may not be willing to supply the companies we acquire, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we could be adversely affected if any significant manufacturer experiences financial, operational, production, supply, labor, regulatory or quality assurance difficulties that result in a reduction or interruption in our supply, or if they otherwise fail to meet our needs. These risks have 17 been more pronounced recently in light of commodity price volatility and governmental actions. In addition, our failure to order or promptly pay for sufficient quantities of our products may result in an increase in the unit cost of the products we purchase, a reduction in cooperative advertising and marketing funds, or a manufacturers unwillingness or refusal to sell products to us. If we are required to replace one or more of our manufacturers, we could experience cost increases, time delays in deliveries and a loss of customers, any of which would adversely affect us. Finally, although most newly manufactured tires are sold in the replacement tire market, manufacturers pay disproportionate attention to automobile manufacturers that purchase tires for new cars. Increased demand from automobile manufacturers could result in cost increases and time delays in deliveries to us, either of which could adversely affect us. The failure of our information technology systems could disrupt our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. The failure of our information technology systems, including our Oracle ERP platform, to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business substantially and could result in, among other things, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of data and the loss of sales and customers, all of which could cause our business and results of operations to suffer. While we have made significant investments in our disaster recovery strategies and infrastructure, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including, without limitation, fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failure, system conversions, security breaches, cyber-attacks, viruses and/or human error. In any such event, we could be required to make a significant investment to fix or replace information technology systems, and we could experience interruptions in our ability to service our customers. Additionally, we and our customers could suffer financial and reputational harm if customer or Company proprietary information was compromised by a security breach or cyber-attack. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business requires a significant amount of cash, and fluctuations in our cash flows may adversely affect our ability to fund our business or acquisitions or satisfy our debt obligations. Our ability to fund working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and acquisitions and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations depend on our ability to generate cash flows, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet these needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, obtain additional financing or reduce expenditures that we deem necessary to our business. Further, our ability to grow our business and market share through acquisitions may be impaired. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain refinancing of this kind on favorable terms or at all or that any additional financing could be obtained. The inability to obtain additional financing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and cash flows. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our credit facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to 18 meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our debt service obligations. As of April 5, 2014, on a pro forma as adjusted basis after giving effect to this offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom, we would have had total indebtedness of approximately $ , and our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. We have a substantial amount of debt, which requires significant interest and principal payments. As of April 5, 2014, on a pro forma as adjusted basis after giving effect to this offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom, at an assumed public offering price per share of $ , the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover of the prospectus, we would have had total indebtedness of approximately $ . Subject to the restrictions contained in our ABL Facility, our Term Loan, the indenture governing our Senior Subordinated Notes, and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. These restrictions will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness, may be waived by certain votes of debt holders and, if we refinance our existing indebtedness, such refinancing indebtedness may contain fewer restrictions on our activities. To the extent new indebtedness or other financial obligations are added to our and our subsidiaries currently anticipated indebtedness levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries face could intensify. Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and increase the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness, combined with our other existing and any future financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have important consequences. For example, it could:  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, selling and marketing efforts, research and development and other purposes;  increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less indebtedness;  increase our cost of borrowing and cause us to incur substantial fees from time to time in connection with debt amendments or refinancings;  increase our exposure to rising interest rates because a portion of our borrowings is at variable interest rates;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; and  limit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, selling and marketing efforts, research and development and other corporate purposes. For additional risks relating to our substantial indebtedness, see Restrictions imposed by our outstanding indebtedness, including the indenture governing our outstanding notes, may limit our ability to operate our business and to finance our future operation or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. 19 The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and our failure to effectively compete may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. In North America, replacement tires are sold to consumers through several different retail channels, including local independent tire retailers and mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, tire manufacturer-owned stores, automotive dealerships and web-based marketers. A number of independent wholesale tire distributors compete with us for the business of tire retailers in the regions in which we do business. Most of our tire retailer customers buy products from both us and our competitors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets in the future. We would also be adversely affected if certain channels in the replacement tire retail market, including mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs, were to gain market share at the expense of the local independent tire retailers, as our market share in those channels is lower. See BusinessCompetition. We face risks related to the integration of our recent significant acquisitions. The acquisitions of Hercules and Terrys Tire constitute significant acquisitions for our business. Our management will be required to devote a significant amount of time and attention to the process of integrating the businesses and operations of Hercules and Terrys Tire with our business and operations, which may decrease the time management will have to serve existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products, services or strategies, and could adversely affect the performance of the combined company. The size and complexity of both acquired businesses, if not managed successfully by our management, may result in interruptions in our business activities, inconsistencies in our operations, standards, controls, procedures and policies, a decrease in the quality of our services and products, a deterioration in our employee and customer relationships, increased costs of integration and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not realize the growth opportunities and cost savings synergies that are anticipated from our recent significant acquisitions. The benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the recent acquisitions of Hercules and Terrys Tire will depend in part on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities and cost savings synergies. Our success in realizing these opportunities and synergies and the timing of this realization depend on the successful integration of the businesses and operations of Hercules and Terrys Tire with our business and operations and the adoption of our respective best practices. Even if we are able to integrate these businesses and operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and synergies we currently expect from this integration within the anticipated time frame or at all. While we anticipate that substantial expenses will be incurred in connection with the integration of Hercules and Terrys Tire, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately, and may significantly exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from these acquisitions may be offset by unanticipated costs or delays in integrating the companies. Pricing volatility for raw materials acquired by our suppliers could result in increased costs and may affect our profitability. Costs for certain raw materials used in manufacturing the products we sell, including natural rubber, chemicals, steel reinforcements, carbon black, synthetic rubber and other petroleum-based products, are volatile. Increasing costs for raw materials supplies would result in increased production costs for tire manufacturers. Tire manufacturers typically pass along a portion of their increased costs to us through price increases. While we typically try to pass increased prices and fuel costs through to tire retailers or modify our activities to mitigate the impact of higher prices, we may not be successful. Failure to fully pass these increased prices and costs through to tire retailers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would adversely affect our operating margins and results of operations. Further, even if we do successfully pass along these costs, demand for tires may decline as a result of the increased costs, which would adversely affect us. 20 Attempts to expand our distribution services into new geographic markets may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We plan to expand our distribution services into new geographic markets in North America, which will require us to make capital investments to extend and develop our distribution infrastructure. We may not achieve profitability in new regions for a period of time. If we do not successfully add new distribution centers and routes, we experience unanticipated costs or delays or we experience competition in such markets that is greater than we expect, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected. We regularly seek to grow our business through acquisitions, and our inability to identify desirable acquisition targets or integrate such acquisitions, including our recent significant acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on us. We regularly investigate and acquire strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to be accretive to earnings, increase our market penetration, strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offering. In executing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for such acquisitions. Pursuing growth by way of these types of transactions involves significant challenges and risks, including the inability to successfully identify suitable acquisition targets on terms acceptable to us, advance our business strategy, realize a satisfactory return on investment, successfully integrate business activities or resources, or retain key personnel, customers and suppliers. A failure to identify and acquire desirable acquisition targets may slow growth in our annual unit volume, which could adversely affect our existing business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if we are unable to manage acquisitions or investments, successfully complete transactions or effectively integrate acquired businesses, such as Hercules or Terrys Tire, we may not realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated from the transaction relative to the consideration paid in the anticipated time frame or at all, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Further, we may be unsuccessful in identifying and evaluating business, legal or financial risks as part of the due diligence process associated with a particular transaction, and could be held liable for environmental, tax or other risks and liabilities of the acquired business. In addition, some investments may result in the incurrence of debt or may have contingent consideration components that may require us to pay additional amounts in the future in relation to future performance results of the subject business. We may also experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury, management and financial reporting as a result of such transactions. These factors could divert attention from our business and otherwise harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity. A number of our recent acquisitions have been financed primarily through the incurrence of additional debt, either through increases in availability under our ABL Facility, the issuance of additional subordinated notes or through term loans. We have also financed some recent acquisitions by selling additional equity to TPG and certain co-investors. If we were to undertake another substantial acquisition, the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through further amendments to our ABL Facility, additional financing from banks, public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements. We cannot assure you that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required, particularly because we are currently highly leveraged, which may make it difficult or impossible for us to secure financing for acquisitions. If we were to undertake an acquisition by issuing equity securities or equity-linked securities, the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock. If we were to undertake an acquisition by incurring additional debt, the risks associated with our already substantial level of indebtedness could intensify. 21 Our business strategy relies increasingly upon online commerce. If our customers were unable to access any of our websites, such as ATDOnline ® , our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results would be adversely affected. Customers access to our websites directly affects the volume of orders we fulfill and our revenues in the United States. Approximately 65% of our U.S. total order volume in fiscal 2013 was placed online using ATDOnline ® , up from approximately 56% in fiscal 2007. We expect our Internet-generated business in the United States to continue to grow as a percentage of overall sales. To be successful, we must ensure that ATDOnline ® is well supported and functional on a 24/7 basis. If we are not able to continuously make these ordering tools available to our customers, there could be a decline in online orders and a decrease in our net sales. We may not successfully execute our plan to grow our TireBuyer.com ® service or we may not attain the growth we expect from our TireBuyer.com ® service. We continue to invest in TireBuyer.com ® , an Internet site which enables our independent tire retailer customers to access the online tire consumer market and sell to consumers over the Internet. In 2012, the TireBuyer.com ® site was re-launched on a platform that is faster and more flexible in allowing us to respond to the needs of our customers and enhancing the overall consumer experience. Since its initial launch in 2009, we have generally seen a consistent increase in consumer traffic on the site. We expect that by growing and developing our TireBuyer.com ® service, we can leverage our tire retailer customer footprint to capture a greater share of the Internet tire market. For TireBuyer.com ® to be successful, however, we must ensure that it is well supported and functional on a 24/7 basis. In addition, TireBuyer.com ® faces significant competition from other online participants, some of which have significantly larger Internet market share, longer Internet market presence, greater Internet marketing experience and better name recognition than we enjoy. We may fail to successfully grow, develop or support the TireBuyer.com ® service or we may not attain the growth or benefits we expect TireBuyer.com ® to provide us due to strong competition or other factors, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Because the majority of our inventory is stored in our warehouse distribution centers, a disruption in our warehouse distribution centers could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our cost and distribution lead times. We maintain the majority of our inventory in our more than 140 distribution centers in North America. Serious disruptions affecting these distribution centers or the flow of products in or out of these centers, including disruptions from inclement weather, fire, earthquakes or other causes, could damage a significant portion of our inventory and could adversely affect our ability to distribute our products to tire retailers in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost. During the time that it may take us to reopen or replace a distribution center, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to tire retailers, which could adversely affect our reputation, as well as our results of operations and our customer relationships. If we experience problems with our fleet of trucks or are otherwise unable to make timely deliveries of our products to our customers, our business and reputation could be adversely affected. We use a fleet of trucks to deliver our products to our customers, most of which are leased from third parties. We are subject to the risks associated with product delivery, including inclement weather, disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, disruptions in our lease arrangements, availability and price of fuel, liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases. Our failure to deliver tires and other products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand, which could adversely affect our business and reputation. 22 Our Hercules ® brand tires are generally manufactured in various countries in Asia and as a result are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the United States and Canada. Following our acquisition of Hercules, we distribute a private brand tire marketed under the Hercules ® brand. These tires are generally manufactured in various countries in Asia. There are a number of risks in doing business abroad, including political and economic uncertainty, social unrest, sudden changes in laws and regulations, shortages of trained labor, transportation risks and the uncertainties associated with doing business in foreign countries. These risks may impact our ability to expand our outsourced manufacturing operations and otherwise achieve our objectives relating to private brand marketing, including capitalizing on the expanding import market. In addition, compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, import and export limitations, anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and exchange controls is burdensome and expensive. Our foreign operations also subject us to the risks of international terrorism and hostilities and to foreign currency risks, including exchange rate fluctuations and limits on the repatriation of funds. Our exposure to the credit risks of our customers may make it difficult to collect accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In the course of our sales to customers, we may encounter difficulty collecting accounts receivable and could be exposed to risks associated with uncollectible accounts receivable. Economic conditions may impact some of our customers ability to pay their accounts payable. While we attempt to monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to collect accounts receivable balances, we have written down accounts receivable and written off doubtful accounts in prior periods and may be unable to avoid accounts receivable write-downs or write-offs of doubtful accounts in the future. Such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and could harm our operating results. Consolidation among customers may reduce our importance as a holder of sizable inventory, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our success has been dependent, in part, on the fragmented customer base in our industry. Due to the small size of most tire retailers, they cannot support substantial inventory positions and thus, as our size permits us to maintain a sizable inventory, we fill an important role. However, we do not generally have long-term arrangements with our tire retailer customers and they can cease doing business with us at any time. If a trend towards consolidation among tire retailers develops in the future, it could reduce our importance and reduce our revenues, margins and earnings. While the local independent tire retailer share of the replacement tire market has been relatively stable in the recent past, the share of larger tire retailers has grown at the expense of smaller tire retailers. If that trend continues, the number of tire retailers able to handle sizable inventory could increase, reducing the importance of distributors like us to the local independent tire retailer market. Participants in our Tire Pros ® franchise program are independent operators and we have limited influence over their operations. Our Tire Pros ® franchisees could take actions that could harm the value of the Tire Pros ® franchise, or could be unwilling or unable to continue to participate in the program, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Participants in our Tire Pros ® franchise program are independent operators and have significant discretion in running their operations. Their employees are not our employees. Franchisees could take actions that subject them to legal and financial liabilities, and we may, regardless of the actual validity of such a claim, be named as a party in an action relating to, or be held liable for, the conduct of our franchisees if it is shown that we exercise a sufficient level of control over a particular franchisees operation. In addition, the quality of franchise operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. We do not offer financial or management services to our franchisees, which may not have sufficient resources or expertise to operate their businesses at the level we would expect. While we ultimately can take action to terminate franchisees that do not comply with the standards contained in our franchise agreements, we may not be able to identify problems and take action quickly enough and, as a result, the image and reputation of Tire Pros ® may suffer, fewer tire retailers may become Tire Pros ® franchisees and existing participants may leave the Tire Pros ® program. 23 In addition, our franchise agreements have limited durations and our franchisees may not be willing or able to renew their franchise agreements with us. For example, a franchisee may decide not to renew due to a lawsuit or disagreement with us, dissatisfaction with the Tire Pros ® program or a perception that the Tire Pros ® program conflicts with other business interests. Similarly, a franchisee may be unable to renew its franchise agreement with us due to a bankruptcy or restructuring event or the failure to secure a real estate lease renewal, among other factors. Our business, business prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if we are forced to defend claims made against our franchisees, if others seek to hold us accountable for our franchisees actions, if the Tire Pros ® program does not grow as we expect or if the Tire Pros ® franchise program is not otherwise successful. We could become subject to additional government regulation which could cause us to incur significant liabilities. We are currently subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our business, including laws and regulations that affect tire distribution and sale, safety matters and tire specifications. Our costs of complying with these laws and regulations, including our operating expenses and liabilities arising under governmental regulations, may be increased in the future, including due to expansion of our business into new geographic areas, and additional fees and taxes may be imposed by governmental authorities. Future regulatory requirements, such as required disclosure of made-on dates for tires or an expansion of the Transportation Recall Enhancement Accountability and Documentation (TREAD) Act to cover tire distributors, could cause a material increase in our liabilities or operating expenses, which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Loss of key personnel or failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We are dependent on the continued services of our senior management team. We may not be able to retain our existing senior management, fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover, or attract additional senior management personnel. We believe the loss of such key personnel could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, our ability to manage our anticipated growth will depend on our ability to identify, hire and retain qualified management personnel. We cannot assure you that we will attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to meet our business needs. We could be subject to product liability, personal injury or other litigation claims that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Purchasers of our products, or their employees or customers, could be injured or suffer property damage from exposure to, or defects in, products we sell or distribute, or have sold or distributed in the past. We could be subject to claims, including personal injury claims. These claims may not be covered by insurance or tire manufacturers may be unwilling or unable to assume the defense of these claims, as they have in the past. In addition, if any tire manufacturer encounters financial difficulty or ceases to operate, it may not be able to assume the defense of such claims. In addition, we now own the Hercules ® tire brand and therefore could be liable for these claims in the future in connection with the manufacture and sale of the Hercules ® brand tires. We also may be subject to claims due to injuries caused by our truck drivers which may not be covered by insurance. As a result, the defense, settlement or successful assertion of any future product liability, personal injury or other litigation claims could cause us to incur significant costs and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could incur costs to comply with environmental regulations and to address liabilities relating to environmental matters, particularly those relating to our distribution centers. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Compliance costs associated with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, particularly 24 as they relate to our distribution centers, as well as liabilities, including fines, claims or clean-up costs, arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), we provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including managements assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Changes to our business and the integration of newly-acquired businesses will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes, including to address any internal control issues of the businesses that we acquire from time to time. For example, the Terrys Tire auditors identified material weaknesses, which were in existence at the time we acquired the business, relating to security administration and access to systems, separation of duties, and external financial reporting. We are in the process of integrating the Terrys Tire business, including placing them on our information technology and accounting systems, as well as implementing our own internal controls and procedures with respect to the Terrys Tire business. While we do not expect the issues identified by the Terrys Tire auditors to continue following the completion of the integration, which we anticipate will be completed during the third quarter of 2014, we face risks like this in the ordinary course of business. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, including any required new or improved controls, we may be unable to provide financial information in a timely and reliable manner and might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the SEC or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results or investors confidence in us or in the integrity of our financial statements and public filings and could cause the price of our securities to fall. If we determine that our goodwill and other intangible assets have become impaired, we may record significant impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets. Goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. In the future, goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of future acquisitions. We review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses, adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of an acquired business. Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under our ABL Facility, FILO Facility and Term Loan are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results. The financial position and results of operations for TriCan, our 100% owned subsidiary acquired during 2012, was initially recorded in its functional currency which is the Canadian dollar. Because our consolidated 25 financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the weighted-average exchange rate prevailing during the year and assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rate. Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar will have an impact on the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if its value has not changed in its original currency. Restrictions imposed by our outstanding indebtedness, including the indenture governing our outstanding notes, may limit our ability to operate our business and to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. The terms of our outstanding indebtedness restrict us from engaging in specified types of transactions. These covenants restrict our ability, among other things, to:  incur indebtedness or guarantees or engage in sale-leaseback transactions;  incur liens;  engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales;  alter the business conducted by ATDI and its restricted subsidiaries;  make investments and loans;  declare dividends or other distributions;  enter into agreements limiting restricted subsidiary distributions; and  engage in certain transactions with affiliates. In addition, the credit agreement for our ABL Facility requires us to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio test if certain conditions are triggered. Our ability to comply with this financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy it. Additionally, the restrictions contained in the indenture governing our outstanding notes could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. See Description of Indebtedness. The terms of any future indebtedness we incur could include more restrictive covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facilities or the indenture governing our outstanding notes, which could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of or default under any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results. In the event of any default under our credit facilities, the applicable lenders could elect to terminate borrowing commitments and declare all borrowings and loans outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and other obligations, to be due and payable. In addition, or in the alternative, the applicable lenders could exercise their rights under the security documents entered into in connection with our credit facilities. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our credit facilities. If we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings and loans when due, the applicable lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event the applicable lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of amounts due under the agreements governing our credit facilities or the exercise by the applicable lenders of their rights under the security documents would likely have a material adverse effect on us. 26 Because of our prior acquisitions and future acquisitions we may engage in, our historical operating results may be of limited use in evaluating our historical performance and predicting our future results. We have acquired a number of businesses in recent years, including TriCan, RTD, Hercules and Terrys Tire, and we expect that we will engage in acquisitions of other businesses from time to time in the future. The operating results of the acquired businesses are included in our financial statements included in this prospectus only from the date of the completion of such acquisitions. All of our acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Use of this method has resulted in a new valuation of the assets and liabilities of the acquired companies. As a result of these acquisitions and any future acquisitions, our historical operating results may be of limited use in evaluating our historical performance and predicting our future results. In addition, other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of these acquisitions and any future acquisitions. The pro forma financial information in this prospectus is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what the financial position or results of operations of the Company would have been had the applicable acquisitions and other transactions been completed on the dates assumed for purposes of that pro forma information nor does it represent the actual financial position or results of operations of the Company following such transactions. The pro forma financial information in this prospectus is derived from the respective historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company, Terrys Tire, Hercules and RTD included in this prospectus. It is presented for illustrative purposes only and contains certain estimates and assumptions about the acquisitions and other transactions described therein. The preparation of this pro forma financial information is based on certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable. Our assumptions may prove to be inaccurate over time and may be affected by other factors. Accordingly, the pro forma financial information may not reflect what our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows would have been had the applicable transactions occurred during the periods presented or what our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows will be in the future. In addition, for purposes of the pro forma financial information, the consideration for the relevant acquisitions has been preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the preliminary valuations. The final allocation is dependent upon third-party valuations and other studies that have not been completed. The final allocation could vary materially from the preliminary allocation used in the financial information contained in this prospectus. Additionally, the pro forma financial information does not give effect to any unforeseen costs that could result from the relevant acquisitions, nor does it include any other items not expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results of operations. Risks Related to our Common Stock and this Offering TPG will continue to have significant influence over us after this offering, including control over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for a vote. We are currently controlled, and after this offering is completed will continue to be controlled, by TPG. Upon completion of this offering, investment funds affiliated with TPG will beneficially own % of our outstanding common stock (or % if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares). As long as TPG owns or controls at least a majority of our outstanding voting power, it will have the ability to exercise substantial control over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our board, any amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets. Even if its ownership falls below 50%, TPG will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. 27 Additionally, TPGs interests may not align with the interests of our other stockholders. TPG is in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. TPG may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Upon the listing of our shares, we will be a controlled company within the meaning of the rules of and, as a result, will qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements; you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements. Because TPG will continue to control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock after completion of this offering, we will be a controlled company within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of . Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that, within one year of the date of the listing of our common stock:  we have a board that is composed of a majority of independent directors, as defined under the rules of ;  we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and  we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors. Following this offering, we intend to utilize all of these exemptions. Accordingly, in the event TPGs interests differ from those of other stockholders, and, for so long as we are a controlled company, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of . Our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price. Our directors who have relationships with TPG may have conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving our company. Following this offering, of our directors will be affiliated with TPG. Our TPG-affiliated directors have fiduciary duties to us and, in addition, will have duties to TPG. As a result, these directors may face real or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting both us and TPG, whose interests, in some circumstances, may be adverse to ours. Provisions of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders. In addition to TPGs beneficial ownership of a controlling percentage of our common stock, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL) contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval that could be used to dilute a potential hostile acquiror. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board. Because our board is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace current members of our management team. As a result, you may lose your ability to sell your stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures, and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or management of the Company may be unsuccessful. See Description of Capital Stock. 28 If you purchase shares of common stock in this offering, you will suffer immediate and substantial dilution of your investment. The initial public offering price of our common stock is substantially higher than the net tangible book deficit per share of our common stock. Therefore, if you purchase shares of our common stock in this offering, you will pay a price per share that substantially exceeds our net tangible book deficit per share after this offering. Based on an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, you will experience immediate dilution of $ per share, representing the difference between our pro forma net tangible book deficit per share after giving effect to this offering and the initial public offering price. In addition, purchasers of common stock in this offering will have contributed % of the aggregate price paid by all purchasers of our stock but will own only approximately % of our common stock outstanding after this offering. We also have a large number of outstanding stock options to purchase common stock with exercise prices that are below the estimated initial public offering price of our common stock. To the extent that these options are exercised, you will experience further dilution. See Dilution for more detail. Your percentage ownership in us may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, our board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of options, or shares of our authorized but unissued preferred stock. Issuances of common stock or voting preferred stock would reduce your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, would likely result in your interest in us being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock. An active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not develop, which may limit your ability to sell your shares. Prior to this offering, there was no public market for our common stock. Although we intend to list our common stock on under the symbol  , an active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained following this offering. The initial public offering price will be determined by negotiations between us and the underwriters and may not be indicative of market prices of our common stock that will prevail in the open market after the offering. A public trading market having the desirable characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the existence of willing buyers and sellers at any given time, such existence being dependent upon the individual decisions of buyers and sellers over which neither we nor any market maker has control. The failure of an active and liquid trading market to develop and continue would likely have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock. The market price of our common stock may decline below the initial public offering price, and you may not be able to sell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid in this offering, or at all. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration. As a public company, we will become subject to additional laws, regulations and stock exchange listing standards, which will impose additional costs on us and may strain our resources and divert our managements attention. Prior to this offering, although Holdings has filed periodic and current reports with the SEC to satisfy obligations under our debt instruments, we operated our company on a private basis. After this offering, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of , and other applicable securities laws and regulations. Compliance with these 29 laws and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly. In particular, we estimate that we will incur incremental costs in connection with the requirements to obtain an attestation report on our internal controls from our independent auditors under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In connection with preparation for providing this attestation, our independent auditors may identify deficiencies or weaknesses in our controls. We also expect that being a public company and being subject to new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. We estimate that we will incur between $ million and $ million annually in expenses related to incremental insurance costs and other expenses associated with being a public company, including listing, printer, audit and XBRL fees and investor relations costs. However, the incremental costs that we incur as a result of becoming a public company could exceed our estimate. These factors may therefore strain our resources, divert managements attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members. Our operating results and share price may be volatile, and the market price of our common stock after this offering may drop below the price you pay. Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future as a publicly traded company. In addition, securities markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance. We and the underwriters will negotiate to determine the initial public offering price. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the initial public offering price or at all. Our operating results and the trading price of our shares may fluctuate in response to various factors, including:  market conditions in the broader stock market;  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;  introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;  issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations;  results of operations that vary from expectations of securities analysis and investors;  guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;  strategic actions by us or our competitors;  announcement by us, our competitors or our vendors of significant contracts or acquisitions;  sales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our stock;  additions or departures of key personnel;  regulatory, legal or political developments;  public response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;  litigation and governmental investigations;  changing economic conditions;  changes in accounting principles; 30  default under agreements governing our indebtedness;  exchange rate fluctuations; and  other events or factors, including those from natural disasters, war, actors of terrorism or responses to these events. These and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause our operating results and the market price and demand for our shares to fluctuate substantially. While we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation. A significant portion of our total outstanding shares are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. After this offering, we will have outstanding shares of common stock based on the number of shares outstanding as of , 2014. This includes shares that we are selling in this offering, as well as the shares that the selling stockholders are selling, which may be resold in the public market immediately, and assumes no exercises of outstanding options. Substantially all of the shares that are not being sold in this offering will be subject to a 180-day lock-up period provided under agreements executed in connection with this offering. These shares will, however, be able to be resold after the expiration of the lock-up agreement as described in the Shares Eligible for Future Sale section of this prospectus. We also intend to file a Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), to register all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. In addition, TPG has certain demand registration rights that could require us in the future to file registration statements in connection with sales of our stock by TPG. See Certain Relationships and Related Party TransactionsRegistration Rights Agreement. Such sales by TPG could be significant. Once we register these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to the lock-up agreements described in the Underwriting section of this prospectus. As restrictions on resale end, the market price of our stock could decline if the holders of currently restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. Since we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock following this offering, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. Although we have previously declared dividends to our stockholders, we do not anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our common stock following this offering. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is, and may be, limited by covenants of existing and any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. Therefore, any return on investment in our common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our common stock on the open market, which may not occur. See Dividend Policy for more detail. 31 We are a holding company with nominal net worth and will depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to pay any dividends. ATD Corporation is a holding company with nominal net worth. We do not have any material assets or conduct any business operations other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Our business operations are conducted primarily out of our indirect operating subsidiary, ATDI and its subsidiaries. As a result, notwithstanding any restrictions on payment of dividends under our existing indebtedness, our ability to pay dividends, if any, will be dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries, including from ATDI. Payments to us by our subsidiaries will be contingent upon their respective earnings and subject to any limitations on the ability of such entities to make payments or other distributions to us. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our shares or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our share price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our shares will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our share price could decline. A ratings downgrade or other negative action by a ratings organization could adversely affect the trading price of the shares of our common stock. Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow. The condition of the financial and credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. In addition, developments in our business and operations could lead to a ratings downgrade for us or our subsidiaries. Any such fluctuation in the rating of us or our subsidiaries may impact our ability to access debt markets in the future or increase our cost of future debt which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition, which in return may adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. Our certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. 32 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, and other future conditions. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipate, believe, envision, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, project, target, potential, will, would, could, should, continue, contemplate and other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding:  plans for future growth and other business development activities;  plans for capital expenditures;  expectations for market and industry growth and trends;  financing sources;  dividends;  the effects of regulation and competition;  synergies and cost savings related to acquisitions;  foreign currency conversion; and  all other statements regarding our intent, plans, beliefs or expectations or those of our directors or officers. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place significant reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. Important factors that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, those discussed in the Risk Factors section of this prospectus, which include the following:  Demand for tire products is lower when general economic conditions are weak and decreases in the availability of consumer credit or consumer spending could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.  We depend on manufacturers to provide us with the products we sell and disruptions in these relationships or manufacturers operations could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  The failure of our information technology systems could disrupt our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our business requires a significant amount of cash, and fluctuations in our cash flows may adversely affect our ability to fund our business or acquisitions or satisfy our debt obligations.  Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. 33  The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and our failure to effectively compete may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Pricing volatility for raw materials could result in increased costs and may affect our profitability.  We face risks related to integration of our recent significant acquisitions.  We may not realize the growth opportunities and cost savings synergies that we anticipated from our recent significant acquisitions.  Attempts to expand our distribution services into new geographic markets may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  We regularly seek to grow our business through acquisitions, and our inability to identify desirable acquisition targets or integrate such acquisitions, including our recent significant acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on us.  Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement that we make in this prospectus speaks only as of the date of such statement, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of those statements to reflect future events or developments. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless specifically expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. 34 USE OF PROCEEDS We estimate that the net proceeds to us from our issuance and sale of shares of common stock in this offering will be approximately $ million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us (or approximately $ million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of common stock in full). This estimate assumes an initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to: (i) repay a portion of our long-term indebtedness; and (ii) pay a $12.5 million termination fee to TPG under our transaction and monitoring fee letter. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds, if any, for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including supporting our strategic growth opportunities in the future. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders, including if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares. After deducting the underwriting discounts, the selling stockholders will receive approximately $ million of proceeds from this offering. A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed public offering price of $ , based upon the midpoint of the estimated price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus, would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by $ million (or approximately $ million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of common stock in full), assuming the number of shares we offer, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Affiliates of TPG Capital BD, LLC, an underwriter of this offering, own in excess of 10% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Therefore, a conflict of interest is deemed to exist under FINRA Rule 5121(f)(5)(B). In addition, because the TPG Funds (as defined below) are affiliates of TPG Capital BD, LLC and, as selling stockholders, will receive more than 5% of the net proceeds of this offering, a conflict of interest is also deemed to exist under FINRA Rule 5121(f)(5)(C)(ii). Accordingly, this offering will be made in compliance with the applicable provisions of FINRA Rule 5121. In accordance with FINRA Rule 5121(c), no sales of the shares will be made to any discretionary account over which TPG Capital BD, LLC exercises discretion without the prior specific written approval of the account holder. However, no qualified independent underwriter is required because the underwriters primarily responsible for managing this offering are free of any conflict of interest, as that term is defined in the rule. See Underwriting (Conflicts of Interest). 35 DIVIDEND POLICY Our board of directors does not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock. However, we expect to reevaluate our dividend policy on a regular basis following the offering and may, subject to compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facilities and other instruments governing our indebtedness which limit our ability to pay dividends and other considerations, determine to pay dividends in the future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, which may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, the implications of the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and any other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Our ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain covenants contained in our ABL Facility (as defined below) and in the indenture that governs our Senior Subordinated Notes and may be further restricted by any future indebtedness that we incur. Our business is conducted through our subsidiaries. Dividends from, and cash generated by, our subsidiaries will be our principal sources of cash to repay indebtedness, fund operations and pay dividends. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is dependent on the earnings and distributions of funds from our subsidiaries. See Description of Indebtedness. 36 CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and capitalization at April 5, 2014:  on an actual basis;  on an as adjusted basis to give effect to (1) the issuance of shares of common stock by us in this offering and the receipt of approximately $ million in net proceeds from the sale of such shares, assuming an initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, and (2) the application of the estimated net proceeds from the offering as described in Use of Proceeds. You should read this table in conjunction with the information contained in Use of Proceeds, Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data, Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Description of Indebtedness as well as our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. As of April 5, 2014 (dollars in thousands) Actual As Adjusted (1)(2) Cash and cash equivalents $ 37,824 $ Long-term debt, including current portions: U.S. ABL Facility $ 595,964 Canadian ABL Facility 42,136 U.S. FILO Facility 74,111 Canadian FILO facility 8,501 Term Loan 299,252 Senior Secured Notes 248,330 Senior Subordinated Notes 421,181 Capital lease obligations 12,715 Other 7,916 Total debt 1,710,106 Stockholders equity: Common stock, par value $0.01 per share; 2,000,000,000 shares authorized and 767,501,736 shares issued and outstanding on an actual basis, shares authorized and shares issued and outstanding on an as adjusted basis 7,675 Additional paid-in capital 801,864 Accumulated deficit (103,862 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (14,329 ) Total stockholders equity 691,348 Total capitalization $ 2,401,454 $ (1) As adjusted reflects the application of the estimated proceeds of the offering as described in Use of Proceeds. (2) A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus, would increase (decrease) the as adjusted amount of each of cash and cash equivalents and total stockholders equity by approximately $ million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 37 DILUTION If you invest in our common stock in this offering, your interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price per share of our common stock in this offering and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock after this offering. Dilution results from the fact that the initial public offering price per share of common stock is substantially in excess of the net tangible book deficit per share of our common stock attributable to the existing stockholders for our presently outstanding shares of common stock. Our net tangible book deficit per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets (total assets less intangible assets) less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of April 5, 2014, we had a historical net tangible book deficit of $ million, or $ per share of common stock, based on shares of our common stock outstanding as of , 2014 (after giving effect to the one-for- reverse stock split effected on , 2014). Dilution is calculated by subtracting net tangible book deficit per share of our common stock from the assumed initial public offering price per share of our common stock. Investors participating in this offering will incur immediate and substantial dilution. Without taking into account any other changes in such net tangible book deficit after April 5, 2014, after giving effect to the sale of shares of our common stock in this offering assuming an initial public offering price of $ per share (the midpoint of the offering range shown on the cover of this prospectus), less the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma net tangible book deficit as of April 5, 2014 would have been approximately $ million, or $ per share of common stock. This amount represents an immediate decrease in net tangible book deficit of $ per share of our common stock to the existing stockholders and immediate dilution in net tangible book deficit of $ per share of our common stock to investors purchasing shares of our common stock in this offering. The following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis: Assumed initial public offering price per share $ Net tangible book deficit per share as of April 5, 2014, before giving effect to this offering $ Decrease in net tangible book deficit per share attributable to investors purchasing shares in this offering Pro forma net tangible book value per share, after giving effect to this offering Dilution in as adjusted net tangible book deficit per share to investors in this offering $ If the underwriters exercise their option in full to purchase additional shares, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book deficit per share of our common stock after giving effect to this offering would be $ per share of our common stock. This represents an increase in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book deficit of $ per share of our common stock to existing stockholders and dilution in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book deficit of $ per share of our common stock to new investors. Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share would increase (decrease) the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book deficit per share of our common stock after giving effect to this offering by $ , or by $ per share of our common stock, assuming no change to the number of shares of our common stock offered by us as set forth on the front cover page of this prospectus and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and expenses payable by us. 38 The following table summarizes, as of April 5, 2014, on the pro forma basis described above, the total number of shares of our common stock purchased from us, the total consideration paid to us, and the average price per share of our common stock paid by purchasers of such shares and by new investors purchasing shares of our common stock in this offering. Shares purchased Total consideration Average price per share Number Percent Amount Percent Existing stockholders $ % $ New investors $ % $ Total $ % The number of shares of common stock to be outstanding after this offering is based on shares of common stock outstanding as of , 2014 (after giving effect to the one-for- reverse stock split effected on , 2014) and excludes the following:  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options outstanding as of , 2014 at a weighted-average exercise price of $ per share; and  shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans as of , 2014. 39 SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA The following table sets forth our selected historical consolidated financial and other data for the periods indicated. The selected historical financial data as of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 and for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. The selected historical balance sheet data as of December 31, 2011 have been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of such date, which are not included in this prospectus. The selected historical financial data as of April 5, 2014 and for the first quarters of 2014 and 2013 have been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. The selected historical balance sheet data as of March 30, 2013 have been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements for such quarter, which are not included in this prospectus. On May 28, 2010, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 20, 2010, we were acquired by TPG and certain co-investors (the Merger). In the following table, periods prior to May 28, 2010 reflect our financial position, results of operations and changes in financial position prior to the Merger (the Predecessor). Periods after May 28, 2010 reflect our financial position, results of operations, and changes in financial position after the Merger (the Successor). The selected historical financial data for the fiscal year 2009 and the five months ended through May 28, 2010 which are under the Predecessor ownership and for the seven months ended January 1, 2011 which are under Successor ownership have been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements for such periods, which have not been included in this prospectus. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods, and operating results for the first quarter of 2014 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending January 3, 2015. The pro forma data for fiscal year 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 have been derived from our unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data included elsewhere in this prospectus. Our fiscal year is based on either a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to each December 31. Therefore, the financial results of 53-week fiscal years, and the associated 14-week quarter, will not be comparable to 52-week fiscal years, and the associated quarters having only 13 weeks. The 2009 fiscal year, which ended January 2, 2010, the 2011 fiscal year, which ended December 31, 2011, the 2012 fiscal year, which ended December 29, 2012, and the 2013 fiscal year, which ended December 28, 2013, each contain operating results for 52 weeks. The five months ended May 28, 2010 contains operating results for 21 weeks. The seven months ended January 1, 2011 contains operating results for 31 weeks. The quarter ended April 5, 2014 contains operating results for 14 weeks while the quarter ended March 30, 2013 contains operating results for 13 weeks. It should be noted that the Companys recently acquired subsidiaries, Hercules and Terrys Tire have different quarter-end reporting dates than that of the Company for the first quarter of 2014, with their quarters ending March 31. Prior to the acquisitions, Hercules had an October 31 fiscal year end, Terrys Tire had a December 31 fiscal year end and RTD had a January 31 fiscal year end, but each such subsidiary changed its year end to be the same as that of the Company, effective with their respective acquisition dates. It should also be noted that, prior to fiscal 2013, our year-end reporting date was different from that of our TriCan subsidiary. For fiscal 2012, TriCan had a calendar year-end reporting date. TriCan converted to our fiscal year-end reporting date during fiscal 2013. The impact from these differences on the consolidated financial statements was not material. This selected historical consolidated financial and other data should be read in conjunction with the disclosures set forth under Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information, Capitalization, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. Due to our prior acquisitions and future acquisitions we may engage in, our historical operating results may be of limited use in evaluating our historical performance and predicting future results.

(6) Other, net primarily includes bank fees, credit card charges and gains and losses on foreign currency, net of service charges to our customers. (7) As a result of the Merger, our capital structures for periods before and after the Merger are not comparable, and therefore we are presenting our net income (loss) per share and weighted-average share information only for periods subsequent to the Merger. (8) Does not reflect the one-for- reverse stock split effected on , 2014. (9) EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted to reflect the items set forth in the table below. The presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our GAAP results and the following reconciliation, we believe provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. We also believe that such measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies similar to ours. Our board of directors, management and investors use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes use a measure similar to Adjusted EBITDA to measure our compliance with certain covenants. Our board of directors also uses Adjusted EBITDA in determining compensation for our management. The adjustments from EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA include management and advisory fees paid to our Sponsor, non-cash stock compensation expense, transaction expenses related to our acquisitions, non-cash amortization of inventory step-up resulting from the business combination rules for our acquisitions and other items, including franchise and other taxes, non-cash gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets and assets held for sale, exchange gains and losses on foreign currency, and non-cash impairment of long-lived assets. Amounts presented in accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers because not all issuers calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments set forth below. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP. 42 The following table presents a reconciliation of each of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), determined in accordance with GAAP: Successor Predecessor In thousands First Quarter 2014 First Quarter 2013 Fiscal Year 2013 (1) Fiscal Year 2012 (2) Fiscal Year 2011 (3) Seven Months Ended January 1, 2011 (4) Five Months Ended May 28, 2010 Fiscal Year 2009 Net income (loss) $ (34,044 ) $ (16,291 ) $ (6,376 ) $ (14,201 ) $ (132 ) $ (49,109 ) $ (36,076 ) $ 4,932 Depreciation and amortization 29,323 25,031 105,458 89,167 78,071 40,905 14,707 32,078 Interest expense 24,399 17,240 74,316 72,910 67,572 37,387 32,669 54,415 Income tax provision (benefit) (16,606 ) (7,627 ) (3,982 ) (5,965 ) 4,464 (27,829 ) (15,227 ) 7,326 EBITDA $ 3,072 $ 18,353 $ 169,416 $ 141,911 $ 149,975 $ 1,354 $ (3,927 ) $ 98,751 Management fee 608 991 5,753 7,446 4,624 2,352 125 500 Non-cash stock compensation 567 668 2,634 4,349 4,114 3,706 5,892 326 Transaction fees 4,686 1,023 6,719 5,246 3,946 18,500 42,608  Non-cash inventory step-up 19,183 2,194 5,379 4,074  58,797   Other (A) 894 682 5,585 2,390 1,596 3,265 998 1,458 Adjusted EBITDA $ 29,010 $ 23,911 $ 195,486 $ 165,416 $ 164,255 $ 87,974 $ 45,696 $ 101,035 (A) Other includes non-income based taxes, impairment, gain/loss on property and equipment disposals, deferred comp. and foreign currency exchange gains/losses. (10) Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. (11) Total debt is the sum of current maturities of long-term debt, non-current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations. (12) Pro forma EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We present pro forma EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, in addition to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, to provide a more complete understanding of our results of operations that gives effect to the recent significant acquisitions that we have completed. These amounts have similar limitations to the limitations described in footnote (9) regarding EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, the pro forma financial information we present is based on estimates and assumptions regarding our recent acquisitions that may end up being materially different from our actual experience. Neither pro forma EBITDA nor pro forma Adjusted EBITDA should be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP or pro forma net income (loss). Moreover, our debt agreements use a measure similar to pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to measure compliance with certain covenants except that, under certain of these debt agreements, the calculation of the measure allows us (subject to certain limitations) to take into account the amount of cost savings and synergies projected in good faith to be realized in the future in connection with cost saving restructuring initiatives as though those cost savings had already been realized in past periods. We have not included such projected cost savings or synergies in our presentation of pro forma Adjusted EBITDA in this prospectus. Therefore, the amount calculated pursuant to our debt agreements may be higher than pro forma Adjusted EBITDA as set forth in this prospectus. For further discussion of our cost savings initiatives, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 The following table presents a reconciliation of each of pro forma EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma net income (loss): First Quarter Fiscal Year In thousands 2014 2013 Pro forma net income (loss) $ (52,938 ) $ (55,200 ) Depreciation and amortization 40,178 157,464 Interest expense 32,520 128,118 Income tax provision (benefit) (11,563 ) (35,266 ) Pro forma EBITDA $ 8,197 $ 195,116 Management fee 855 7,353 Non-cash stock compensation 567 5,222 Transaction fees 1,708 7,764 Non-cash inventory step-up 19,183 5,379 Other (A) 827 10,977 Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA $ 31,337 $ 231,811 (A) Other includes non-income based taxes, impairment, gain/loss on property and equipment disposals, deferred compensation and foreign currency exchange gains/losses. For a discussion of pro forma net income (loss), see Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information. 44 UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION On March 28, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Terrys Tire. The Terrys Tire acquisition was completed pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement between us and TTT Holdings, Inc. (TTT Holdings). TTT Holdings owned all of the capital stock of Terrys Tire. TTT Holdings had no significant assets or operations other than its ownership of Terrys Tire. The operations of Terrys Tire and its subsidiaries constituted the operations of TTT Holdings. Terrys Tire and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of purchasing, marketing, distributing and selling tires, wheels and related tire and wheel accessories on a wholesale basis to tire dealers, wholesale distributors, retail chains, automotive dealers and others, retreading tires and selling retread and other commercial tires through commercial outlets to end users and selling tires directly to consumers via the Internet. The Terrys Tire acquisition was completed for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $378.1 million, consisting of cash consideration of approximately $363.4 million, contingent consideration of $12.5 million and non-cash consideration for debt assumed of $2.2 million. The cash consideration paid for the Terrys Tire acquisition included estimated working capital adjustments and a portion of consideration contingent on certain events which were achieved prior to closing. The closing purchase price is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including but not limited to, working capital adjustments. On January 31, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Hercules Holdings, the parent company of Hercules. Hercules is engaged in the business of purchasing, marketing, distributing and selling replacement tires for passenger cars, trucks and certain off-road vehicles to tire dealers, wholesale distributors, retail distributors and others in the United States, Canada and internationally. The acquisition was completed for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $319.3 million, consisting of net cash consideration of $310.4 million, contingent consideration of $3.5 million and non-cash consideration for debt assumed of $5.4 million. The merger agreement provides for the payment of up to $6.5 million in additional consideration contingent upon the occurrence of certain post-closing events. The closing purchase price is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including, but not limited to, working capital adjustments. On April 30, 2013, we completed the acquisition of RTD Holdco, the parent company of RTD. RTD is a wholesale distributor of tires, tire parts, tire accessories and related equipment in the Ontario and the Atlantic provinces of Canada. The acquisition was completed for an aggregate cash consideration of $65.9 million which includes post-closing working capital adjustments. The operations of RTD constitute the operations of RTD Holdco. RTD Holdco has no significant assets or operations other than its ownership of RTD. The following presents unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 and the year ended December 28, 2013. Since the most recent balance sheet presented in this prospectus as of April 5, 2014 includes the impact of all completed acquisitions, a pro forma balance sheet as of April 5, 2014 has not been presented. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information has been prepared from, and should be read in conjunction with, the respective historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company, Terrys Tire, Hercules and RTD included in this prospectus. The Companys fiscal year is based on either a 52- or 53 week period ending on the Saturday closest to each December 31 while prior to the respective acquisition dates, Terrys Tire fiscal year ended on December 31, Hercules fiscal year ended on October 31 and RTDs fiscal year ended on January 31. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 and the year ended December 28, 2013 give effect to the acquisition of Terrys Tire, Hercules and RTD as if these transactions had occurred on December 30, 2012 (the first day of the Companys 2013 fiscal year), and includes only factually supportable adjustments that are directly attributable to the acquisitions and expected to have a continuing effect. The RTD, Terrys Tire and Hercules acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with current accounting guidance for business combinations and non-controlling interests. As a result, the total purchase price for each acquisition has been preliminarily allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The preliminary allocation reflects managements best estimates of fair value, which are based on key 45 assumptions of the acquisitions, including prior acquisition experience, benchmarking of similar acquisitions and historical data. In addition, portions of the preliminary allocation are dependent upon certain valuations and other studies that have yet to commence or progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for a definitive measurement. Upon completion of detail valuation studies and the final determination of fair value, we may make additional adjustments to the fair value allocation, which may differ significantly from the valuations set forth in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. The final allocation of the purchase price will be completed within the required measurement period in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations, but in no event later than one year following the completion of the acquisitions. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are based on estimates and assumptions, which have been made solely for the purposes of developing such pro forma information. Pro forma adjustments arising from the acquisitions are derived from the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations also includes certain purchase accounting adjustments such as increased amortization expense on acquired intangible assets, changes in interest expense on the debt incurred to complete the acquisitions and debt repaid as part of the acquisitions as well as the tax impacts related to these adjustments. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial information is not a projection of our results of operations or financial position for any future period or date. The preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information requires the use of certain estimates and assumptions, which may be materially different from our actual experience. 46 ATD Corporation Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations For the Quarter Ended April 5, 2014 (In Thousands of US Dollars) Historical Pro Forma Adjustments Pro Forma Combined ATD Corporation Hercules (January 1- Acquisition Date, January 31, 2014) Terrys Tire (January 1- Acquisition Date, March 28, 2014) Hercules Terrys Tire Use of Offering Proceeds (U) Net sales $ 1,075,469 $ 42,136 $ 106,372 $  $ (4,038 ) (H) $ 1,219,939 Cost of goods sold, excluding depreciation included in selling, general and administrative expenses below 917,314 33,719 91,021  (3,138 ) (H) 1,038,916 Selling, general and administrative expenses 177,918 6,796 18,564 1,815 (A) 5,609 (J) 58 (B) (1,089 ) (H) 209,671 Transaction expenses 4,686 29,182 60 (30,996 ) (C) (1,224 ) (K) 1,708 Operating income (loss) (24,449 ) (27,561 ) (3,273 ) 29,123 (4,196 ) (30,356 ) Other income (expense): Interest expense, net (24,399 ) (430 ) (3,374 ) 361 (D) 3,207 (L) (2,347 ) (E) (5,538 ) (M)   (32,520 ) Other, net (1,802 ) 177    (1,625 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (50,650 ) (27,814 ) (6,647 ) 27,137 (6,527 ) (64,501 ) Income tax provision (benefit) (16,606 ) (402 ) 1 10,583 (F) (2,546 ) (N) (2,593 ) (O) (11,563 ) Net income (loss) from continuing operations $ (34,044 ) $ (27,412 ) $ (6,648 ) $ 16,554 $ (1,388 ) $ (52,938 ) See accompanying notes to unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. 47 ATD Corporation Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations For the Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2013 (In Thousands of US Dollars) Historical Pro Forma Adjustments Pro Forma Combined ATD Corporation RTD (January 1 - Acquisition Date, April 30, 2013) Hercules (November 1, 2012- October 31, 2013) Terrys Tire (January 1- December 31, 2013) RTD Hercules Terrys Tire Use of Offering Proceeds (U) Net sales $ 3,839,269 $ 34,200 $ 602,921 $ 502,194 $  $  $ (23,645 ) (H) $ 4,954,939 Cost of goods sold, excluding depreciation included in selling, general and administrative expenses below 3,188,409 27,684 496,068 420,952   (18,641 ) (H) 4,374 (I) 4,118,846 Selling, general and administrative expenses 574,987 6,785 89,711 83,233 2,569 (Q) 14,906 (A) 15,820 (J)  (833 ) (G) (4,513 ) (H) 697 (B) (465 ) (P) 782,897 Transaction expenses 6,719 580     465 (P) 7,764 Operating income (loss) 69,154 (849 ) 17,142 (1,991 ) (2,569 ) (14,770 ) (20,685 ) 45,432 Other income (expense): Interest expense, net (74,316 ) (82 ) (6,396 ) (9,853 ) 82 (R) 5,269 (D) 9,719 (L) (955 ) (S) (833 ) (G) (22,455 ) (M)  (28,298 ) (E)  (128,118 ) Other, net (5,196 ) (632 ) (1,952 )     (7,780 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (10,358 ) (1,563 ) 8,794 (11,844 ) (3,442 ) (38,632 ) (33,421 ) (90,466 ) Income tax provision (benefit) (3,982 ) (853 ) 3,209 (15 ) (919 ) (T) (15,067 ) (F) (1 ) (H) (13,034 ) (N) (4,604 ) (O) (35,266 ) Net income (loss) from continuing operations $ (6,376 ) $ (710 ) $ 5,585 $ (11,829 ) $ (2,523 ) $ (23,565 ) $ (15,782 ) $ (55,200 ) See accompanying notes to unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. 48 Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information 1. Basis of Presentation These unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC Regulation S-X, and present the pro forma results of operations of the combined companies based upon the historical information after giving effect to the acquisitions of Terrys Tire, Hercules and RTD and adjustments described in these footnotes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 and the year ended December 28, 2013 are presented as if the acquisitions of Terrys Tire, Hercules and RTD had occurred on December 30, 2012 (the first day of the Companys 2013 fiscal year). Prior to their respective acquisitions, Hercules had an October 31 fiscal year end, Terrys Tire had a December 31 fiscal year end and RTD had a January 31 fiscal year end. In addition, certain amounts in the Terrys Tire and Hercules historical consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the Companys basis of presentation. 2. Pro Forma Adjustments Hercules Pro Forma Adjustments Adjustments included in the Hercules columns in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are as follows. These adjustments are based on preliminary estimates, which may change as additional information is obtained: (A) Represents estimated amortization of the finite-lived intangible assets acquired on an accelerated or straight-line basis based upon the preliminary valuation and estimated useful lives of $1.8 million and $15.4 million for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 and the year ended December 28, 2013, respectively. The estimated useful lives (ranging from 15 to 18 years) have been determined based upon various accounting studies, historical acquisition experience, economic factors and future cash flows. The pro forma adjustments for the year ended December 28, 2013 is net of $0.5 million for the reversal of the amortization of identifiable assets as previously recorded by Hercules that has been eliminated. (B) Represents estimated incremental depreciation expense related to the step-up in fair market value of Hercules property and equipment, net of $0.1 million and $0.7 million for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 and the year ended December 28, 2013, respectively. (C) Represents the reversal of transaction expenses included in the historical results for ATD Corporation and Hercules that are directly related to the acquisition and non-recurring. (D) Represents the reversal of the interest expense recognized by Hercules, including amortization of deferred financing costs related to Hercules debt that was not assumed by ATD Corporation and paid-off in conjunction with the acquisition. (E) Represents the estimated increase in interest expense associated with the issuance of $225.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 11.50% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the Additional Senior Subordinated Notes) and the incremental borrowings incurred on the Companys U.S. ABL Facility, both of which were used to finance the Hercules acquisition. In addition, the incremental amortization of deferred financing costs was included to determine the total increase in interest expense. 49 The estimated increase in interest expense is calculated as follows: In thousands Quarter Ended April 5, 2014 Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2013 Interest expense on Additional Senior Subordinated Notes (1) $ 2,156 $ 25,875 Increase in interest expense on U.S. ABL Facility (2) 125 1,510 Amortization of the original issue discount related to the Additional Senior Subordinated Notes 65 737 Change in amortization of deferred financing costs related to the ABL facility (12 ) 24 Incremental amortization of deferred financing costs related to the Additional Senior Subordinated Notes 13 152 Net adjustment $ 2,347 $ 28,298 (1) Represents additional interest expense related to the $225.0 million of Additional Senior Subordinated Notes used to finance a portion of the Hercules acquisition, based on a fixed interest rate of 11.5%. (2) Represents additional interest expense related to the incremental borrowings incurred on the Companys U.S. ABL Facility used to finance a portion of the Hercules acquisition. The Company used the weighted-average interest rate of 3.5% for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 and the fiscal year ended December 28, 2013 to calculate the estimated increase in interest expense related to incremental borrowings under the U.S. ABL Facility. A 0.125% change to interest rates on the Companys incremental U.S. ABL Facility borrowings would result in a change in pro forma interest expense of approximately $0.1 million for the year ended December 28, 2013.

These adjustments are based on preliminary estimates, which may change as additional information is obtained: (H) Reflects the reclassification of the operating results for Terrys Tire commercial and retread businesses from continuing operations, as historically presented, to discontinued operations. As part of the acquisition of Terrys Tire, the Company acquired Terrys Tires commercial and retread businesses. As the Companys core business does not include commercial and retread operations, the Company decided that it would divest of these businesses. Accordingly, pro forma adjustments have been made to reclassify the historical operating results of both the commercial and retread businesses from continuing operations, as historically presented, to discontinued operations in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations.

(2) Represents additional interest expense related to the incremental borrowings incurred on the Companys U.S. ABL Facility used to finance a portion of the Terrys Tire acquisition. The Company used the weighted-average interest rate of 3.5% for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 and the fiscal year ended December 28, 2013 to calculate the estimated increase in interest expense related to incremental borrowings under the U.S. ABL Facility. A 0.125% change to interest rates on the Companys incremental U.S. ABL Facility borrowings would result in a change in pro forma interest expense of approximately $0.5 million for the year ended December 28, 2013. (N) Represents the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments using a combined federal and state statutory income tax rate of 39.0%. This rate is an estimate and does not take into account future tax strategies that may apply to the combined Company.

This is an estimate and does not take into account future tax strategies that may apply to the combined Company. (P) Reflects the reclassification of certain amounts in Terrys Tire historical statement of operations to conform to the Companys basis of presentation. 51 RTD Pro Forma Adjustments Adjustments included in the RTD column in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 28, 2013 are as follows: (Q) Represents estimated amortization of the finite-lived intangible assets acquired on an accelerated or straight-line basis based upon the valuation and estimated useful lives. (R) Represents the reversal of the interest expense recognized by RTD related to debt that was not assumed by ATD Corporation and paid-off in conjunction with the acquisition. (S) Represents the estimated increase in interest expense associated with the incremental borrowings incurred on the Companys ABL Facility which was used to finance the RTD acquisition. In addition, the incremental amortization of deferred financing costs was included to determine the total increase in interest expense.

The Company used the weighted-average interest rate of 3.5% for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2013 to calculate the estimated increase in interest expense related to incremental borrowings under the ABL Facility. A 0.125% change to interest rates on the Companys incremental U.S. ABL Facility borrowings would result in a change in pro forma interest expense of approximately $0.1 million for the year ended December 28, 2013. (T) Represents the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments using the Canadian statutory income tax rate of 26.7%. This rate is an estimate and does not take into account future tax strategies that may apply to the combined Company.

This discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. The terms Company, we, our or us, as used herein, refer to ATD Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise stated or indicated by context. Amounts presented may not add due to rounding. Company Overview We are the largest distributor of replacement tires in North America. We provide a wide range of products and value-added services to customers in each of the key market channels to enable tire retailers to more effectively service and grow sales to consumers. Through our network of more than 140 distribution centers in the United States and Canada, we offer access to an extensive breadth and depth of inventory, representing more than 40,000 SKUs, to approximately 80,000 customers. In 2013, we distributed more than 40 million replacement tires after giving effect to recent acquisitions. We estimate that our share of the replacement passenger and light truck tire market in 2013, after giving effect to our recently completed acquisitions, would have been approximately 14% in the United States, up from approximately 1% in 1996, and approximately 18% in Canada. We serve a highly diversified customer base across multiple channels, comprised of local, regional and national independent tire retailers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, tire manufacturer-owned stores, automotive dealerships and web-based marketers. We have a significant market presence in a number of these key market channels and we believe that we are the only replacement tire distributor in North America that services each of these key market channels. During fiscal 2013, our largest customer and top ten customers accounted for 3.1% and 11.3%, respectively, of our net sales. We believe we are a top supplier to many of our customers and have maintained relationships with our top 20 customers that exceed a decade on average. We believe we distribute one of the broadest product offerings in our industry, supplying our customers with nine of the top ten leading passenger and light truck tire brands. We carry the flag brands from each of the four largest tire manufacturers Bridgestone , Continental, Goodyear and Michelin as well as the Cooper , Hankook, Kumho, Nexen, Nitto and Pirelli brands. We also sell lower price point associate and proprietary brands of these and many other tire manufacturers, and through our acquisition of Hercules we also own and market our proprietary Hercules ® brand, the number one private brand in North America in 2013 based on unit sales. In addition, we sell custom wheels and accessories and related tire supplies and tools. We believe that our large and diverse product offering allows us to penetrate the replacement tire market across a broad range of price points. Our growth strategy, coupled with our access to capital and our scalable platform, enables us to continue to expand organically in existing markets as well as in new geographic areas. We also expect to continue to employ a selective acquisition strategy to increase our share in the markets we currently service as well as to expand our distribution into new markets, utilizing our scale in an effort to realize significant synergies. In addition, we are investing in technology and each sales channel to fuel our future growth. As a result, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to achieve above-market growth in all market environments and to continue to enhance our profitability and cash flows. 53 Industry Overview The U.S. and Canadian replacement tire markets have historically experienced stable growth and favorable pricing dynamics. However, these markets are subject to changes in consumer confidence and economic conditions. As a result, tire consumers may opt to temporarily defer replacement tire purchases or purchase less costly brands during challenging economic periods when macroeconomic factors such as unemployment, high fuel costs and weakness in the housing market impact their financial health. From 1955 through 2013, U.S. replacement tire unit shipments increased by an average of approximately 3% per year. We believe that we are experiencing the beginning of a recovery after a prolonged downturn, which began in 2008 for the replacement tire market. Replacement tire unit shipments were up 4.4% in the United States and 0.7% in Canada in 2013 as compared to 2012, as a rebound in the housing market, a decline in unemployment rates and increases in vehicle sales and vehicle miles driven impacted the U.S. and Canadian replacement tire markets favorably. The RMA projects that replacement tire shipments will increase by approximately 2% in the United States 2014 as compared to 2013, as demand drivers continue to strengthen. Going forward, we believe that long-term growth in the U.S. and Canadian replacement tire markets will continue to be driven by favorable underlying dynamics, including:  increases in the number and average age of passenger cars and light trucks;  increases in the number of miles driven;  increases in the number of licensed drivers as the U.S. and Canadian population continues to grow;  increases in the number of replacement tire SKUs;  growth of the high-performance tire market; and  shortening of tire replacement cycles due to changes in product mix that increasingly favor high- performance tires, which have shorter average lives. Recent Developments Acquisitions and Expansion As part of our ongoing business strategy, we intend to expand in existing markets as well as enter into previously underserved markets and new geographic areas. Since the second half of 2010, we opened new distribution centers in 23 locations throughout the contiguous United States. We expect to continue to evaluate additional geographic markets during the remainder of 2014 and beyond. On March 28, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Terrys Tire. Terrys Tire and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of purchasing, marketing, distributing and selling tires, wheels and related tire and wheel accessories on a wholesale basis to tire dealers, wholesale distributors, retail chains, automotive dealers and others, retreading tires and selling retread and other commercial tires through commercial outlets to end users and selling tires directly to consumers via the Internet. Terrys Tire operated ten distribution centers spanning from Virginia to Maine and in Ohio. We believe the acquisition of Terrys Tire will enhance our market position in these areas and aligns very well with our distribution centers, especially our new distribution centers that we opened over the past two years in the Northeast and Ohio. In its most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, Terrys Tire generated revenues and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $502 million and $14 million, respectively and we expect the acquisition to generate annual operational synergies between $40 million and $45 million starting in 2015. For 2014, we expect to realize a portion of those synergies as we have begun the integration process. 54 On January 31, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Hercules Holdings pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated January 24, 2014. Hercules Holdings owns all of the capital stock of Hercules. Hercules is engaged in the business of purchasing, marketing, distributing, and selling replacement tires for passenger cars, trucks, and certain off-road vehicles to tire dealers, wholesale distributors, retail distributors and others in the United States, Canada and internationally. Hercules operated 15 distribution centers in the United States, six distribution centers in Canada and one warehouse in northern China. Hercules also markets the Hercules ® brand, which is one of the most sought-after proprietary tire brands in the industry. We believe the acquisition of Hercules will strengthen our presence in major markets such as California, Texas and Florida in addition to increasing our presence in Canada. Additionally, Hercules strong logistics and sourcing capabilities, including a long-standing presence in China, will also allow us to capitalize on the growing import market, as well as provide the ability to expand the international sales of the Hercules ® brand. Finally, this acquisition will allow us to be a brand marketer of the Hercules ® brand, which in 2013 had a 2% market share of the passenger and light truck market in North America and a 3% market share of highway truck tires in North America. In its most recent fiscal year ended October 31, 2013, Hercules generated revenues and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $600 million and $27 million, respectively and we expect the acquisition to generate annual operational synergies between $30 million and $35 million starting in 2015. For 2014, we expect to realize a portion of those synergies as we have begun the integration process. The following table shows the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss), for Hercules fiscal year ended October 31, 2013 and Terrys Tires fiscal year ended December 31, 2013: In millions Hercules Terrys Tire Net income (loss) $ 6 $ (12 ) Depreciation and amortization 6 12 Interest expense 7 10 Income tax provision (benefit) 3  Non-cash stock compensation 2  Other (1) 3 4 Adjusted EBITDA $ 27 $ 14 (1) Other includes management fees, restructuring initiatives, non-cash gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets and exchange gains and losses on foreign currency. On January 17, 2014, TriCan entered into and closed an Asset Purchase Agreement with Kipling Tire Co. LTD (Kipling) pursuant to which TriCan agreed to acquire the wholesale distribution business of Kipling. Kipling has operated as a retail-wholesale business since 1982. Kiplings wholesale business distributes tires from its Etobicoke facilities to approximately 400 retail customers in Southern Ontario. Kiplings retail operations were not acquired by TriCan and will continue to operate under its current ownership. This acquisition is expected to further strengthen TriCans presence in the Southern Ontario region of Canada. On April 30, 2013, we completed the acquisition of RTD Holdco pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated as of March 22, 2013, among TriCan, ATDI, RTD Holdco and RTD. RTD Holdco has no significant assets or operations other than its ownership of RTD. The operations of RTD constitute the operations of RTD Holdco. RTD is a wholesale distributor of tires, tire parts, tire accessories and related equipment in the Ontario and Atlantic provinces of Canada. Credit Agreement Amendment In addition, on June 16, 2014, we amended our credit agreement relating to our senior secured term loan facility to borrow an additional $340 million on the same terms as our existing Term Loan (as defined below). Pursuant to the amendment, until August 15, 2014, we also have the right to borrow up to an additional $80 million on the same terms as our existing Term Loan. The proceeds from these additional borrowings were or will be used to redeem all amounts outstanding under our Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) and pay related fees and expenses, as well as for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes, including the financing of potential future acquisitions. 55 Results of Operations Our fiscal year is based on either a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to each December 31. Therefore, the financial results of 53-week fiscal years, and the associated 14-week quarter, will not be comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated quarters having only 13 weeks. The 2011 fiscal year, which ended December 31, 2011, the 2012 fiscal year, which ended December 29, 2012, and the 2013 fiscal year, which ended December 28, 2013, each contain operating results for 52 weeks. The quarter ended April 5, 2014 contains operating results for 14 weeks while the quarter ended March 30, 2013 contains operating results for 13 weeks. It should be noted that the Company and its recently acquired subsidiaries, Hercules and Terrys Tire, have different quarter-end reporting dates than that of the Company for the first quarter of 2014, with their quarters ending on March 31. Prior to the acquisitions, Hercules had an October 31 fiscal year end, Terrys Tire had a December 31 fiscal year end and RTD had a January 31 fiscal year end but each such subsidiary changed its year end to be the same as that of the Company, effective as of their respective acquisition dates. It should also be noted that, prior to fiscal 2013, our year-end reporting date was different from that of our TriCan subsidiary. For fiscal 2012, TriCan had a calendar year-end reporting date. TriCan converted to our fiscal year-end reporting date during fiscal 2013. The impact from these differences on the consolidated financial statements was not material. Quarter Ended April 5, 2014 Compared to the Quarter Ended March 30, 2013 The following table sets forth the period change for each category of the statements of operations, as well as each category as a percentage of net sales: Quarter Ended Quarter Ended Period Over Period Change Period Over Period % Change Percentage of Net Sales For the Respective Period Ended In thousands April 5, 2014 March 30, 2013 Favorable (unfavorable) Favorable (unfavorable) April 5, 2014 March 30, 2013 Net sales $ 1,075,469 $ 839,978 $ 235,491 28.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 917,314 708,156 (209,158 ) (29.5 %) 85.3 % 84.3 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 177,918 136,504 (41,414 ) (30.3 %) 16.5 % 16.3 % Transaction expenses 4,686 1,023 (3,663 ) (358.1 %) 0.4 % 0.1 % Operating income (loss) (24,449 ) (5,705 ) (18,744 ) (328.6 %) (2.3 %) (0.7 %) Other income (expense): Interest expense (24,399 ) (17,240 ) (7,159 ) (41.5 %) (2.3 %) (2.1 %) Other, net (1,802 ) (973 ) (829 ) (85.2 %) (0.2 %) (0.1 %) Income (loss) from operations before income taxes (50,650 ) (23,918 ) (26,732 ) (111.8 %) (4.7 %) (2.8 %) Income tax provision (benefit) (16,606 ) (7,627 ) 8,979 117.7 % (1.5 %) (0.9 %) Net income (loss) $ (34,044 ) $ (16,291 ) $ (17,753 ) (109.0 %) (3.2 %) (1.9 %) Net Sales Net sales for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 were $1,075.5 million, a $235.5 million, or 28.0%, increase, as compared with the quarter ended March 30, 2013. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the combined results of new distribution centers as well as the acquisitions of Hercules and Terrys Tire and our 2013 acquisitions of Wholesale Tire Distributors (WTD), TDI and RTD. These growth initiatives added $167.5 million of incremental sales in the first quarter of 2014. In addition, we experienced an increase in comparable tire unit sales (which excludes sales from greenfield and acquisition locations) of $98.9 million primarily driven by an overall stronger sales unit environment and the inclusion of five additional selling days in our first quarter of 2014 which contributed approximately $47.0 million to the unit increase. However, these increases were partially offset by lower net tire pricing of $30.2 million, primarily driven by manufacturer marketing specials, competitive pricing positions in certain U.S. markets, as well as a shift in product mix in our lower priced point offerings. 56 Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 were $917.3 million, a $209.2 million, or 29.5%, increase, as compared with the quarter ended March 30, 2013. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by the combined results of new distribution centers as well as the acquisitions of Hercules, Terrys Tire, RTD, WTD and TDI. These growth initiatives added $138.6 million of incremental costs in the first quarter of 2014. Cost of goods sold for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 also includes $19.2 million related to the non-cash amortization of the inventory step-up recorded in connection with the acquisition of Hercules and WTD as compared to $2.2 million during the quarter ended March 30, 2013 recorded in connection with the acquisition of Trican. In addition, the inclusion of five additional selling days in our first quarter of 2014 and an overall stronger sales unit environment increased cost of goods sold by $83.7 million (of which approximately $41.0 million was due to the five additional selling days). These increases were partially offset by lower net tire pricing of $27.5 million. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 85.3% for the quarter ended April 5, 2014, an increase compared with 84.3% for the quarter ended March 30, 2013. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by the $19.2 million non-cash amortization of the inventory step-up recorded in connection with the Hercules and WTD acquisitions. This increase had a 2.0% impact on cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales. Adjusting for the non-cash amortization of the inventory step-up, the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by the margin contribution of the Hercules ® brand, a lower level of manufacturer price repositioning this year as compared to the prior year, and an incremental benefit from manufacturer programs during the current year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 were $177.9 million, a $41.4 million, or 30.3%, increase as compared with the quarter ended March 30, 2013. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily related to incremental costs associated with our new distribution centers as well as the acquisitions of Hercules, Terrys Tire, RTD, WTD and TDI. Combined, these factors added $32.8 million of incremental costs to the first quarter of 2014. In addition, we also experienced an $8.1 million increase in salaries and wage expense primarily related to higher incentive and commission compensation and the inclusion of five additional selling days in our first quarter of 2014, which contributed approximately $3.8 million to the year-over-year increase. Additionally, occupancy expense increased $0.8 million due to higher cost as we expanded several of our distribution centers to better service our existing customers. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 16.5% for the quarter ended April 5, 2014, an increase compared with 16.3% for the quarter ended March 30, 2013. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were primarily driven by an increase in costs associated with our growth expansion of recently opened and acquired distribution centers, as our consolidation of some of the Hercules distribution centers only commenced during the latter part of the first quarter. Transaction Expenses Transaction expenses for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 were $4.7 million and were primarily related to costs associated with our acquisitions of Hercules and Terrys Tire, as well as with expenses related to potential future acquisitions and other corporate initiatives. During the quarter ended March 30, 2013, transaction expenses of $1.0 million primarily related to costs associated with our acquisition of TriCan in November 2012, as well as with expenses related to potential future acquisitions and other corporate initiatives. Interest Expense Interest expense for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 was $24.4 million, a $7.2 million, or 41.5%, increase, compared with the quarter ended March 30, 2013. This increase was due to higher debt levels associated with our 57 ABL Facility, FILO Facility, Additional Senior Subordinated Notes and Term Loan, all as described under Liquidity and Capital Resources, which were driven by our acquisitions of Hercules and Terrys Tire and which occurred during the quarter. In addition, changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps resulted in a $0.4 million increase in interest expense. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes Our income tax benefit for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 was $16.6 million, based on pre-tax loss of $50.7 million; our effective tax rate under the discrete method was 32.8%. For the quarter ended March 30, 2013, our income tax benefit was $7.6 million, based on a pre-tax loss of $23.9 million; our effective tax rate was 31.9%. The effective rate of the year-to-date tax provision is lower than the statutory income tax rate primarily due to earnings in a foreign jurisdiction taxed at rates lower than the statutory U.S. federal rate and the impact of several non-deductible tax items as well as our state effective tax rate, a result based on our legal entity tax structure and individual state tax filing requirements. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 The following table sets forth the period change for each category of the statements of operations, as well as each category as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended Period Over Period Change Period Over Period % Change Percentage of Net Sales For the Respective Period Ended In thousands December 28, 2013 December 29, 2012 Favorable (unfavorable) Favorable (unfavorable) December 28, 2013 December 29, 2012 Net sales $ 3,839,269 $ 3,455,864 $ 383,405 11.1 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 3,188,409 2,887,421 (300,988 ) (10.4 %) 83.0 % 83.6 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 574,987 506,558 (68,429 ) (13.5 %) 15.0 % 14.7 % Transaction expenses 6,719 5,246 (1,473 ) (28.1 %) 0.2 % 0.2 % Operating income (loss) 69,154 56,639 12,515 22.1 % 1.8 % 1.6 % Other income (expense): Interest expense (74,316 ) (72,910 ) (1,406 ) (1.9 %) (1.9 %) (2.1 %) Other, net (5,196 ) (3,895 ) (1,301 ) (33.4 %) (0.1 %) (0.1 %) Income (loss) from operations before income taxes (10,358 ) (20,166 ) 9,808 48.6 % (0.3 %) (0.6 %) Income tax provision (benefit) (3,982 ) (5,965 ) (1,983 ) (33.2 %) (0.1 %) (0.2 %) Net income (loss) $ (6,376 ) $ (14,201 ) $ 7,825 55.1 % (0.2 %) (0.4 %) Net Sales Net sales for fiscal 2013 were $3,839.3 million, a $383.4 million or 11.1% increase compared with fiscal 2012. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the combined results of new distribution centers as well as the acquisition of TriCan and Firestone of Denham Springs, Inc. d/b/a Consolidated Tire & Oil (CTO) in fiscal 2012 and RTD, TDI and WTD in fiscal 2013. These growth initiatives added $464.4 million of incremental sales during fiscal 2013. In addition, despite one less selling day in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, we experienced an increase in comparable tire unit sales of $3.6 million primarily driven by an overall stronger sales unit environment particularly during the fourth quarter of 2013. However, these increases were partially offset by lower net tire pricing of $92.0 million, which included $68.8 million related to passenger and light truck tires and $15.5 million related to medium truck tires, primarily driven by manufacturer price repositioning, as well as a slight shift in product mix in our lower priced point offerings specifically our entry level imported products. 58 Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold for fiscal 2013 were $3,188.4 million, a $301.0 million or a 10.4% increase compared with fiscal 2012. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by the combined results of new distributions centers as well as the acquisition of TriCan and CTO in fiscal 2012 and RTD, TDI and WTD in fiscal 2013. These growth initiatives added $379.1 million of incremental costs during fiscal 2013. In addition, despite one less selling day in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, we experienced an overall stronger sales unit environment, particularly during fourth quarter of 2013, which increased cost of goods sold by $0.9 million. Cost of goods sold for fiscal 2013 also includes $5.4 million related to non-cash amortization of the inventory step-up recorded in connection with the acquisitions of TriCan, RTD, TDI and WTD as compared to $4.1 million during fiscal 2012. These increases were partially offset by lower net tire pricing of $78.6 million. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 83.0% for fiscal 2013, a decrease compared with 83.6% from fiscal 2012. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by a higher level of manufacturer program benefits in the current year, which was driven by an approximate 4% unit growth in the U.S., but was partially offset by a higher level of negative FIFO layers in 2013 as compared to 2012, which resulted from manufacturer price reductions. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2013 were $575.0 million, a $68.4 million or 13.5% increase compared with fiscal 2012. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily related to incremental costs associated with our new distribution centers as well as the acquisition of TriCan and CTO in fiscal 2012 and RTD, TDI and WTD in fiscal 2013. Combined, these factors added $69.6 million of incremental costs to fiscal 2013, including increased amortization expense of $12.1 million from newly established intangible assets. In addition, we experienced a $5.3 million increase to vehicle and occupancy expenses due to a higher overall consumption of fuel and other vehicle related expenses as well as increases in occupancy costs as we expanded several of our distribution centers to better service our existing customers. Depreciation expense added an additional $4.7 million of costs to fiscal 2013 as we increased our capital expenditure costs for information system technologies. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in salaries and wage expense of $9.0 million, which related to lower commission compensation, as well as, improved operating efficiencies and headcount leverage in most of our distribution centers. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 15.0% for fiscal 2013; an increase compared with 14.7% during fiscal 2012. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was substantially driven by an increase in non-cash depreciation and amortization expense. Transaction Expenses Transaction expenses for fiscal 2013 were $6.7 million and were primarily related to costs associated with our acquisitions of RTD, TDI and WTD as well as expenses related to potential future acquisitions and other corporate initiatives. Transaction expenses for fiscal 2012 were $5.2 million, which primarily related to acquisition costs associated with our acquisition of TriCan in November 2012 and CTO in May 2012 as well as with expenses related to potential future acquisitions and corporate initiatives. In addition, we incurred $1.3 million for exit costs associated with our decision to relocate an existing distribution center into an expanded distribution center during fiscal 2012. Interest Expense Interest expense for fiscal 2013 was $74.3 million, a $1.4 million or 1.9% increase compared with fiscal 2012. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels on our ABL Facility as well as our FILO 59 Facility, resulting from our acquisitions of TriCan at the end of fiscal 2012 as well as RTD, TDI and WTD during fiscal 2013. In addition, interest expense for fiscal 2012 included $2.8 million relating to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the amendment of our ABL Facility in November 2012 that did not repeat in fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2013, we also recorded $0.7 million associated with the fair value changes of our interest rate swaps. The comparable amount recorded associated with these swaps during fiscal 2012 was $1.3 million. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes Our income tax benefit for fiscal 2013 was $4.0 million. The benefit, which was based on a pre-tax loss of $10.4 million, includes $66.2 million of amortization expense that is not deductible for income tax purposes. Our income tax benefit for 2012 was $6.0 million, which was based on pre-tax loss of $20.2 million, primarily resulting from a higher state effective tax rate as well as additional amortization expense related to the valuation of intangible assets acquired, which were recorded in connection with the Merger. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 was 38.4% and 29.5%, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was higher than the statutory tax rate primarily due to the adjustment to the transaction costs related to 2013 acquisitions, the release of the valuation allowance related to various state net operating losses, and the rate differences between U.S. and Canada. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to the adjustment to the transaction costs related to the acquisition of TriCan, the impact from certain amortization expense that is non-deductible for tax purposes, and the rate differences between U.S. and Canada. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 The following table sets forth the period change for each category of the statements of operations, as well as each category as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended Period Over Period Change Period Over Period % Change Percentage of Net Sales For the Respective Period Ended In thousands December 29, 2012 December 31, 2011 Favorable (unfavorable) Favorable (unfavorable) December 29, 2012 December 31, 2011 Net sales $ 3,455,864 $ 3,050,240 $ 405,624 13.3 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 2,887,421 2,535,020 (352,401 ) (13.9 %) 83.6 % 83.1 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 506,558 437,260 (69,298 ) (15.8 %) 14.7 % 14.3 % Transaction expenses 5,246 3,946 (1,300 ) (32.9 %) 0.2 % 0.1 % Operating income (loss) 56,639 74,014 (17,375 ) (23.5 %) 1.6 % 2.4 % Other income (expense): Interest expense (72,910 ) (67,572 ) (5,338 ) (7.9 %) (2.1 %) (2.2 %) Other, net (3,895 ) (2,110 ) (1,785 ) (84.6 %) (0.1 %) (0.1 %) Income (loss) from operations before income taxes (20,166 ) 4,332 (24,498 ) (565.5 %) (0.6 %) 0.1 % Income tax provision (benefit) (5,965 ) 4,464 10,429 233.6 % (0.2 %) 0.1 % Net income (loss) $ (14,201 ) $ (132 ) $ (14,069 ) (10,658.3 %) (0.4 %) 0.0 % Net Sales Net sales for fiscal 2012 were $3,455.9 million, a $405.6 million or 13.3% increase compared with fiscal 2011. The increase in net sales was partially driven by higher net tire pricing of $167.1 million. The pricing increase, which included $127.0 million related to passenger and light truck tires and $28.1 million related to medium truck tires, resulted from our passing through tire manufacturer price increases predominately established during 2011, as well as selling a higher mix of flag brand product and a lower mix of Chinese manufactured 60 product. The combined results of new distribution centers opened since the beginning of 2011 as well as the acquisitions of TriCan, CTO and Bowlus Service Company d/b/a North Central Tire (NCT) added $181.5 million of incremental sales during fiscal 2012. In addition, an increase in comparable tire unit sales across all tire categories contributed $40.4 million, primarily driven by passenger and light truck tires. However, the increase in comparable tire unit sales was slightly impacted by destocking of lower price point inventories throughout the marketplace in anticipation of the expiration of tariffs imposed on Chinese tire imports that ceased at the end of September 2012. As a result, comparable net sales of the Chinese tire imports decreased by $34.1 million. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold for fiscal 2012 were $2,887.4 million, a $352.4 million or a 13.9% increase compared with fiscal 2011. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by the combined results of new distribution centers opening since the beginning of 2011, as well as the acquisitions of TriCan, CTO, and NCT. These growth initiatives added $159.2 million of incremental costs during fiscal 2012. In addition, higher net tire pricing of $126.3 million contributed to the increase. The pricing increase, which included $103.6 million related to passenger and light truck tires and $23.6 million related to medium truck tires, resulted from tire manufacturer price increases predominately established during 2011, as well as selling a higher mix of flag brand product and a lower mix of Chinese manufactured product. In addition, an increase in comparable tire unit sales contributed $22.8 million, primarily driven by passenger and light truck tires. Fiscal 2012 also includes $4.1 million related to the non-cash amortization of the inventory step-up recorded in connection with the acquisition of TriCan. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 83.6% for fiscal 2012, an increase compared with 83.1% from fiscal 2011. The increase in the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by a lower level of manufacturer price increases implemented during 2012 as compared to 2011, coupled with selective discounting by certain tire manufacturers during 2012 for the intention of spurring unit sales. These price increases generate favorable inventory cost layers that are passed through to our customers in the period instituted. In addition, competitive pricing pressures have increased as distributors vie for customers in a sluggish market. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2012 were $506.6 million, a $69.3 million or 15.8% increase compared with fiscal 2011. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily related to incremental costs associated with our new distribution centers opened since the beginning of 2011 as well as the acquisitions of TriCan, CTO and NCT. Combined, these factors added $28.0 million of incremental costs to fiscal 2012, including increased amortization expense of $5.0 million from newly established intangible assets. In addition, we experienced an increase to salaries and wage expense of $14.1 million, primarily due to higher sales volume and related headcount; a $9.8 million increase to vehicle expense due to a higher price per gallon of fuel, higher overall consumption of fuel and other vehicle related expenses; as well as a $6.0 million increase in occupancy costs as we expanded several of our distribution centers to better service our existing customers. Depreciation expense added an additional $5.7 million of costs to fiscal 2012 as we increased our capital expenditure costs primarily for information system technologies. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 14.7% for fiscal 2012; an increase compared with 14.3% during fiscal 2011. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by an increase in costs associated with our growth expansion of recently opened distribution centers as well as an increase in non-cash depreciation and amortization expense. Transaction Expenses Transaction expenses for fiscal 2012 were $5.2 million, which primarily related to acquisition costs associated with our acquisition of TriCan in November 2012 and CTO in May 2012 as well as with expenses 61 related to potential future acquisitions and corporate initiatives. In addition, we incurred $1.3 million for exit costs associated with our decision to relocate an existing distribution center into an expanded distribution center during fiscal 2012. Transaction expenses for fiscal 2011 were $3.9 million, which primarily related to acquisition fees as well as costs incurred in connection with both the amendment of our ABL Facility and the registration of our Senior Secured Notes with the SEC. Additionally, we incurred $1.1 million for exit costs associated with our decision to relocate two existing distribution centers into two expanded distribution centers during fiscal 2011. Interest Expense Interest expense for fiscal 2012 was $72.9 million, a $5.3 million or 7.9% increase compared with fiscal 2011. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels on our ABL Facility partially offset by lower average interest rates on the outstanding debt. In addition, $2.8 million of the year-over-year increase relates to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the amendment of our ABL Facility in November 2012 due to a change in lenders in the syndication group for the amended ABL Facility. During fiscal 2012, we also recorded $1.3 million associated with the fair value changes of our interest rate swaps. The comparable amount recorded associated with these swaps during fiscal 2011 was $0.9 million. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes Our income tax benefit for fiscal 2012 was $6.0 million. The benefit, which was based on a pre-tax loss of $20.2 million, includes $58.6 million of amortization expense that is not deductible for income tax purposes. Our income tax provision for 2011 was $4.5 million, which was based on pre-tax income of $4.3 million, primarily resulting from a higher state effective tax rate as well as additional amortization expense related to the valuation of intangible assets acquired, which were recorded in connection with the Merger. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 was 29.5% and 103.1%, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to the unfavorable adjustment to the transaction costs related to the acquisition of TriCan, the impact from certain amortization expense that is non-deductible for tax purposes, and the rate differences between U.S. and Canada. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was higher than the statutory tax rate primarily due to a 0.5% increase in our state effective tax rate, a result based on our growing presence in jurisdictions with higher than average tax rates, and the impact from certain amortization expense that is non-deductible for tax purposes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview The following table contains several key measures to gauge our financial condition and liquidity: In thousands April 5, 2014 December 28, 2013 December 29, 2012 December 31, 2011 Cash and cash equivalents $ 37,824 $ 35,760 $ 34,700 $ 23,682 Working capital 799,264 541,051 556,646 457,443 Total debt 1,710,106 967,000 951,204 835,808 Total stockholders equity 691,348 680,054 692,753 642,773 Debt-to-capital ratio (1) 71.2 % 58.7 % 57.9 % 56.5 % (1) Debt-to-capital ratio = total debt / (total debt plus total stockholders equity) We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. In doing so, we review and analyze our current cash on hand, the number of days our sales are outstanding, inventory turns, capital expenditure commitments and income tax rates. Our cash requirements consist primarily of the following:  Debt service requirements 62  Funding of working capital  Funding of capital expenditures Our primary sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations and our availability under our ABL Facility and FILO Facility. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate funds from our Canadian subsidiaries to the U.S., and no provision for U.S. income taxes has been made with respect to such earnings. We expect our cash flow from U.S. operations, combined with availability under our U.S. ABL Facility, to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements and capital spending in the U.S. during the next twelve month period. In addition, we expect our cash flow from U.S. operations and our availability under our U.S. ABL Facility to continue to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our ongoing obligations, projected working capital requirements, restructuring obligations and capital spending in the U.S. during the foreseeable future. We expect cash flows from our Canadian operations, combined with availability under our Canadian ABL Facility, to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements and capital spending in Canada during the next twelve month period and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We are significantly leveraged. Accordingly, our liquidity requirements are significant, primarily due to our debt service requirements. As of April 5, 2014, our total indebtedness was $1,710.1 million with a debt-to-capital ratio of 71.2%. The increase in cash interest payments is primarily related to higher levels of indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisitions. As of April 5, 2014, we have an additional $209.9 million of availability under our U.S. ABL Facility and an additional $38.0 million of availability under our Canadian ABL Facility. The availability under our U.S. and Canadian ABL Facilities is determined in accordance with our borrowing base. Our liquidity and our ability to fund our capital requirements is dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial and other factors that are beyond our control and many of which are described under Risk Factors. If those factors significantly change or other unexpected factors adversely affect us, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or we may not be able to obtain future financings to meet our liquidity needs. We anticipate that to the extent additional liquidity is necessary to fund our operations, it would be funded through borrowings under our U.S. and Canadian ABL Facilities or through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of liquidity. We may not be able to obtain this additional liquidity on terms acceptable to us or at all. Cash Flows The following table sets forth the major categories of cash flows: In thousands Quarter ended April 5, 2014 Quarter ended March 30, 2013 Year ended December 28, 2013 Year ended December 29, 2012 Year ended December 31, 2011 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (72,625 ) $ 2,132 $ 100,982 $ 10,072 $ (90,699 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities (689,243 ) (16,697 ) (118,435 ) (167,821 ) (92,249 ) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 765,613 4,210 22,998 168,824 186,263 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (1,681 ) (513 ) (4,485 ) (57 )  Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 2,064 (10,868 ) 1,060 11,018 3,315 Cash and cash equivalentsbeginning of period 35,760 34,700 34,700 23,682 20,367 Cash and cash equivalentsend of period $ 37,824 $ 23,832 $ 35,760 $ 34,700 $ 23,682 Cash payments for interest $ 10,464 $ 3,733 $ 68,179 $ 64,324 $ 61,732 Cash payments (receipts) for taxes, net $ 1,586 $ 1,239 $ 23,740 $ 6,510 $ (8,101 ) Capital expenditures financed by debt $  $  $ 128 $ 515 $  63 Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 was $72.6 million compared with cash provided by operating activities of $2.1 million during the quarter ended March 30, 2013. During the current period, working capital requirements resulted in a cash outflow of $85.4 million, primarily driven by an increase in customer accounts receivable of $32.3 million and an increase in inventory levels as a result of stocking new distribution centers opened and as a result of building out the product offering provided through the Hercules acquisition. Additionally, changes in accounts payable associated with the timing of vendor payments, including payments associated with winter product purchases, resulted in a cash outflow during the period of $34.4 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash earnings during the current period and changes in accrued expenses associated with accrued interest on our Senior Secured Notes. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter ended March 30, 2013 was $2.1 million. During the quarter, working capital requirements resulted in a cash outflow of $5.3 million, primarily driven by a $14.4 million cash outflow in accounts payable and accrued expenses that was associated with the timing of vendor payments related to winter tire programs. This cash outflow was offset by cash earnings during the period. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2013 was $101.0 million compared with $10.1 million for fiscal 2012. The increase is primarily driven by cash earnings during the year. In addition, working capital requirements resulted in a net cash inflow of $9.6 million during fiscal 2013, primarily driven by a change in accounts payable associated with the timing of vendor payments which resulted in a cash inflow of $29.5 million partially offset by a cash outflow of $27.6 million related to changes in inventory levels as a result of stocking new distribution centers opened and acquired during the year as well as seasonal changes in inventory stocking levels (including the Canadian winter business). Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2012 was $10.1 million compared with net cash used in operating activities of $90.7 million for fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2012, working capital requirements resulted in a cash outflow of $73.2 million, primarily driven by the continued expansion of our distribution centers into new domestic geographic markets. In addition, inventory resulted in a cash outflow of $32.2 million as a result of stocking seven new distribution centers opened during 2012 and our recent acquisitions. Accounts payable and accrued expenses changes also resulted in a cash outflow of $38.1 million primarily associated with the earlier timing of vendor payments and changes in accrued incentive compensation. Net cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2011 was $90.7 million. During fiscal 2011, working capital requirements resulted in a cash outflow of $174.5 million, primarily driven by the continued expansion of our distribution centers into new domestic geographic markets. Cash outflows of $151.9 million related to inventory reflected our decision to increase manufacturer safety stock amounts as a result of tight supply levels with most of our manufacturers, the impact of manufacturer price increases on the replenishment of our inventory as well as the impact of new, acquired or expanded distribution centers. In addition, the combined impact of stocking new distribution centers and our recent acquisitions also contributed to the inventory increase. As well, higher sales volumes led to a $47.4 million increase to accounts receivable. However, these amounts were partially offset by a $19.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily associated with the timing of vendor payments and accrued interest on our Senior Secured Notes. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 was $689.2 million, compared with $16.7 million during the quarter ended March 30, 2013. The change was primarily associated with cash paid for acquisitions, which resulted in a $671.1 million increase in the current period. In addition, we invested $14.4 million and $11.9 million in property and equipment purchases during the quarters ended April 5, 2014 and March 30, 2013, respectively, which included information technology upgrades, information technology application development and warehouse racking. 64 Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2013 was $118.4 million compared to $167.8 million during fiscal 2012. The change was primarily associated with cash paid for acquisitions, which resulted in a $38.3 million decrease during fiscal 2013. In addition, we invested $47.1 million and $52.4 million in property and equipment purchases during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively, which included information technology upgrades, IT application development and warehouse racking relating to existing and new distribution centers. During fiscal 2013 we received proceeds from the sale of assets held for sale of $7.8 million compared to $3.7 million during fiscal 2012. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2012 was $167.8 million compared to $92.2 million during fiscal 2011. The change was primarily associated with cash paid for acquisitions, which resulted in a $55.6 million increase. In addition, we invested $52.4 million and $31.0 million in property and equipment purchases during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively, which included information technology upgrades, IT application development and warehouse racking. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the quarter ended April 5, 2014 was $765.6 million, compared with $4.2 million during the quarter ended March 30, 2013. The change was primarily related to proceeds received from the issuance of our Additional Senior Subordinated Notes and Term Loan during the quarter ended April 5, 2014. These proceeds were used to finance a portion of the Hercules and Terrys Tire acquisitions. In addition, higher net borrowings from our ABL Facility and FILO Facility, specifically our U.S. ABL Facility, contributed to the period-over-period increase. The higher net borrowings under our ABL Facility and FILO Facility were due to the increase in cash outflow for working capital requirements between periods and cash paid for acquisitions. Also, the Company received an equity contribution of $50.0 million from TPG and certain co-investors during the quarter ended April 5, 2014. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2013 was $23.0 million compared with $168.8 million during fiscal 2012. The decrease was primarily related to lower net borrowings from our ABL Facility, specifically our U.S. ABL Facility due to the reduction in cash outflow for working capital requirements between periods and favorable cash earnings partially offset by cash paid for acquisition. In addition, cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2012 included a $60.0 million equity contribution received from TPG and certain co-investors that did not repeat during fiscal 2013. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2012 was $168.8 million compared with $186.3 million during fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily related to lower net borrowings from our ABL Facility due to the reduction in cash outflow for working capital requirements between periods as well as the change in outstanding checks between periods. These decreases were partially offset by a $60.0 million equity contribution received from TPG and certain co-investors during 2012. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information Cash payments for interest during the quarter ended April 5, 2014 were $10.5 million, compared with $3.7 million paid during the quarter ended March 30, 2013. The increase is primarily due to the timing of our quarter end on April 5, 2014, and as such, included an additional quarterly interest payment on our ABL Facility and FILO Facility as compared to the prior year. Additionally, higher levels of indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisitions also contributed to the year-over-year increase. Net cash payments for taxes during the quarter ended April 5, 2014 were $1.6 million, compared with $1.2 million during the quarter ended March 30, 2013. The difference between the periods primarily relates to the balance and timing of income tax extension payments and income tax payments due with returns. Cash payments for interest for fiscal 2013 were $68.2 million compared with $64.3 million during fiscal 2012. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels during fiscal 2013. In addition, we paid an additional $0.4 million during fiscal 2013 related to our interest rate swaps. 65 Cash payments for interest for fiscal 2012 were $64.3 million compared with cash payments for interest for fiscal 2011 of $61.7 million. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels during fiscal 2012 partially offset by lower average interest rates on the outstanding debt during the year. We also paid an additional $0.7 million during fiscal 2012 related to our interest rate swaps. Cash payments for taxes during fiscal 2013 were $23.7 million compared with $6.5 million during fiscal 2012. The difference between periods primarily relates to the balance and timing of estimated income tax payments and income tax payments due with returns. Cash payments for taxes during fiscal 2012 were $6.5 million, net of a receipt of $1.2 million related to a federal income tax refund. The remaining balance included payments for 2012 estimated tax payments and 2011 tax return payments. Cash receipts for taxes for fiscal 2011 were $8.1 million. During fiscal 2011, we utilized a federal net operating loss to recover a portion of our prior federal income tax paid. As a result, we received a $9.1 million tax refund in the fourth quarter of 2011 based on the use of this net operating loss carryback.

See Senior Secured Term Loan. (3) The proceeds from the additional Term Loan borrowings were used in part to redeem our Senior Secured Notes. See Senior Secured Notes. ABL Facility On January 31, 2014, in connection with the Hercules acquisition, we entered into the Second Amendment to Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) which provides for (i) U.S. revolving credit commitments of $850.0 million (of which up to $50.0 million can be utilized in the form of commercial and standby letters of credit), subject to U.S. borrowing base availability (the U.S. ABL Facility) and (ii) Canadian revolving credit commitments of $125.0 million (of which up to $10.0 million can be utilized in the form of commercial and standby letters of credit), subject to Canadian borrowing base availability (the 66 Canadian ABL Facility and, collectively with the U.S. ABL Facility, the ABL Facility). In addition, the Credit Agreement provides the U.S. borrowers under the agreement with a first-in last-out facility (the U.S. FILO Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $80.0 million, subject to a borrowing base specific thereto and the Canadian borrowers under the agreement with a first-in last-out facility (the Canadian FILO Facility and collectively with the U.S. FILO Facility, the FILO Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $15.0 million, subject to a borrowing base specific thereto. The U.S. ABL Facility provides for revolving loans available to ATDI, its 100% owned subsidiary Am-Pac Tire Dist. Inc., Hercules and any other U.S. subsidiary that we designate in the future in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The Canadian ABL Facility provides for revolving loans available to TriCan, RTD and WTD and any other Canadian subsidiaries that we designate in the future in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Provided that no default or event of default then exists or would arise therefrom, we have the option to request that the ABL Facility be increased by an amount not to exceed $200.0 million (up to $50.0 million of which may be allocated to the Canadian ABL Facility), subject to certain rights of the administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing banks with respect to the lenders providing commitments for such increase. The maturity date for the ABL Facility is November 16, 2017, provided that if on March 1, 2017, either (i) more than $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of ATDIs Senior Secured Notes remains outstanding with a scheduled maturity date which is earlier than 91 days after November 16, 2017 or (ii) any principal amount of ATDIs Senior Secured Notes remains outstanding with a scheduled maturity date which is earlier than 91 days after November 16, 2017 and excess availability under the ABL Facility is less than 12.5% of the aggregate revolving commitments, then the maturity date will be March 1, 2017. The maturity date for the FILO Facility is the date that is 36 months from January 31, 2014. As of April 5, 2014, we had $596.0 million outstanding under the U.S. ABL Facility. In addition, we had certain letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate amount of $8.4 million, leaving $209.9 million available for additional borrowings under the U.S. ABL Facility. The outstanding balance of the Canadian ABL Facility at April 5, 2014 was $42.1 million, leaving $38.0 million available for additional borrowings. As of April 5, 2014, the outstanding balance of the U.S. FILO Facility was $74.1 million and the outstanding balance of the Canadian FILO Facility was $8.5 million. Borrowings under the U.S. ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) an Adjusted LIBOR rate determined by reference to LIBOR, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, plus an applicable margin of 2.0% as of April 5, 2014 or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime commercial lending rate published by the Bank of America, N.A. as its prime rate for commercial loans, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (3) the one month-Adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.0% per annum, plus an applicable margin of 1.0% as of April 5, 2014.

The applicable margins under the Canadian FILO Facility are subject to step ups and step downs based on average excess borrowing availability under the ABL Facility. The U.S. and Canadian borrowing base at any time equals the sum (subject to certain reserves and other adjustments) of:  85% of eligible accounts receivable of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable; plus  The lesser of (a) 70% of the lesser of cost or fair market value of eligible tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable, and (b) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable; plus  The lesser of (a) 50% of the lower of cost or market value of eligible non-tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable, and (b) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible non-tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, applicable. The U.S. FILO and the Canadian FILO borrowing base at any time equals the sum (subject to certain reserves and other adjustments) of:  5% of eligible accounts receivable of the U.S or Canadian. loan parties, as applicable; plus  10.0% of the net orderly liquidation value of the eligible tire and non-tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable. All obligations under the U.S. ABL Facility and the U.S. FILO Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and substantially all of ATDIs existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned domestic material restricted subsidiaries, other than Tire Pros Francorp. The Canadian ABL Facility and the Canadian FILO Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by the U.S. loan parties, TriCan, RTD, WTD and any future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned, material restricted Canadian subsidiaries. Obligations under the U.S. ABL Facility and the U.S. FILO Facility are secured by a first-priority lien on inventory, accounts receivable and related assets 68 and a second-priority lien on substantially all other assets of the U.S. loan parties, subject to certain exceptions. Obligations under the Canadian ABL Facility and the Canadian FILO Facility are secured by a first-priority lien on inventory, accounts receivable and related assets and a second-priority lien on substantially all other assets of the U.S. loan parties and the Canadian loan parties, subject to certain exceptions. The ABL Facility and the FILO Facility contain customary covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, enter into guarantees, enter into certain mergers, make certain loans and investments, dispose of assets, prepay certain debt, declare dividends, modify certain material agreements, enter into transactions with affiliates or change our fiscal year. If the amount available for additional borrowings under the ABL Facility is less than the greater of (a) 10.0% of the lesser of (x) the aggregate commitments under the ABL Facility and (y) the aggregate borrowing base and (b) $25.0 million, then we would be subject to an additional covenant requiring us to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. As of April 5, 2014, our additional borrowing availability under the ABL Facility was above the required amount and we were therefore not subject to the additional covenants. Senior Secured Term Loan In connection with the acquisition of Terrys Tire, on March 28, 2014, ATDI entered into a credit agreement that provided for a senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million (the Term Loan). The Term Loan was issued at a discount of 0.25% which, combined with certain debt issuance costs paid at closing, resulted in net proceeds of approximately $290.9 million. The Term Loan will accrete based on an effective interest rate of 6% to an aggregate accreted value of $300.0 million, the full principal amount at maturity. The net proceeds from the Term Loan were used to finance a portion of the Terrys Tire purchase price. The maturity date for the Term Loan is June 1, 2018. Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, initially, either (a) a Eurodollar rate determined by reference to LIBOR, plus an applicable margin of 4.75% at April 5, 2014 or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (2) the prime commercial lending rate published by the Bank of America, N.A. as its prime rate for commercial loans and (3) the one month Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin of 3.75% as of April 5, 2014. The Eurodollar rate is subject to an interest rate floor of 1.0%. The applicable margins under the Term Loan are subject to a step down based on a consolidated net leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement for the Term Loan. All obligations under the Term Loan are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and, subject to certain customary exceptions, all of ATDIs existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned domestic material subsidiaries. Obligations under the Term Loan are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all property, assets and capital stock of ATDI except accounts receivable, inventory and related intangible assets and a second-priority lien on all accounts receivable and related intangible assets. The Term Loan contains customary covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional debt, create liens, enter into guarantees, enter into certain mergers, make certain loans and investments, dispose of assets, prepay certain debt, declare dividends, modify certain material agreements, enter into transactions with affiliates, change the nature of our business or change our fiscal year. Subject to certain exceptions, we are required to repay the Term Loan in certain circumstances, including with 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% and 0%, as applicable, subject to attaining certain senior secured net leverage ratios) of our annual excess cash flow, as defined in the Term Loan agreement. The Term Loan also contains repayment provisions related to non-ordinary course asset or property sales when certain conditions are met, and related to the incurrence of debt that is not permitted under the credit agreement or incurred to refinance all or any portion of the Term Loan. On June 16, 2014, we amended our credit agreement relating to our senior secured term loan facility to borrow an additional $340 million on the same terms as our existing Term Loan. Pursuant to the amendment, 69 until August 15, 2014, we also have the right to borrow up to an additional $80 million on the same terms as our existing Term Loan. The proceeds from these additional borrowings were or will be used to redeem all amounts outstanding under our Senior Secured Notes and pay related fees and expenses, as well as for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes, including the financing of potential future acquisitions. Senior Secured Notes On May 28, 2010, ATDI issued Senior Secured Notes (Senior Secured Notes) due June 1, 2017 in an aggregate principal amount at maturity of $250.0 million. The Senior Secured Notes were issued at a discount from their principal amount at maturity and generated net proceeds of approximately $240.7 million after debt issuance costs (which represents a non-cash financing activity of $9.3 million). The Senior Secured Notes will accrete based on an effective interest rate of 10% to an aggregate accreted value of $250.0 million, the full principal amount at maturity. The Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 9.75%. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2010. The Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed at any time at the option of ATDI, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price of 107.313% of the principal amount being redeemed if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2013 and May 31, 2014, 104.875% of the principal amount being redeemed if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2014 and May 31, 2015, 102.438% of the principal amount being redeemed if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2015 and May 31, 2016 and 100.0% of the principal amount being redeemed if the redemption date occurs thereafter. The Senior Secured Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and substantially all of ATDIs existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned domestic material restricted subsidiaries, other than Tire Pros Francorp and TDI, subject to certain exceptions. The Senior Secured Notes are also collateralized by a second-priority lien on accounts receivable and related assets and a first-priority lien on substantially all other assets (other than inventory), in each case of Holdings, ATDI and the guarantor subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limits ATDIs ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock; pay certain dividends or make certain distributions in respect of ATDIs capital stock or repurchase or redeem ATDIs capital stock; make certain loans, investments or other restricted payments; place restrictions on the ability of certain of ATDIs subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to ATDI; transfer or sell certain assets; guarantee indebtedness or incur certain other contingent obligations; incur certain liens; consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of ATDIs assets; enter into certain transactions with ATDIs affiliates; and designate ATDIs subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. On June 16, 2014, all outstanding amounts under our Senior Secured Notes were redeemed as described above. Senior Subordinated Notes In connection with the consummation of the Hercules acquisition, on January 31, 2014, ATDI completed the sale to certain purchasers of the Additional Senior Subordinated Notes. The net proceeds to ATDI from the sale of the Additional Senior Subordinated Notes were approximately $221.1 million. The Additional Senior Subordinated Notes were issued pursuant to the Seventh Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 31, 2014, among ATDI, the Guarantors and the Trustee (the Seventh Supplemental Indenture) to the Senior Subordinated Indenture. The Additional Senior Subordinated Notes have identical terms to the Initial Subordinated Notes, except the Additional Senior Subordinated Notes accrue interest from January 31, 2014. The Additional Senior Subordinated Notes and the Initial Subordinated Notes, as defined below, are treated as a single class of securities for all purposes under the Subordinated Indenture. However, the 70 Additional Senior Subordinated Notes were issued with separate CUSIP numbers from the Initial Subordinated Notes and are not fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the Initial Subordinated Notes. Interest on the Additional Senior Subordinated Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2014. The Additional Senior Subordinated Notes will mature on June 1, 2018. On May 28, 2010, ATDI issued $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 11.50% Senior Subordinated Notes due June 1, 2018, (the Initial Subordinated Notes and, collectively with the Additional Senior Subordinated Notes, the Senior Subordinated Notes). Interest on the Initial Subordinated Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2010. The Senior Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at any time at the option of ATDI, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price of 104.0% of the principal amount being redeemed if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2013 and May 31, 2014, 102.0% of the principal amount being redeemed if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2014 and May 31, 2015 and 100.0% of the principal amount being redeemed if the redemption date occurs thereafter. The Senior Subordinated Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and substantially all of ATDIs existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned domestic material restricted subsidiaries, other than Tire Pros Francorp, subject to certain exceptions. The indenture governing the Senior Subordinated Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limits ATDIs ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock; pay certain dividends or make certain distributions in respect of ATDIs capital stock or repurchase or redeem ATDIs capital stock; make certain loans, investments or other restricted payments; place restrictions on the ability of certain of ATDIs subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to ATDI; transfer or sell certain assets; guarantee indebtedness or incur certain other contingent obligations; incur certain liens without securing the Senior Subordinated Notes; consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of ATDIs assets; enter into certain transactions with ATDIs affiliates; and designate ATDIs subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. Contractual Commitments As of December 28, 2013, we had certain cash obligations associated with contractual commitments. The amounts due under these commitments are as follows: In millions Total Less than 1 year 1  3 years 4  5 years After 5 years Long-term debt (variable rate) (2) $ 505.4 $  $  $ 505.4 $  Long-term debt (fixed rate) (3) 449.4 0.3 0.4 448.5 0.2 Estimated interest payments (1) 265.0 68.0 129.9 59.4 7.7 Operating leases, net of sublease income 524.3 88.9 147.7 112.6 175.1 Capital leases 12.3 0.3 0.7 0.9 10.4 Uncertain tax positions 0.7 0.4 (0.2 ) 0.8 (0.3 ) Deferred compensation obligation 3.4    3.4 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,760.5 $ 157.9 $ 278.5 $ 1,127.6 $ 196.5 (1) Represents the annual interest on fixed and variable rate debt. Projections of interest expense for the U.S. ABL Facility, the Canadian ABL Facility and the U.S. FILO Facility are based on the weighted-average interest rate of 3.5%, 4.2% and 5.8%, respectively, as of December 28, 2013. Based on the combined outstanding balance of the U.S. ABL Facility, the Canadian ABL Facility and the U.S. FILO Facility as of December 28, 2013, a hypothetical increase of 1% in such interest rate percentage would result in an increase to our annual interest payments of $5.1 million. (2) Includes U.S. ABL Facility ($417.1), FILO Facility ($36.4), and Canadian FILO Facility ($51.9). (3) Includes Senior Secured Notes ($248.3), Senior Subordinated Notes ($200.0) and Other debt ($1.1). 71 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no significant off balance sheet arrangements other than liabilities related to certain leases of the Winston Tire Company (Winston). These leases were guaranteed when we sold Winston in 2001. As of April 5, 2014, our total obligations as guarantor on these leases are approximately $1.8 million extending over five years. However, we have secured assignments or sublease agreements for the vast majority of these commitments with contractually assigned or subleased rentals of approximately $1.6 million as of April 5, 2014. A provision has been made for the net present value of the estimated shortfall. The accrual for lease liabilities could be materially affected by factors such as the credit worthiness of lessors, assignees and sublessees and our success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors. These factors are significantly dependent on general economic conditions. While we believe that our current estimates of these liabilities are adequate, it is possible that future events could require significant adjustments to those estimates. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the best estimate of probable loss inherent within our accounts receivable balance. Estimates are based upon both the creditworthiness of specific customers and the overall probability of losses based upon an analysis of the overall aging of receivables as well as past collection trends and general economic conditions. Estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of our customers. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates, and impair their ability to make payments, we would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances, which would adversely impact our financial position. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the FIFO method, or fair market value and consist primarily of automotive tires, custom wheels, and related tire supplies and tools. We perform periodic assessments to determine the existence of obsolete, slow-moving and non-saleable inventories and record necessary provisions to reduce such inventories to net realizable value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, we could be required to reduce the value of our inventory or record additional reserves, which would adversely impact our financial position. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We have a history of growth through acquisitions. Assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested and reviewed annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or whenever there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than the carrying amount of the asset. 72 Recoverability of goodwill is determined using a two step process. The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed, wherein the reporting units carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value, impairment exists and must be recognized. We have only one reporting segment which encompasses all operations including new acquisitions. Recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible assets to the estimated fair value of the respective intangible assets. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. The determination of estimated fair value requires management to make assumptions about estimated cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts, discount rates, royalty rates and terminal growth rates. Management developed these assumptions based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment. We completed our assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as of November 30, 2013 and determined that no impairment existed at that date. Although no impairment has been recorded to date, there can be no assurances that future impairments will not occur. Future adverse developments in market conditions or our current or projected operating results could cause the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to fall below carrying value, which would result in an impairment charge that would adversely affect our financial position. Long-Lived Assets Management reviews long-lived assets, which consist of property, leasehold improvements, equipment and definite-lived intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets to be held and used, management evaluates recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets for which we have committed to a disposal plan, we report such assets at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less the cost to sell. In determining the fair value of long-lived assets, we make judgments relating to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets. Factors that impact these judgments include the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows. If actual fair value is less than our estimates, long-lived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet, which would adversely impact our financial position. Self-Insured Reserves We are self-insured for automobile liability, workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members, although we maintain stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit our total liability exposure. We establish reserves for losses associated with claims filed, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported, using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience. If amounts ultimately paid differ significantly from our estimates, it could adversely impact our financial position. Exit Cost Reserves During the normal course of business, we continually assess the location and size of our distribution centers in order to determine our optimal geographic footprint and overall structure. As a result, we have certain facilities that we have closed or intend to close and we record reserves for certain exit costs associated with these facilities. These exit cost reserves are recorded in an amount equal to future minimum lease payments and related 73 ancillary costs from the date of closure to the end of the lease term, net of estimated sublease rentals we reasonably expect to obtain for the property. We estimate future cash flows based on contractual lease terms, the geographic market in which the facility is located, inflation, the ability to sublease the property and other economic conditions. We estimate sublease rentals based on the geographic market in which the property is located, our experience subleasing similar properties and other economic conditions. If actual exit costs associated with closing these facilities differ from our estimates, it could adversely impact our financial position. Income Taxes and Valuation Allowances We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. The provision is computed using the asset and liability method of accounting, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In addition, we recognize future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in our judgment to be more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax items are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets considering historic profitability, projected future taxable income, and timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences as well as the feasibility of our tax planning strategies. Where appropriate, we record a valuation allowance if available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes to valuation allowances are recognized in earnings in the period such determination is made. The application of income tax law is inherently complex and involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdiction in which we operate. In addition, we are required to make certain assumptions regarding our income tax positions and the likelihood that such tax positions will be sustained if challenged. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on amounts we recognize in our consolidated balance sheets and adversely impact our financial position. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectability is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered. We recognize revenue when the title and the risk and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer, which is upon delivery under free-on-board destination terms. We permit customers from time to time to return certain products but there is no contractual right of return. We continuously monitor and track such returns and record an estimate of such future returns, based on historical experience and recent trends. While such returns have historically been within managements expectations and the provisions established have been adequate, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past. If future returns increase significantly, it could adversely impact our results of operations. Manufacturer Rebates We receive rebates from tire manufacturers pursuant to a variety of rebate programs. These rebates are recorded in accordance with accounting standards applicable to cash consideration received from vendors. Many of the tire manufacturer programs provide that we receive rebates when certain measures are achieved, generally related to the volume of our purchases. We account for these rebates as a reduction to the price of the product, which reduces the carrying value of our inventory, and our cost of goods sold when product is sold. During the 74 year, we record amounts earned for annual rebates based on purchases management considers probable for the full year. These estimates are periodically revised to reflect rebates actually earned based on actual purchase levels. Tire manufacturers may change the terms of some or all of these programs, which could increase our cost of goods sold and decrease our net income, particularly if these changes are not passed along to the customer. Customer Rebates We offer rebates to our customers under a number of different programs. These rebates are recorded in accordance with authoritative guidance related to accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer. These programs typically provide customers with rebates, generally in the form of a reduction to the amount they owe us, when certain measures are achieved, generally related to the volume of product purchased from us. We record these rebates through a reduction in the related price of the product, which decreases our net sales. During the year, we estimate rebate amounts based on the rebate rates we expect customers will achieve for the full year. These estimates are periodically revised to reflect rebates actually earned by customers. Cooperative Advertising and Marketing Programs We participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs, or co-op advertising, with our vendors. Co-op advertising funds are provided to us generally based on the volume of purchases made with vendors that offer such programs. A portion of the funds received must be used for specific advertising and marketing expenditures incurred by us or our customers. The co-op advertising funds received by us from our vendors are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance related to accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor, which requires that we record the funds received as a reduction of cost of sales or as an offset to specific costs incurred in selling the vendors products. The co-op advertising funds that are provided to our customers are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance related to accounting for cash consideration given by a vendor to a customer, which requires that we record the funds paid as a reduction of revenue since no separate identifiable benefit is received by us. Stock Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation , which requires a fair-value based method for measuring the value of stock-based compensation. Fair value is measured once at the date of grant and is not adjusted for subsequent changes. Our stock-based compensation plans include programs for stock options and restricted stock units. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include: Expected Term The expected term represents the period that stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We used the simplified method to determine the expected term, which is calculated as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. Expected Volatility Since we are currently privately held and do not have any trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded peer companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. When selecting comparable publicly traded peer companies on which we based our expected stock price volatility, we selected companies with comparable characteristics to us, including enterprise value, risk profiles, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. The historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock- 75 based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. Risk-Free Interest Rate The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of option. Expected Dividend We have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. In addition to the Black-Scholes assumptions, we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the adequacy of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover behavior, and other factors. The impact from any forfeiture rate adjustment would be recognized in full in the period of adjustment and if the actual number of future forfeitures differs from our estimates, we might be required to record adjustments to stock-based compensation in future periods. These assumptions represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of managements judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. The following table provides, by grant date, the number of stock options awarded from May 28, 2010, the date of the Merger, through the date of this prospectus and the exercise price for each set of grants, as well as the estimated fair value of the underlying common shares on the grant date: Grant Date Options Granted Exercise Price Fair Value At Issuance August 30, 2010 40,824,000 $ 1.00 $ 1.00 October 14, 2010 1,248,000 $ 1.00 $ 1.00 March 24, 2011 200,000 $ 1.00 $ 1.00 June 6, 2011 1,500,000 $ 1.00 $ 1.00 January 1, 2012 777,600 $ 1.14 $ 1.14 January 23, 2012 1,500,000 $ 1.14 $ 1.14 February 15, 2013 3,466,903 $ 1.20 $ 1.20 April 28, 2014 4,528,833 $ 1.50 $ 1.50 In the absence of a public trading market, our board of directors, with input from management, determined a reasonable estimate of the then-current fair value of our common stock for purposes of determining fair value of our stock options on the date of grant. We determined the fair value of our common stock utilizing methodologies, approaches and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our approach considered contemporaneous common stock valuations in determining the equity value of our company using a weighted combination of various methodologies, each of which can be categorized under either of the following two valuation approaches: the income approach and the market approach. In addition, we exercised judgment in evaluating and assessing the foregoing based on several factors including:  the nature and history of our business;  our current and historical operating performance;  our expected future operating performance;  our financial condition at the grant date;  the lack of marketability of our common stock;  the value of companies we consider peers based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, similarity to us with respect to industry, business model, stage of growth, intangible value, company size, geographic diversification, profitability, financial risk and other factors; 76  likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a merger or acquisition of our company given prevailing market conditions;  industry information such as market size and growth; and  macroeconomic conditions. The board of directors and management intended all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant. We generally grant options to participants with an exercise price equal to the then current fair value of the common stock. Foreign Currency Translation All foreign currency denominated balance sheet accounts are translated at year end exchange rates and revenue and expense accounts are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders equity. Transactional foreign currency gains and losses are included in other expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment which amended the guidance on the annual impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill. The amended guidance will allow a company the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If, based on the qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is required. However, if a company concludes otherwise, quantitative impairment testing is not required. This new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance on December 30, 2012 (the first day of our 2013 fiscal year); however, we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2013. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income which amended the guidance for reporting reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The amended guidance requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is entirely reclassified to net income, as required by U.S. GAAP. For other amounts, that are not required by U.S. GAAP to be entirely reclassified to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference other disclosures that will provide additional detail concerning these amounts. The amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. We adopted this guidance on December 30, 2012 and its adoption did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exits. ASU 2013-11 clarifies guidance and eliminates diversity in practice on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists at the reporting date. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2013 and subsequent interim periods. We are currently assessing the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, (ASU 2014-08). Under ASU 2014-08, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations that have a major effect on a companys operations and financial results should be 77 presented as discontinued operations. Additionally, ASU 2014-08 requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. The amendments in ASU 2014-08 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014. However, ASU 2014-08 should not be applied to a component that is classified as held for sale before the effective date even if the component is disposed of after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in financial statement previously issued. We are currently assessing the impact, if any on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue RecognitionConstructionType and ProductionType Contracts. The standards core principle is that a company should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under todays guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for us beginning in fiscal year 2018 and, at that time we may adopt the new standard under the full retrospective method or the modified retrospective method. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the method and impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk Our ABL Facility, FILO Facility and Term Loan are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates which could impact our results of operations and financial condition. Interest on the ABL Facility, FILO Facility and Term Loan are tied to, at our option, either a base rate, or a prime rate, or LIBOR. At April 5, 2014, the total amount outstanding under our ABL Facility, FILO Facility and Term Loan that was subject to interest rate changes was $1,020.0 million. To manage this exposure, we use interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge the changes in our variable interest rate debt. Interest rate swap agreements utilized by us in our hedging programs are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. To minimize the risk of counterparty non-performance, interest rate swap agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such instruments. At April 5, 2014, $620.0 million of the total outstanding balance of our ABL Facility, FILO Facility and Term Loan that was not hedged by an interest rate swap agreement and thus subject to interest rate changes. Based on this amount, a hypothetical increase of 1% in such interest rate percentages would result in an increase to our annual interest expense by $6.2 million. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The financial position and results of operations for TriCan, our 100% owned subsidiary acquired during 2012 are impacted by movements in the exchange rates between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar. As of April 5, 2014, we did not have any foreign currency derivatives in place. 78 BUSINESS Our Company We are the largest distributor of replacement tires in North America. We provide a wide range of products and value-added services to customers in each of the key market channels to enable tire retailers to more effectively service and grow sales to consumers. Through our network of more than 140 distribution centers in the United States and Canada, we offer access to an extensive breadth and depth of inventory, representing more than 40,000 SKUs, to approximately 80,000 customers. In 2013, we distributed more than 40 million replacement tires after giving effect to recent acquisitions. We estimate that our share of the replacement passenger and light truck tire market in 2013, after giving effect to our recently completed acquisitions, would have been approximately 14% in the United States, up from approximately 1% in 1996, and approximately 18% in Canada. Geographic Footprint We serve a highly diversified customer base across multiple channels, comprised of local, regional and national independent tire retailers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, tire manufacturer-owned stores, automotive dealerships and web-based marketers. We have a significant market presence in a number of these key market channels and we believe that we are the only replacement tire distributor in North America that services each of these key market channels. During fiscal 2013, our largest customer and top ten customers accounted for 3.1% and 11.3%, respectively, of our net sales. We believe we are a top supplier to many of our customers and have maintained relationships with our top 20 customers that exceed a decade on average. We believe we distribute one of the broadest product offerings in our industry, supplying our customers with nine of the top ten leading passenger and light truck tire brands. We carry the flag brands from each of the four largest tire manufacturers Bridgestone, Continental, Goodyear and Michelin as well as the Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Nexen, Nitto and Pirelli brands . We also sell lower price point associate and proprietary brands of these and many other tire manufacturers, and through our acquisition of Hercules we also own and 79 market our proprietary Hercules ® brand, the number one private brand in North America in 2013 based on unit sales. In addition, we sell custom wheels and accessories and related tire supplies and tools. We believe that our large and diverse product offering allows us to penetrate the replacement tire market across a broad range of price points. Our growth strategy, coupled with our access to capital and our scalable platform, enables us to continue to expand organically in existing markets as well as in new geographic areas. We also expect to continue to employ a selective acquisition strategy to increase our share in the markets we currently service as well as to expand our distribution into new markets, utilizing our scale in an effort to realize significant synergies. In addition, we are investing in technology and each sales channel to fuel our future growth. As a result, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to achieve above-market growth in all market environments and to continue to enhance our profitability and cash flows. From fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2013, our net sales increased from $2.2 billion to $3.8 billion, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 15.3%, and Adjusted EBITDA increased from $101.0 million to $195.5 million, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 17.9%. Over the same period, according to the RMA, unit volume in the U.S. replacement tire market grew at a compound annual growth rate of 1.2%. Our superior growth was driven by our organic initiatives and our acquisitions. In fiscal 2009, our net income was $4.9 million and in fiscal 2013 our net loss was $6.4 million. This decrease in net income was primarily the result of increased interest expense related to our acquisition by TPG in 2010, as well as interest associated with our eight acquisitions from 2010 through 2013, and non-cash amortization expense related to our intangible assets. For the quarter ended April 5, 2014 and the year ended December 28, 2013 our net sales were $1.2 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, our Adjusted EBITDA was $31.3 million and $231.8 million, respectively, and our net loss was $52.9 million and $55.2 million, respectively, in each case including the pro forma effects of our recent acquisitions. Additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, including a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) and a reconciliation of pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma net income (loss), is included in Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Data. Additional information regarding the pro forma effects of our recent acquisitions is included in Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Data and Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information. Our Industry According to Modern Tire Dealer, the U.S. replacement tire market generated annual retail sales of approximately $37.3 billion in 2013. Passenger tires, medium truck tires and light truck tires accounted for 66.9%, 16.9% and 13.1%, respectively, of the total U.S. market. Farm, specialty and other types of tires accounted for the remaining 3.1% of the total U.S. market. The Canadian replacement tire market generated annual retail sales of approximately $3.7 billion in 2012. Passenger and light truck tires accounted for 53% while commercial tires accounted for 20% of the total Canadian replacement tire market. Farm, specialty and other types of tires accounted for the remaining 27% of the total Canadian replacement tire market. According to a Tire Review survey conducted in 2013, U.S. tire dealers buy 55.4% of their consumer tires from wholesale distributors like us and 27.7% direct from tire manufacturers, with the remaining volume coming from various other sources. In the United States and Canada, replacement tires are sold to consumers through several different channels, including local, regional and national independent tire retailers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, tire manufacturer-owned stores, automotive dealerships and web-based marketers. Between 1990 and 2013, independent tire retailers and automotive dealerships have enjoyed the largest increase in U.S. replacement tire market share, according to Modern Tire Dealer , moving from 54% to 60.5% and 1% to 7.5% of the market, respectively. In 2012, replacement tire sales to independent tire retailers and automotive dealerships represented approximately 44% and 18%, respectively, of Canadian replacement tire market share. Mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, manufacturer-owned stores and web-based marketers comprise the remaining market share in both the United States and Canada. 80 Since 2000, the number of specific tire sizes in the market has increased by 61%. One driver of this increase was above-market growth in high-performance tires, which experienced a compound annual growth rate of approximately 9% between 2000 and 2008. The increase in the number of tire sizes coupled with the large number of brands in the market place has driven SKU proliferation in the replacement tire market. As a result of the SKU proliferation and due to their capital and physical space constraints, many tire retailers are unable to carry sufficient inventory to meet the demands of their customers. This trend has helped increase the need for distributors in the replacement tire market. The U.S. and Canadian replacement tire markets have historically experienced stable growth and favorable pricing dynamics. However, these markets are subject to changes in consumer confidence and economic conditions. As a result, tire consumers may opt to temporarily defer replacement tire purchases or purchase less costly brands during challenging economic periods when macroeconomic factors such as unemployment, high fuel costs and weakness in the housing market impact their financial health. From 1955 through 2013, U.S. replacement tire unit shipments increased by an average of approximately 3% per year. We believe that we are experiencing the beginning of a recovery after a prolonged downturn, which began in 2008 for the replacement tire market. Replacement tire unit shipments were up 4.4% in the United States and 0.7% in Canada in 2013 as compared to 2012, as a rebound in the housing market, a decline in unemployment rates and increases in vehicle sales and vehicle miles driven impacted the U.S. and Canadian replacement tire markets favorably. The RMA projects that replacement tire shipments will increase by approximately 2% in the United States in 2014 as compared to 2013, as demand drivers continue to strengthen. Going forward, we believe that long-term growth in the U.S. and Canadian replacement tire markets will continue to be driven by favorable underlying dynamics, including:  increases in the number and average age of passenger cars and light trucks;  increases in the number of miles driven;  increases in the number of licensed drivers as the U.S. and Canadian population continues to grow;  increases in the number of replacement tire SKUs;  growth of the high-performance tire market; and  shortening of tire replacement cycles due to changes in product mix that increasingly favor high- performance tires, which have shorter average lives. Our Competitive Strengths We believe the following key strengths have enabled us to become the largest distributor of replacement tires in North America and position us to achieve future revenue growth in excess of the long-term growth rates of the U.S. and Canadian replacement tire industry: Leading Position in a Large and Highly Fragmented Marketplace. We are the largest distributor of replacement tires in North America with an estimated market share in 2013 of approximately 14%, after giving effect to our recently completed acquisitions, in a $37.3 billion market in the United States. Our estimated market share in 2013 of the replacement passenger and light truck tire market in Canada was approximately 18%, after giving effect to our recently completed acquisitions. We believe our scale provides us key competitive advantages relative to our smaller, and generally regionally-focused, competitors. These include the ability to: efficiently stock and deliver a wide variety of tires; invest in services, including sales tools and technologies, to support our customers; and realize operating efficiencies from our scalable infrastructure. We believe our leading market position and presence in each of the key market channels, combined with our commitment to distribution, as opposed to the retail operations engaged in by our customers, enhances our ability to expand our sales footprint cost effectively both in our existing markets and in new domestic geographic markets. 81 Scale Advantage from Extensive and Efficient Distribution Network. We believe we have the largest independent replacement tire distribution network in North America with more than 140 distribution centers (excluding distribution centers acquired in our recent acquisitions that are expected to be closed as part of the integration process) and approximately 1,000 delivery vehicles. Our distribution footprint services geographic regions in the United States that represented more than 90% of the replacement tire market for passenger and light truck tires in 2013, and we believe our geographic coverage in Canada is also very extensive. Our extensive distribution footprint, combined with sophisticated inventory management and logistics technologies, enable us to deliver the vast majority of orders on a same or next day basis, which is critical for tire retailers who are typically limited by physical inventory capacity and working capital constraints. Our delivery technologies allow us to more effectively and efficiently organize and optimize our route systems to provide timely product delivery. Our distribution systems are integrated with our proprietary business-to-business ATDOnline ® order fulfillment system that captures more than 65% of our orders electronically, and our Oracle ERP system provides a scalable platform that can support future growth and ongoing cost reduction initiatives, including warehouse and truck management systems, which we believe will allow us to continue reducing warehouse and delivery costs per unit. Broad Product Offering from Diverse Supplier Base . We believe we offer the most comprehensive selection of passenger and light truck tires in the industry through a diverse group of suppliers. We supply nine of the top ten leading passenger and light truck tire brands, and we carry the flag brands from each of the four largest tire manufacturers Bridgestone, Continental, Goodyear and Michelin as well as the Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Nexen, Nitto and Pirelli brands. Our tire product line includes a full suite of flag, associate and proprietary brand tires, allowing us to service a broad range of price points from entry-level imported products to the faster-growing high-performance category. Through our acquisition of Hercules, we also own and market our proprietary Hercules ® brand, the number one private brand in North America in 2013 based on unit sales. In addition to tires, we also offer custom wheels and accessories and related tire supplies and tools. We believe that our broad product offering drives increased sales among existing customers, attracts new customers and increases customer retention. Broad Range of Value-Added Services. We provide a wide range of services that enable our tire retailer customers to operate their businesses more profitably. These services include convenient access to and timely delivery of the broadest product offerings available in the industry, as well as fundamental business support services, such as administration of tire manufacturer affiliate programs and credit, training and access to consumer market data, which enable our tire retailer customers to better service their individual markets. We provide our U.S. customers with convenient 24/7 access to our extensive product offerings through our innovative and proprietary business-to-business web portal, ATDOnline ® . Our online services also include TireBuyer.com ® , which allows our U.S. independent tire retailers the ability to participate in the Internet marketing of tires to consumers. We also provide select, qualified U.S. independent tire retailers with the opportunity to participate in our Tire Pros ® franchise program through which they receive advertising and marketing support and the benefits of a national brand identity. We believe our value-added services as well as the integration between our infrastructure and our customers operations enable us to maintain high rates of customer retention and build strong customer loyalty. Diversified Customer Base and Longstanding Customer Relationships Across Multiple Channels. We serve a highly diversified customer base in each of the key market channels, including local, regional and national independent tire retailers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, tire manufacturer-owned stores, automotive dealerships and web-based marketers. We believe we are the only distributor of replacement tires in North America that services each of these key market channels. Our business is diversified across the key market channels and reflects the evolving complexity of the North American replacement tire market, with independent tire retailers accounting for 76% of our net sales in 2013 as compared to 85% of our net sales in 2009. We believe we are a top supplier to many of our customers and maintain relationships with our top 20 customers that exceed a decade on average. We believe the diversity of our customer base and the strength of our customer relationships present an opportunity to grow market share regardless of macroeconomic and replacement tire market conditions. 82 Consistent Financial Performance and Strong Cash Flow Generation. Our financial performance has benefited from substantial growth that has been achieved through a combination of organic initiatives and acquisitions. Over the ten-year period from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2013, our net sales grew at a compound annual rate of 13.2%, reflecting our strong revenue base, evolving business mix, scalable operating model and successful growth strategies. In addition, we believe the low capital intensity of our business combined with the efficient management of our working capital, due in part to our advanced inventory management systems in the United States that we are also in the process of implementing in Canada, and close vendor relationships, will enable us to generate strong cash flows. In addition, as a result of our presence in each major channel within the replacement tire market and based upon our ability to rationalize our operating costs, as necessary, we experienced only moderate margin contraction during the recent economic downturn. Experienced Management Team Supported by Strong Equity Sponsorship. Our senior management team, led by our President and Chief Executive Officer William E. Berry, has an average of over 20 years of experience in the replacement tire distribution industry. Management has a proven track record of implementing successful initiatives in a leveraged environment, including the execution of a disciplined acquisition strategy, which has contributed to our gross profit expansion and above-market net sales growth. In addition, we have reduced costs through the integration of operating systems and introduction of standard operating practices, particularly in the United States, resulting in improved operating efficiencies, reduced headcount and improved operating profit at existing and acquired locations. We also benefit from the extensive management and business experience provided by our Sponsor, TPG. Our Business Strategy Our objective is to further expand our position as the largest distributor of replacement tires in North America and establish our company as the leading distributor in each of the key market channels that we serve, while continuing to provide our customers with a range of value-added services such as frequent and timely delivery of inventory, the broadest and deepest range of products, and other business support services. We intend to accomplish this objective, drive above-market growth and further enhance our profitability and cash flows by executing on the following key operating strategies: Grow Organically in Excess of Market. It is at the core of our strategy to grow our profits and cash flows organically through further penetration of all of our key market channels, through greenfield expansion, through further penetration of our Hercules ® brand, the number one private brand in North America in 2013 based on unit sales, through further establishment and expansion of TireBuyer.com ® , and through further expansion and development of our value-added services. Expand Penetration in Each of the Key Market Channels. We have a significant presence in each of the key market channels, including local, regional and national independent tire retailers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, tire manufacturer-owned stores, automotive dealerships and web-based marketers. We regularly seek opportunities to grow our market share in each channel by customizing our sales strategies to suit the particular needs of that channel, and are focused on training and deploying sales personnel to help build our sales, particularly in the faster-growing automotive dealership channel, and strengthen and expand our relationships with retailers. We have observed an increase in sales through web-based marketers and seek to grow our presence in that channel through our Internet site, TireBuyer.com. Continue Greenfield Expansion in Existing and New Geographic Markets. While we already have the largest distribution footprint in the North American replacement tire market, servicing geographic regions of the United States that represented more than 90% of the replacement tire market for passenger and light truck tires in 2013 and with geographic coverage in Canada that we believe is also very extensive, we believe there are numerous further underserved areas in both our existing geographic markets as well as in areas not currently serviced by us that are favorably situated to support and grow additional distribution centers. Since 2010, we have successfully opened 23 greenfield distribution centers, and we intend to continue to expand our existing footprint in the United States and Canada in areas where we see opportunities. 83 Expand Our Hercules ® Brand . Through our recently completed acquisition of Hercules, we now market the proprietary Hercules ® brand, the number one private brand in North America in 2013 based on unit sales. We believe our expansive distribution network in the United States and Canada, combined with our greater access to capital, will allow us to both expand product availability and increase market share of the Hercules ® brand. Further, we expect that Hercules multi-decade Asian sourcing experience, including its 250,000 square foot warehouse in northern China, will enhance our supply and distribution capabilities. Grow TireBuyer.com ® into a Premier Internet Tire Provider. TireBuyer.com ® is our Internet site that enables our U.S. independent tire retailer customers to connect with consumers and sell to them over the Internet. TireBuyer.com ® allows our broad base of independent tire retailers to participate in a greater share of the growing Internet tire market. We believe that TireBuyer.com ® complements and services our participating U.S. independent tire retailers by providing them access to a sales and marketing channel previously unavailable to them. In 2012, the TireBuyer.com ® site was re-launched on a newer, faster and more flexible platform, which has enhanced the overall consumer experience and resulted in increased traffic to the site. Continue to Develop and Expand our Value-Added Services . Our Tire Pros ® franchise program enables us to deliver advertising and marketing support to tire retailers operating as Tire Pros ® franchisees. The Tire Pros ® franchise program allows participating local tire retailers to enjoy the benefits of a national brand identity with minimal investment, while still maintaining their local identities. In return, we benefit from increasing volume penetration among, and further aligning ourselves with, our franchisees. We are focused on continuing to upgrade and improve the Tire Pros ® franchise program and seek opportunities to develop similar programs in the future. In addition, individual manufacturers offer a variety of relatively complex programs for tire retailers that sell their products, providing cooperative advertising funds, volume discounts and other incentives. As part of our service to our customers, we assist them in managing the administration of these programs through dedicated staff. We believe these enhancements, combined with other aspects of our customer service, provide significant value to our customers. Selectively Pursue Acquisitions . We expect to continue to employ a selective acquisition strategy to increase our share in the markets we currently service as well as to expand our distribution into new markets, utilizing our scale in an effort to realize significant synergies. Over the past six years we have successfully acquired and integrated nine businesses representing, in the aggregate, over $850 million in annual revenue through 2013, and on a pro forma basis, including our recently completed acquisitions of Hercules and Terrys Tire, the 2013 annual revenue of businesses acquired is over $2 billion in the aggregate. We believe our position as the largest distributor of replacement tires in North America, combined with our access to capital and our scalable platform, has allowed us to make acquisitions at very attractive post-synergy valuations. Leverage Our Infrastructure in Existing Markets. Through infrastructure expansions over the past several years in the United States, we have developed a scalable platform with available incremental distribution capacity. Our distribution infrastructure enables us to efficiently add new customers, such as corporate accounts, and service growing channels, such as automotive dealerships, thereby increasing profitability by leveraging the utilization of our existing assets. We expect to complete the implementation of a similar platform in Canada near the beginning of 2015. We believe our relative penetration in existing markets is largely a function of the services we offer and the length of time we have operated locally. Specifically, in new geographic markets, we have experienced growth in market share over time, and in markets that we have served the longest, we generally have market share well in excess of our national average. Utilize Technology Platform to Continue to Increase Distribution Efficiency. We intend to continue to invest in our inventory and warehouse management systems and logistics technology in order to further increase our efficiency and profit margins and improve customer service. For example, we operate on our Oracle ERP platform in the United States and are in the process of implementing it in Canada. We continue to evaluate and 84 incorporate technical solutions including utilization of handheld scanning for receiving, picking and delivery of products to our customers. We believe these increased efficiencies will continue to enhance our reputation with our customers for providing timely service, while also reducing costs. Additionally, we continue to roll out customized electronic solutions and POS system integration for our larger customers. Maintain a Comprehensive and Deep Tire Portfolio to Meet Our Customers Needs. We provide a wide range of products covering a broad range of price points, from entry-level imported products to offerings in the faster-growing high-performance tire market, through a full suite of flag, associate and proprietary brand tires. We acquired the Hercules ® brand in January 2014 and intend to further expand its market presence throughout North America. We intend to continue to focus on high-performance tires, given the growth in demand for such tires, while maintaining our emphasis on providing broad and entry level tire offerings. Our comprehensive tire portfolio is designed to satisfy all of our customers needs and allow us to become the supplier of choice, thereby increasing customer penetration and retention across all channels. Products We provide our customers with a comprehensive portfolio of tires, tire supplies and tools as well as custom wheels and accessories. During 2013, tire sales accounted for 97.4% of our net sales. Tire supplies, tools and custom wheels and accessories represented approximately 2.6% of our net sales. Tires We sell a broad selection of replacement tires, from well-known flag brands, which typically carry a premium price and profit per tire, to entry-level imported brands. We believe our ability to offer tires across multiple industry tiers provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling us to service a broad range of price points in the replacement tire market. Sales of passenger and light truck tires accounted for 82.3% of our net sales in fiscal 2013. The remainder of our tire sales was for medium trucks, farm vehicles and other specialty tires. Flag brands. Flag brands, which have the greatest brand recognition as a result of both strong sales and strong marketing support from tire manufacturers, are generally premium-quality and premium-priced offerings. The flag brands we sell have high consumer recognition and generate higher per-tire profit than associate or proprietary brands. We carry the flag brands from each of the four largest tire manufacturers Bridgestone , Continental, Goodyear and Michelin as well as the Cooper , Hankook, Kumho, Nexen, Nitto and Pirelli brands. Within our flag brand product portfolio, we also carry high-performance tires. Associate brands. Associate brands are primarily lower-priced tires manufactured by well-known manufacturers offered under different brand names. Our associate brands, such as Fuzion ® , allow us to offer tires in a wider price range. In addition, associate brands are attractive to our tire retailer customers as they are regularly subject to incentive programs offered by tire manufacturers. Proprietary and exclusive brands. Through our acquisition of Hercules, we own and market our proprietary Hercules ® brand, the number one private brand in North America in 2013 based on unit sales. The Hercules ® brand includes a full line of tires for passenger cars as well as light and medium trucks. Additionally, our Capitol ® and Ironman ® brands are lower-priced tires made by tire manufacturers exclusively for, and marketed by, us. These brands, in which we hold or control the trademark, strengthen our entry-level priced product offering and allow us to sell value-oriented tires to tire retailers, increasing our overall market penetration. Entry level imported brands . Entry level imported brands are exclusively lower-priced tires manufactured offshore, and predominately by Asia-based manufacturers. Our entry level imported brands allow us to offer tires in a wider price range including opening price point products. 85 Custom Wheels and Accessories Custom wheels directly complement our tire products as many custom wheel consumers purchase tires when purchasing wheels. Customers can order custom wheels and accessories from us separately or in addition to their regular tire orders without the added complexity of being serviced by an additional vendor. We offer over 25 different wheel brands, along with installation and service accessories. Of these brands, five are proprietary: ICW ® Racing, Pacer ® , Drifz ® , Cruiser Alloy ® and O.E. Performance ® . Other nationally available brands that complement our offering include: Gear Alloy, Motiv LuxuryAlloys, TIS (Twenty Inches Strong) and Dropstars, which also includes Monster Energy Edition wheel styles, Advanti Racing, Black Rock, BMF, Cragar, Dick Cepek, Fondmetal, Focal, Platinum, Lexani, Mickey Thompson, Mamba, Konig and Ultra Wheel. Collectively, these brands represent one of the most comprehensive wheel offerings in the industry. Sourcing of product is worldwide through a number of manufacturers. Tire Supplies and Tools We supply our customers with a wide array of tire supplies and tools which enable them to better service their customers as well as help them become more profitable businesses. Our tire supplies and tools are the most popular brand names from leading manufacturers. These products broaden our portfolio and leverage our customer relationships. Customers We serve a highly diversified customer base comprised of local, regional and national independent tire retailers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, tire manufacturer-owned stores, automotive dealerships and web-based marketers. We sell to approximately 80,000 customers (approximately 73,000 in the U.S. and 7,000 in Canada). In fiscal 2013, our largest customer and our top ten customers accounted for less than 3.1% and 11.3%, respectively, of our net sales. We believe we are a top supplier to many of our customers and maintain relationships with our top 20 customers that exceed a decade on average. Suppliers We purchase our tires from several sources, including the four largest tire manufacturers, Bridgestone, Continental, Goodyear and Michelin , from whom we bought 58.6% of our tire products in fiscal 2013. In general, we do not have long-term supply agreements with tire manufacturers, instead relying on oral arrangements or written agreements that are renegotiated annually and can be terminated on short notice. However, we have conducted business with our major tire suppliers for an average of over 20 years, and we believe that we have good relationships with all of our major suppliers. In recent years, tire manufacturers have reduced the number of tire retailers they service directly. As a result of this change, tire retailers have increasingly relied on us, and we have become a more critical link between manufacturers and tire retailers. There are a number of worldwide manufacturers of wheels and other automotive products. Most of the wheels we purchase are proprietary brands, namely, Pacer ® , Cruiser Alloy ® , Drifz ® , O.E. Performance ® and ICW ® Racing, and are produced by a variety of manufacturers. Distribution System We have designed our distribution system to deliver products from a wide variety of tire manufacturers to our tire retailer customers. In recent years, we believe tire manufacturers have reduced the number of tire retailers they service directly and tire retailers have reduced the inventory they hold. At the same time, the depth and breadth of replacement SKUs has continued to expand. As a result of these changes, tire retailers have increasingly relied on us and we have become a more critical link in enabling tire retailers to more efficiently manage their business. 86 We utilize a sophisticated inventory and delivery system to distribute our products to most customers on a same or next day basis. In our U.S. distribution centers, we use sophisticated bin locator systems, material handling equipment and routing software that link customer orders to our inventory and delivery routes. We believe this distribution system, which is integrated with our innovative and proprietary business-to-business ATDOnline ® ordering and reporting system, provides us a competitive advantage by allowing us to ship customer orders quickly and efficiently while also reducing labor costs. Our logistics and routing technology uses third-party software packages and GPS systems, including dynamic routing and Roadnet 5000, to optimize route design and delivery capacity. Coupled with our fleet of approximately 1,000 delivery vehicles, this technology enables us to cost effectively make multiple daily or weekly shipments to customers as necessary. Approximately 80% of our U.S. tire purchases are shipped directly by tire manufacturers to our U.S. distribution centers. The remainder is shipped by manufacturers to our redistribution centers located in Maiden, North Carolina and Bakersfield, California and we have begun to roll out these technologies in Findley, Ohio. These redistribution centers warehouse slower-moving and foreign-manufactured products, which are forwarded to our U.S. distribution centers as needed. Information Systems Through infrastructure expansions over the past several years, we have developed a scalable platform with incremental capacity available. We are currently completing the U.S. implementation of an Oracle ERP system that supports future growth and ongoing cost reduction initiatives, including warehouse and truck management systems, which we believe will allow us to continue reducing warehouse and delivery costs per unit. The ERP implementation, which is nearing completion in the United States, has largely replaced our legacy computer system. We continue to implement technical solutions across the United States including handheld scanning for receiving, picking and delivery of product to our customers. In addition, we are preparing to implement a similar Oracle ERP platform in Canada near the beginning of 2015. Additionally, we continue to roll out customized electronic solutions and POS system integration for our larger customers. Inventory Control We believe that we maintain levels of inventory that are adequate to meet our customers needs on a same day or next day basis. Since customers look to us to fulfill their needs on short notice, inventory levels are a primary focus of our business model. As a result, backlog of orders is not considered material to, or a significant factor in, evaluating and understanding our business. Our inventory levels are determined using sales data derived from distribution centers (on a combined basis, an individual basis or by geographic region) as well as from vendors who supply the distribution centers and retail customer stores that are served by the distribution centers. All distribution centers stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their general managers. Computer systems monitor inventory levels for all stock items and quantities are periodically re-balanced from center-to-center. Marketing and Customer Service Our marketing efforts are focused on driving growth through customer service, additional product placement and market expansion. We provide a range of services which enable our tire retailer customers to operate their businesses more profitably. These services include frequent and timely delivery of inventory, as well as fundamental business support services, such as administration of tire manufacturer affiliate programs and credit, training and access to consumer market data, which enable our tire retailer customers to better service their individual markets. In addition, we provide our U.S. customers with an online web portal with convenient 24/7 access to our inventory, an Internet site that allows our U.S. tire retailer customers to participate in the Internet marketing of tires to customers as well as a franchise program in the United States where we deliver advertising and marketing support to our tire retailer customers. 87 Sales Force We have structured our sales organization to best serve our existing customers and develop new prospective customers such as automotive dealerships. As the manufacturers have reduced their own sales staffs, our sales force has assumed the consultative role manufacturers previously provided to tire retailers. Our tire sales force consists of sales personnel at each distribution center plus a sales administrative team located at our field support center in Huntersville, North Carolina. Sales teams, consisting of salespeople and customer service representatives, focus on tire retailers located within the service area of the distribution center and include a combination of tire-, wheel- and supplies-focused sales personnel. Some sales personnel visit targeted customers to advance our business opportunities and those of our customers, while other sales personnel remain at our facility, making client contact by telephone to advance specific products or programs. Customer service representatives manage incoming calls from customers and provide assistance with order placement, inventory inquiries and general customer support. The Huntersville-based sales administrative team directs sales personnel at the distribution centers and manages our corporate account customers, including large national and regional retail tire and service companies. This team also manages our Huntersville-based call center, which provides call management assistance to the U.S. distribution centers during peak times of the day, thereby minimizing customer wait time, and also provides support upon any disruption in a distribution centers local telephone service. They also serve as the primary point of contact for product and technical inquiries from TireBuyer.com ® shoppers. Automotive dealerships are focused on growing their service business in an effort to expand profitability, and we believe they view having replacement tire capabilities as an important service element. Between 1990 and 2013, U.S. automotive dealerships enjoyed a large increase in market share according to Modern Tire Dealer , moving from 1% of the U.S. replacement tire market to 7.5% of the market. Over the past few years we have steadily trained and deployed sales personnel to help build our sales at these accounts. We continue to invest and focus resources in this channel to strengthen and expand our relationships with the automobile manufacturers and further grow our share of tire sales to their dealerships. Our aftermarket wheel sales group employs sales and technical support personnel in the field and performance specialists in each region. The responsibilities of this sales group include cultivating new prospective wheel and supplies customers as well as coordinating with tire sales professionals to cover existing accounts. The technical support professionals provide answers to customer questions regarding wheel style and fitment and supplies. Tire Retailer Programs Through our Tire Pros ® franchise program we deliver advertising and marketing support to U.S. tire retailer customers operating as Tire Pros ® franchisees. U.S. independent tire retailers participating in this franchise program enjoy the benefits of a national brand identity with minimal investment, while still maintaining their local identity. We anticipate increasing volume penetration among, and further aligning ourselves with, franchisees. Individual manufacturers offer a variety of programs for tire retailers that sell their products, such as Bridgestones Affiliated Retailer Network, Continentals Gold, Goodyears G 3 X, Kumhos Fuel and Michelins Alliance. These programs, which are relatively complex, provide cooperative advertising funds, volume discounts and other incentives. As part of our service to our customers, we assist in the administration of these programs for the manufacturers and enhance these programs through dedicated staff to assist tire retailers in managing their participation. We believe these enhancements, combined with other aspects of our customer service, provide significant value to our customers. We also offer our U.S. tire retailer customers ATDServiceBAY ® , which makes available a comprehensive suite of benefits including nationwide tire and service warranties (through third-party warranty 88 providers), a nationally accepted, private-label credit card (through GE Money), access to consumer market data and training and marketing programs to provide our tire retailer customers with the support and service that are critical to succeed in todays increasingly competitive marketplace. Order Fulfillment ATDOnline ® provides our U.S. customers with web-based online ordering and 24/7 access to our inventory availability and pricing. Orders are processed automatically and printed in the appropriate distribution center within minutes of entry through ATDOnline ® . Our customers are able to track expected deliveries and retrieve copies of their signed delivery receipts. ATDOnline ® also allows customers to track account balances and participate in tire manufacturer incentive programs. As a key element of our order fulfillment strategy, ATDOnline provides an a robust solution for order-tracking, logistics management, distribution, installation and payment services. We encourage our customers to use this system because it represents a more efficient method of order entry and information access than traditional order systems. In fiscal 2013, approximately 65% of our total order volume was ordered through ATDOnline ® , up from 56% in fiscal 2007. In 2014, we updated this site to provide a more modern platform with many upgrades and capabilities. TireBuyer.com ® is our Internet site that enables our U.S. independent tire retailer customers to connect with consumers and sell to them over the Internet. Consumers using TireBuyer.com ® choose to buy from a select, qualified independent tire retailer participating in our TireBuyer.com ® program. We then distribute the purchased products to the selected tire retailer for local installation. The tire retailer receives the full revenue of the transaction, less any applicable processing fees, upon product installation. We employ a third-party provider to handle the online billing and payment process. We do not handle customers credit card or other sensitive information. We account for revenues from TireBuyer.com ® in the same manner as other orders received from tire retailer customers. The TireBuyer.com ® transaction structure allows us to retain our distribution focus, while strengthening our relationship with our tire retailer customers by providing them access to a sales and marketing channel previously unavailable to them. In 2012, the TireBuyer.com ® site was re-launched on a newer, faster and more flexible platform, which has enhanced the overall consumer experience and resulted in increased traffic to the site. Trademarks The proprietary brand names under which we market our products are trademarks of our company. We value our brand names because they help develop brand identification. All of our trademarks are of perpetual duration as long as they are periodically renewed. We currently intend to maintain all of them in force. The principal proprietary brand names under which we market our products are: HERCULES ® tires, IRONMAN ® tires, CAPITOL ® tires, NEGOTIATOR ® tires, REGUL ® tires, DYNATRAC ® tires, CRUISERALLOY ® custom wheels, DRIFZ ® custom wheels, ICW ® custom wheels, PACER ® custom wheels and O.E. PERFORMANCE ® custom wheels. Our other trademarks include: AMERICAN TIRE DISTRIBUTORS ® , ATD ® , TRICAN TIRE DISTRIBUTORS INC ® , REGIONAL TIRE DISTRIBUTORS ® , ATDONLINE ® , ATDSERVICEBAY ® , TIREBUYER.COM ® and TIRE PROS ® . Competition The U.S. and Canadian tire distribution industry is highly competitive and fragmented. In these markets, replacement tires are sold to consumers through several different market channels, including local, regional and national independent tire retailers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, tire manufacturer-owned stores, automotive dealerships and web-based marketers. We compete with a number of tire distributors on a regional basis. Our main competitors include TBC/Treadways Wholesale (owned by Sumitomo), which has retail operations that compete with its distribution customers, and TCI Tire Centers (owned by Michelin). In the 89 automotive dealership channel, our principal competitor is Dealer Tire, which is focused principally on administering replacement tire programs for selected automobile manufacturers dealerships. In the online channel, our principal competitor is Tire Rack, which is principally focused on high-performance offerings, acting as both a retailer and a wholesaler. Seasonality Although the effects of seasonality in the United States are not significant to our business, we have historically experienced an increase in net sales in the second and third fiscal quarters and an increase in working capital in the first fiscal quarter. In Canada, however, as a result of the winter driving season we recognize a larger percentage of sales and EBITDA during the second half of the year. Environmental Matters Our operations and properties are subject to federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, treatment, emission, release, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, substances and waste as well as relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties, including off-site disposal locations. We do not incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations. However, we could be subject to material environmental costs, liabilities or claims in the future, especially in the event of the adoption of new environmental laws or changes in existing laws and regulations or in their interpretation. Employees As of December 28, 2013, our operations employed approximately 3,800 people, approximately 3,400 of which are located in the United States and the balance located within our Canadian distribution centers. None of our employees are represented by a union. We believe our employee relations are satisfactory. Properties Our principal properties are geographically situated to meet sales and operating requirements. We believe that our properties have been well maintained, are generally in good condition and are suitable for the conduct of our business. As of April 5, 2014, we operated 136 distribution centers located in 43 states in the United States and 28 distribution centers in Canada, aggregating approximately 17.0 million square feet. We expect some of the distribution centers acquired in our recent acquisitions to be closed as part of the integration process. Of these centers, two are owned by us and the remaining properties are leased. We also lease our principal executive office, located in Huntersville, North Carolina. This lease is scheduled to expire in 2022. In addition, we have some non-essential properties which we are attempting to sell or sublease. Several of our property leases contain provisions prohibiting a change of control of the lessee or permitting the landlord to terminate the lease or increase rent upon a change of control of the lessee. Based primarily upon our belief that (i) we maintain good relations with the substantial majority of our landlords, (ii) most of our leases are at market rates and (iii) we have historically been able to secure suitable leased property at market rates when needed, we believe that these provisions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. Legal Proceedings We are involved from time to time in various lawsuits, including class action lawsuits arising out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Although no assurances can be given, we do not expect that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. We are also involved in various litigation proceedings incidental to the ordinary course of our business. We believe, based on consultation with legal counsel, that none of these will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 90 MANAGEMENT Executive Officers and Directors Below is a list of the names, ages as of April 5, 2014, positions and a brief account of the business experience of the individuals who serve as our executive officers and directors as of the date of this prospectus.

This section provides an analysis of our executive compensation program, the material compensation decisions made under this program during fiscal 2013, and the material factors considered in making those decisions during fiscal 2013. This section is followed by a series of tables containing specific information about the compensation earned in fiscal 2013 by the following individuals, referred to as our named executive officers: William E. Berry, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason T. Yaudes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; J. Michael Gaither, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; David L. Dyckman, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Phillip E. Marrett, Executive Vice President, Product Planning and Positioning (1) . (1) Mr. Marrett will cease to be our Executive Vice President, Product Planning and Positioning as of July 31, 2014 and will serve as a consultant to us through the end of 2014. Decision-making Responsibility Decisions regarding the compensation of our named executive officers are made by our board of directors, after taking into account recommendations from management regarding compensation opportunities for the fiscal year, as further described below. Compensation Philosophy and Objectives The overall goal of our board of directors in compensating our executive officers is to attract, retain and motivate key executives of superior ability who are critical to our future success. Our board of directors believes that both the short-term and long-term incentive compensation paid to our named executive officers should be directly aligned with our performance, and that compensation should be structured to ensure that a significant portion of our named executive officers compensation opportunities is directly related to the achievement of financial and operational goals and other factors that impact stockholder value. The compensation decisions of our board of directors with respect to our named executive officers salaries, annual incentives and long-term incentive compensation awards are influenced by the executives level of responsibility and function, our overall performance and profitability and our boards assessment of the competitive marketplace (as determined based on our board members business experience). Our board of directors also takes into account each named executive officers tenure and individual performance, our overall annual budget, and changes in the cost of living. Our executive compensation package consists of base salary, target annual bonus, and long-term incentives, as well as additional benefits and perquisites. We have no set policy for allocating pay between the various elements of compensation and instead evaluate our named executive officers compensation opportunities on a case-by-case basis after taking into account the factors described above. To achieve competitive positioning for the annual cash compensation component of our executive compensation program, 98 our board of directors sets base salaries at a level it believes to be competitive but places more emphasis on annual bonus opportunities because they are more directly linked to our performance. Thus, our compensation is focused less on fixed pay and more on performance-based opportunities, while still intending to remain competitive overall. Targeted annual cash bonus opportunities are based on, among other things, our budgeted financial goals and other factors, which may fluctuate from year to year. Our board of directors also believes that the best way to directly align the interests of our executives with the interests of our stockholders is to provide opportunities for our executives to maintain an appropriate level of equity ownership throughout their tenure with us. Our compensation program achieves this objective through our use of equity-based long-term incentive awards. Our executive compensation program is continually evaluated for effectiveness in achieving the stated objectives of our board of directors as well as to reflect the economic environment within which we operate. Overview of Executive Compensation Components In fiscal 2013, our executive compensation program consisted of several compensation elements, as noted in the table below and further described below. Pay Element What the Pay Element Rewards Purpose of the Pay Element Base Salary Core competence of the executive relative to skills, experience and contributions to us. Provides fixed compensation based on competitive market practice. Annual Cash Incentive Contributions toward our achievement of specified financial targets and other key performance criteria. Provides focus on meeting annual goals that lead to our short- and long-term success. Stock Options Appreciation in the value of our shares after the stock options were granted. Achievement of specified financial targets. Retention and continued contributions to our success. Provides focus on our performance as follows:  aligns the interests of our executives with the interests of our stockholders;  rewards the achievement of performance goals (for performance-based options); and  encourages retention of our named executive officers with vesting schedules that apply to our time- and performance-based options. Retirement Benefits Participation in our 401(k) plan and our nonqualified deferred compensation plan incentivizes employee retirement savings and continued service to the Company. Provides attractive tax-deferred retirement savings vehicles for eligible executives and promotes retention of our executives over a longer-term time horizon. 99 Pay Element What the Pay Element Rewards Purpose of the Pay Element Welfare Benefits Executives participate in employee benefit plans generally available to our employees, including medical, health, life insurance and disability plans. These benefits are part of our broad-based total compensation program. Certain named executive officers are also provided with supplemental health benefits, which reward executives for their service in leadership roles. We believe we benefit from these perquisites by encouraging our executive officers to protect their health. Additional Benefits and Perquisites Certain named executive officers are reimbursed for club memberships and all our named executive officers are provided with a vehicle allowance. These benefits reward executives for their service in leadership roles. Consistent with offering our executives a competitive compensation program. Termination Benefits Our named executive officers are parties to employment agreements that provide them with severance benefits if the named executive officers employment is terminated without cause or the officer leaves for good reason, each as defined in the agreements. These arrangements reward executives for their continued service to the Company and subject them to restrictive covenants that protect the Companys interests. Termination benefits are designed to retain executives and provide security for our named executive officers so their focus remains on driving the Companys performance. The use of these programs enables us to reinforce our pay for performance philosophy, as well as strengthen our ability to attract and retain highly qualified executives. We believe that this combination of programs provides an appropriate mix of fixed and variable pay, balances short-term operational performance with long-term stockholder value, and encourages executive recruitment and retention. Elements of Compensation and Determination of Pay Levels Base Salary Historically, base salary levels have reflected a combination of factors including the executives experience and tenure, our overall annual budget, the executives individual performance, and changes in responsibility. Our board of directors does not target base salary at any particular percent of total compensation. Our board of directors reviews salary levels annually using the factors described above and takes into account salary recommendations made by our Chief Executive Officer and other senior members of management. In fiscal 2013, there were no base pay increases granted to our named executive officers that took effect in fiscal 2013. In December 2013, our board of directors approved an increase in Mr. Yaudes base salary from $350,000 to $400,000 that took effect on January 1, 2014 in recognition of Mr. Yaudes increased responsibilities and success in his role as our Chief Financial Officer. 100 Annual Incentive Plan Our annual incentive plan provides our named executive officers with an opportunity to earn annual cash bonuses based on our achievement of certain pre-established performance goals. As in setting base salaries, our board of directors, after taking into account recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer and other senior members of management, considers a combination of the factors described above in establishing the annual target bonus opportunities for our named executive officers, which vary from year to year. Budgeted EBITDA (as defined below) is the primary factor considered, as target bonus opportunities are adjusted annually when our board of directors sets our annual budget, which includes our Budgeted EBITDA goals, for the year. Budgeted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that refers to our net income or loss from our consolidated statements of comprehensive income before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, which is then further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash, non-recurring, cost reduction and other adjustment items. Target bonus opportunities are defined as a percentage of the overall bonus pool, which is set as described below. We do not target annual bonus opportunities at any particular percentage of base salary or total compensation. In December of each year, our board of directors sets a bonus pool for the following year for all executives covered by our annual incentive plan, the size of which is equal to a designated percentage of Budgeted EBITDA actually achieved by us. Budgeted EBITDA was selected as the performance metric for our annual incentive plan because we believe it is an important measure of our financial performance and our ability to create free cash flow. No bonus pool is funded if actual performance falls below 90% of the Budgeted EBITDA goal. The pool grows pro-rata for actual performance between 90% and 100% of the Budgeted EBITDA goal. Above 100% of the Budgeted EBITDA goal, the pool grows by approximately 20% of each incremental dollar. The bonus pool is divided among participants in our annual incentive plan based on each participants designated percentage of the bonus pool, as described above. We set the Budgeted EBITDA goal for fiscal 2013 bonus opportunities at a level that was intended to reflect improvement in performance over the prior fiscal year, specific market conditions and better-than-average growth within our competitive industry. For fiscal 2013, the targeted bonus pool was $10.1 million, subject to adjustment, based upon a Budgeted EBITDA target of $214.8 million. The percentage of the targeted bonus pool designated for each named executive officer for fiscal 2013 was: Mr. Berry, 15.3%; Mr. Dyckman, 6.9%; and Messrs. Yaudes, Gaither and Marrett, 5.3% each. For fiscal 2013, we achieved 91.0% of the Budgeted EBITDA goal, which resulted in a total bonus pool paid of $5.6 million. The amount of the actual bonuses paid to our named executive officers for fiscal 2013 are included in the Summary Compensation Table under the heading Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation. Stock Options We provide our named executive officers with long-term incentive opportunities in the form of stock options. All outstanding stock options were granted under the ATD Corporation Management Equity Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time, which we refer to as the 2010 Plan. Each of our named executive officers received a grant of stock options following the Sponsors acquisition of the Company in fiscal 2010 that was intended to cover a multi-year period and generally align the interests of our senior management team with those of the Sponsor. The sizes of those grants were determined by our board of directors based on its experience, after consultation with our Chief Executive Officer, taking into account the fact that they were intended to serve as incentives over a longer-term period. We do not make annual stock option grants to our named executive officers and have only made additional stock option grants to our named executive officers in limited circumstances. 101 In fiscal 2013, we made additional stock option grants to each of our named executive officers following the Sponsors purchase of additional common stock of the Company in connection with the acquisition of RTD (described above under the heading Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information), which had resulted in the equity ownership of our named executive officers and other holders of our common stock being diluted. Our board of directors decided to make these grants so as to generally maintain the equity ownership levels of our named executive officers (on a fully diluted basis) before and after the additional equity purchase by the Sponsor. Fifty percent of each stock option grant made to our named executive officers consists of time-based stock options and fifty percent of each stock option grant consists of performance-based options. The initial post-acquisition grants made in 2010 to our named executive officers were each eligible to vest over the five-year period following the closing of the acquisition on May 28, 2010. In order to maintain our named executive officers focus on maximizing our performance over that five-year period, subsequent grants to our named executive officers generally have had shorter vesting schedules that are aligned with the vesting schedule that applied to the initial post-acquisition grants. Consequently, all time-based options granted to our named executive officers in fiscal 2013 vest in three equal installments, with the first installment having vested on May 28, 2013, the second installment having vested on May 28, 2014 and the last installment scheduled to vest on May 28, 2015, generally subject to the named executive officer remaining continuously employed by us through such vesting date. For the initial post-acquisition grants, each performance-based option was eligible to vest in equal installments on each of the first five anniversaries following the closing of the acquisition if, as of the end of the most recent fiscal year ending on or prior to the applicable anniversary, we achieved the EBITDA target established for such fiscal year by the terms of the option at the time the option was granted. If the EBITDA target is not met for the relevant fiscal year, the performance-based option remains outstanding until terminated and immediately vests upon (i) except with respect to performance-based options eligible to vest as part of the final tranche subject to the grant, achievement of cumulative EBITDA targets for the fiscal year and the first fiscal year following that fiscal year or (ii) the occurrence of a liquidity event in which the Sponsor receives a cash return on its investment in us of at least 220%. As with the time-based options, subsequently granted performance-based options generally are eligible to vest over a shorter period that is aligned with the vesting schedule that applied to the initial post-acquisition grants. All performance-based options granted to our named executive officers in fiscal 2013 vest in three equal installments, with the first installment having vested on May 28, 2013 based on fiscal 2012 EBITDA, the second installment having failed to vest on May 28, 2014 due to our not having achieved the fiscal 2013 EBITDA target (but remaining eligible to vest as described above) and the last installment eligible to vest on May 28, 2015 based on fiscal 2014 EBITDA, generally subject to the named executive officer remaining continuously employed by us through such vesting date. Performance-based options granted in 2013 to our named executive officers are also eligible to vest based on our two-year cumulative EBITDA or the cash return to the Sponsor in connection with a liquidity event on the same terms as described above. Investment in the Company Each of our named executive officers made a direct cash investment in our common stock shortly following the Sponsors acquisition of us. Offering our named executive officers the opportunity to invest in our common stock aligns their interests with the interests of our other stockholders, leads them to act as employee owners of our company and allows them to benefit from increases in value that they helped to create. The number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by each of named executive officers is described below under the heading Principal and Selling Stockholders. Retirement Plans Our named executive officers participate along with our other employees and/or other executives in our 401(k) plan and our nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Under our 401(k) plan, we make a matching 102 contribution of 50% of employee contributions up to 6% of compensation, subject to certain limits under the Internal Revenue Code, and employees vest in Company matching contributions as to 20% of the amount of the contributions for each of their first five years of service. Our deferred compensation plan is a nonqualified plan comprised of a voluntary deferral program that allows our named executive officers to defer a portion of their annual salary and bonus and a noncontributory program that provides for certain contributions to be made on behalf of certain executives by us according to a board-approved schedule. Our deferred compensation plan is described further below under the heading Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal 2013 and our contributions to this plan are included under that heading as well as in the Summary Compensation Table. We believe that our retirement programs serve as an important tool to attract and retain our named executive officers and other key employees. We also believe that offering a baseline of stable retirement benefits encourages our named executive officers to make a long-term commitment to us. We do not adjust the level of retirement benefits based on the value of a named executive officers long-term incentive awards nor do we adjust the level of a named executive officers total direct compensation for a given year in light of the value of retirement benefits. Severance and change in control arrangements We provide severance protection to each of our named executive officers pursuant to their employment agreements. Certain limited change in control-related protections apply to stock options held by our named executive officers. Our severance and change in control protections are designed to be fair and competitive and to aid in attracting experienced executives, including our named executive officers. The terms of the severance and change in control protections we provide are described below under the heading Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control. Perquisites and Other Benefits We provide vehicle allowances to each of our named executive officers and reimburse Messrs. Berry, Gaither and Dyckman for the cost of dues at country clubs. In addition, we sponsor an executive medical program for our executive officers, which provides for reimbursement to certain named executive officers and eligible dependents for medical expenses not covered by our group medical plan. Our board of directors believes that the costs of providing these perquisites and benefits are reasonable relative to their value to our named executive officers. Tax Deductibility Because our common stock is not currently publicly traded, executive compensation paid in fiscal 2013 was not subject to the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which limits the deductibility of compensation paid to certain individuals to $1 million, excluding qualifying performance-based compensation and certain other compensation. Following this offering, at such time as we are subject to the deduction limitation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, we expect that our board of directors (or a newly formed compensation committee) will consider the impact of Section 162(m). 103 Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 The following table summarizes compensation for our named executive officers for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011.

In fiscal 2013, we achieved 91% of the Budgeted EBITDA target, exceeding the threshold level discussed in footnote (1) above but not meeting the target level of performance. Actual bonuses paid to our named executive officers are included in the Summary Compensation Table under the heading Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation. (3) There is no limit on the maximum amount payable under our annual incentive plan. (4) Represents the number of performance-based options granted to our named executive officers under the 2010 Plan in fiscal 2013. All performance-based options granted to our named executive officers in fiscal 2013 vest in three equal installments, with the first installment having vested on May 28, 2013 based on fiscal 2012 EBITDA, the second installment having failed to vest on May 28, 2014 due to our not having achieved the fiscal 2013 EBITDA target (but remaining eligible to vest as described below) and the last installment eligible to vest on May 28, 2015 based on fiscal 2014 EBITDA, generally subject to the named executive officer remaining continuously employed by us through such vesting date. If the EBITDA target is not met for fiscal 2014, the performance-based option remains outstanding until terminated and immediately vests upon the occurrence of a liquidity event in which the Sponsor receives a cash return on its investment in us of at least 220%, generally subject to the named executive officer remaining employed by us through the vesting date. Because the EBITDA target was not met for fiscal 2013, performance-based options eligible to vest based on fiscal 2013 EBITDA, to the extent they remain outstanding, are eligible to vest based upon achievement of a cumulative EBITDA target for fiscal years 2013 and 2014. (5) Represents the number of time-based options granted to our named executive officers under the 2010 Plan in fiscal 2013. All time-based options granted to our named executive officers in fiscal 2013 vest in three equal installments, with the first installment having vested on May 28, 2013, the second installment having vested on May 28, 2014 and the last installment scheduled to vest on May 28, 2015, generally subject to the named executive officer remaining continuously employed by us through such vesting date. (6) Represents the aggregate grant date fair value of option awards granted during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2013, calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures. The fair value of the options was calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For a discussion of the assumptions used in the valuation, see Note 12 in our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table We are a party to an employment agreement with each of our named executive officers. The term of each agreement will continue until the named executive officers termination of employment, unless the parties otherwise agree to terminate the agreement. Each agreement sets forth the named executive officers initial base salary, which has been subsequently increased prior to fiscal 2013 (except in the case of Mr. Yaudes, whose base salary of $350,000 was set in his employment agreement dated January 23, 2012 and remained in effect during fiscal 2013) and provides that the named executive officer is entitled to an annual performance-based cash bonus on such terms as are determined by our board of directors and is entitled to participate in the benefit plans maintained by the Company and made available to all executive officers. The agreements with Messrs. Berry, Yaudes and Gaither require us to provide the named executive officer with a monthly car allowance ($1,600 per month for Mr. Berry, $1,200 per month for Mr. Yaudes and $1,400 per month for Mr. Gaither) and, for Messrs. Berry and Gaither, also require us to reimburse them for club membership dues of up to $500 per month. For a description of the payments and benefits our named executive officers may be entitled to in connection with a termination of employment and/or a change in control and a description of the restrictive covenants covering our named executive officers, see Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control. 106 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal 2013 Year End The following table provides information concerning outstanding options held by our named executive officers as of December 28, 2013, the last day of our 2013 fiscal year.

The time-based options expiring on August 30, 2020 vest in equal installments on each of the first five anniversaries of May 28, 2010; as of the end of fiscal 2013, 40% of each grant had not yet vested. Mr. Yaudes time-based options expiring on January 23, 2022 vest in equal installments on each of the first five anniversaries of May 28, 2012; as of the end of fiscal 2013, 80% of Mr. Yaudes grant had not yet vested. Except as described below, the time-based options expiring on February 15, 2023 vest in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of May 28, 2012; as of the end of fiscal 2013, 66.6% of each grant had not yet vested. Of Mr. Yaudes time-based options that expire on February 15, 2023, 37,236 are subject to the vesting terms described in the immediately preceding sentence. The remaining 57,463 time-based options vest in equal installments on each of the first five anniversaries of May 28, 2012; as of the end of fiscal 2013, 80% of the grant had not yet vested. In each case, the vesting of options is contingent on the named executive officer remaining continuously employed by us through the applicable vesting date. (2) Represents the number of unearned and unexercised performance-based options held by our named executive officers as of December 28, 2013. The performance-based options expiring on August 30, 2020 vest in equal installments on each of the first five anniversaries of May 28, 2010, provided that we have met the EBITDA target established for the preceding fiscal year; as of the end of fiscal 2013, 40% of each grant had not yet vested. Mr. Yaudes performance-based options expiring on January 23, 2022 vest in equal installments on each of the first five anniversaries of May 28, 2012, provided that we have met the EBITDA target established for the preceding fiscal year; as of the end of fiscal 2013, 80% of Mr. Yaudes grant had not yet vested. Except as described below, the performance-based options expiring on February 15, 2023 vest in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of May 28, 2012, provided that we have met the EBITDA target established for the preceding fiscal year; as of the end of fiscal 2013, 66.6% of each grant had not yet vested. Of Mr. Yaudes performance-based options that expire on February 15, 2023, 37,236 are subject to the vesting terms described in the immediately preceding sentence. The remaining 107 57,463 performance-based options vest in equal installments on each of the first five anniversaries of May 28, 2012, provided that we have met the EBITDA target established for the preceding fiscal year; as of the end of fiscal 2013, 80% of the grant had not yet vested. With respect to each performance-based option, if the EBITDA target is not met for the relevant fiscal year, the performance-based option remains outstanding until terminated and immediately vests upon (i) except with respect to performance-based options eligible to vest as part of the final tranche subject to the grant, achievement of cumulative EBITDA targets for the relevant fiscal year and the first fiscal year following that fiscal year, or (ii) the occurrence of a liquidity event in which the Sponsor receives a cash return on its investment in us of at least 220%. In each case, the named executive officer generally must remain employed through the applicable vesting date in order for the applicable performance-based options to vest. (3) The exercise price of all stock options is equal to 100% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date the options were granted, as determined by our board of directors after considering, among other things, the results of an independent third party valuation. Option exercises and stock vested None of our named executive officers exercised any stock options or became vested in any stock awards during our 2013 fiscal year. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2013 We sponsor a nonqualified deferred compensation plan in which all of our named executive officers are eligible to participate. Under the deferred compensation plan, a participant is permitted to defer up to 75% of his base salary and up to the full amount of his annual bonus, other performance-based compensation and any 401(k) plan refund. We may also make discretionary contributions to the deferred compensation plan on behalf of participants in an amount determined by our board of directors. In fiscal 2013, we continued our prior practice of making contributions to the plan on behalf of Messrs. Berry, Gaither and Marrett in the amounts shown below. Each participants elective deferrals under the plan are fully vested upon deferral; our contributions to the plan are only fully vested after a participant has provided five years of service to the Company, with 20% vesting on each of the first five anniversaries of the participants first day of service. Each participant may direct the investment of his account under the deferred compensation plan based on the investment alternatives available under the plan, which include a variety of equity, fixed income and other investment alternatives. A participant may receive a distribution upon his or her death, a separation from service, disability, a change in control event or an unforeseeable emergency. All distributions will be in the form of a lump sum, except that a participant may elect to receive distributions in installments over a period of up to five years in the event of his or her disability and, if a participant has attained either age 62 or age 55 with ten years of service, he or she may elect to receive distributions in installments over a period of up to ten years. 108 The following table sets forth information regarding our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, showing, with respect to each named executive officer, the aggregate contributions made by such executive officer, the aggregate contributions made by the Company, the aggregate earnings accrued and the aggregate value of withdrawals and distributions to the executive officer, in each case, during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2013 and the balance of his account under this plan as of December 28, 2013.

We or the employee may terminate the applicable employment agreement at any time. Upon termination of employment for any reason, the named executive officer is entitled to receive a basic termination payment equal to his base salary earned through the date of termination and the previous years bonus to the extent earned. In the event of the termination of Mr. Berrys employment for any reason other than cause, we have agreed to provide for the continued participation of him and his family in our health plan at our expense until the time he reaches age 65. In addition, if we terminate the employment of any of our named executive officers without cause or if the named executive officer resigns for good reason (each as defined in his employment agreement), he is entitled to the following severance payments and, in the case of Messrs. Yaudes, Gaither, Dyckman and Marrett, continuation of health benefits: Mr. Berry is entitled to receive a monthly sum equal to his monthly base salary in effect at such time plus $25,000 for a period of two years (in addition to the health benefits that would be provided upon a termination for any reason other than a termination for cause). Mr. Yaudes is entitled to receive: (i) a monthly sum equal to his monthly base salary in effect at such time for a period of 12 months and (ii) continuation of health benefits for a period of 12 months. Mr. Gaither is entitled to receive: (i) a monthly sum equal to his monthly base salary in effect at such time plus $22,222.22 for a period of 18 months and (ii) continuation of health benefits for a period of 18 months. Mr. Dyckman is entitled to receive: (i) a monthly sum equal to his monthly base salary in effect at such time plus $20,833.34 for a period of 12 months and (ii) continuation of health benefits for a period of 12 months. Mr. Marrett is entitled to receive: (i) a monthly sum equal to his monthly base salary in effect at such time plus $19,583.33 for a period of 12 months and (ii) continuation of health benefits for a period of 12 months. Each named executive officer has agreed to sign a release of claims in connection with a termination of employment. The employment agreements contain confidentiality, non-compete and non-solicit provisions. The non-compete and non-solicit provisions apply during the named executive officers employment and for a post-employment period equal to the following: Mr. Berry24 months; Mr. Gaither18 months; and Messrs. Yaudes, Dyckman and Marrett12 months. Stock Options Under the 2010 Plan, if a named executive officers employment is terminated within two years of a change of control transaction either by us without cause or by the named executive officer for good reason, 100% of the named executive officers outstanding time-based options become immediately vested and exercisable. In addition, the option grant agreements for each of the named executive officers provide that in the event of termination by us without cause or by the named executive officer for good reason, whether following a change of control transaction or not, (i) any time-based options that would have vested within six months of termination will become immediately vested on the termination date; and (ii) any performance-based options that would have vested within six months of termination if the employee had continued to be employed will vest upon the date the applicable performance criteria are determined to have been achieved. 110 Payment Summary The table below reflects the amount of compensation payable to each named executive officer in the event of termination of the executives employment for various reasons or a change in control. The table does not include amounts payable under the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, payments that would be made to a named executive officer under benefit plans or employment terms generally available to other salaried employees, such as group life or disability insurance, accrued but unpaid salary or payments under our annual incentive plan, which are earned if the named executive officer works through the end of the relevant fiscal year. The amounts shown assume that a termination of employment and/or a change in control occurred on December 28, 2013, the last day of our 2013 fiscal year.

(2) Amounts shown in Acceleration of Time-Based Stock Options above represent the aggregate spread on all outstanding unvested time-based options held by the named executive officer on December 28, 2013, assuming a fair market value on December 28, 2013 of $1.50 per share (as determined by our board of directors). Because none of the outstanding performance-based options held by our named executive officers would have vested within six months following December 28, 2013 based on our fiscal 2013 EBITDA or would have vested had a change in control occurred on December 28, 2013 assuming the Sponsor had received a price per share of $1.50, for purposes of this table we have assumed that none of the named executive officers would have vested in his outstanding unvested performance-based options had a termination of employment or a change in control occurred on that date. (3) In the event of the death or disability of a named executive officer, the named executive officer will receive benefits under our disability plan or payments under our life insurance plan, as appropriate. These payments are generally available to all employees and are therefore not included in the above table. 111 (4) Other than the performance-based options described above, which are eligible to vest if the Sponsor receives a certain return on its investment in us in connection with certain corporate transactions, we do not provide our named executive officers with severance or other payments that are payable on a change in control without an accompanying qualifying termination. If a named executive officer were terminated following a change in control, such officer would receive payments and benefits pursuant to the employment agreements and 2010 Plan and stock option agreements, in each case, as described above. Compensation of Directors For their service as members of our board of directors, each of James Farrell, Gary Kusin, James Micali, Carl Sewell, and David Krantz (the Outside Directors) receive an annual fee of $150,000 in cash, payable in quarterly installments. Upon their appointment to our board of directors, each of the Outside Directors also received a one-time grant of options under the 2010 Plan to purchase 200,000 shares of our common stock with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. These options vested in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. In October 2010, we adopted the ATD Corporation. Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Plan (the Restricted Stock Plan). Each Outside Director may receive, at the discretion of our board of directors, an annual grant under the Restricted Stock Plan of restricted shares of our common stock valued at $50,000, with vesting to occur in two equal installments on each of the first two anniversaries of the date of grant. For fiscal 2013, no restricted shares were granted to the Outside Directors. Each Outside Director also received a one-time opportunity to purchase up to $1,000,000 of our common stock, at a per share price equal to the fair market value on the date of purchase. The number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by each of directors is described below under the heading Principal and Selling Stockholders. These equity arrangements were entered into to further align our Outside Directors interests with the interests of our stockholders. The members of our board of directors other than the Outside Directors do not receive separate compensation for their service as directors of our board of directors. Mr. Sewell resigned from the Board on July 10, 2013. The following table sets forth the compensation paid to our directors in fiscal 2013: Name Fees Earned or Paid in Cash ($) Stock Awards(1) Total ($) James Farrell $ 150,000  $ 150,000 Gary Kusin 150,000  150,000 James M.

Farrell, Kusin, Micali and Krantz each held 21,930 unvested shares of restricted stock and neither of our other directors held any other unvested stock awards. As at December 28, 2013, Messrs. Farrell, Kusin, Micali and Krantz each held 200,000 stock options, and neither of our other directors held any stock options. (2) Mr. Sewell resigned from our board of directors on July 10, 2013. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation Executive compensation and related decisions are made by the Board, which does not currently have a compensation committee. 112 Equity and Cash Incentive Plans In connection with this offering, we intend to adopt a new equity incentive plan and a new cash incentive plan. Upon adoption of this new equity incentive plan, we will no longer make awards under the 2010 Plan (described below). When these plans are adopted we will supplement this disclosure with a description of their material terms. 2010 Plan The following is a description of the material terms of the 2010 Plan (as amended and restated on April 28, 2014). This summary is not a complete description of all provisions of the 2010 Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2010 Plan, which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. Plan administration . The 2010 Plan is administered by our board of directors, which has the authority to, among other things, determine eligible persons to whom grants of stock options will be made, determine the time or times when grants shall be made and the number of shares of common stock subject to each grant, prescribe the forms of and the terms and conditions of any instrument evidencing a grant, adopt, amend and rescind such rules and regulations as, in its opinion, may be advisable for the administration of the 2010 Plan, construe and interpret the 2010 Plan, and the instruments evidencing grants, and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2010 Plan. Authorized shares . Subject to adjustment under the terms of the 2010 Plan, the maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be delivered in satisfaction of stock options granted under the 2010 Plan is 54,433,333. As of June 1, 2014, stock options with respect to 54,045,336 shares have been granted under this plan. Eligibility . Our board of directors selects participants from among those key executives and other employees, directors, service providers or consultants of the company or its affiliates. Types of awards; vesting . Only stock options may be granted under the 2010 Plan. Unless otherwise determined by our board of directors, 50% of each award will be subject to a time-based vesting schedule and 50% of the award will be subject to a performance-based vesting schedule. All options, whether vested or not, expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they are earlier terminated. Termination of employment or service . Upon a termination of employment or service all then unvested options that will be forfeited without consideration; however, in the event of a termination of a participants employment or other service relationship by us without cause or by the participant for good reason (each, as defined in the 2010 Plan) within the two-year period following a change in control of the Company, all time-based options held by the participant will immediately vest and become exercisable. Unless otherwise provided in an option agreement, vested options will remain exercisable for one year following a participants death or disability, 90 days following the termination of a participants employment or other service relationship by us without cause or by the participant resignation for good reason, and 30 days following a termination of a participants employment or other service relationship by the participant other than for good reason. If a participants service is terminated for cause, all options requiring exercise (whether or not vested) will terminate on the commencement of business on the date of such termination. Transferability . Stock options granted under the 2010 Plan may not be transferred except through will or by the laws of descent and distribution, or, subject to compliance with applicable laws, to a trust or custodianship created by the participant the beneficiaries of which are the participants spouse or lineal descendants (by blood or adoption) with prior written approval by our board of directors. 113 Corporate transactions . Unless otherwise provided in an option agreement, in the event of a dissolution or liquidation the company, the sale of substantially all of our assets, a merger or consolidation in which the company is not the surviving corporation, or a merger or consolidation in which the company is the surviving corporation but stockholders receive securities of another corporation and/or other property (including cash), our board of directors may provide for new grants in substitution of outstanding awards or for the cancellation of any awards immediately prior to the event for cash consideration equal to the spread on the options. In the event of a merger or consolidation in which the company is the surviving corporation (except when stockholders receive securities of another corporation), holders of options shall be treated as though they held the same number of shares of common stock that are subject to such options; however, if as result of the transaction stockholders of the company continue to hold their shares and are not entitled to any additional or other consideration, the options shall not be affected by the transaction. Adjustment . Subject to any required action by stockholders of the Company, in the event of any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of our common stock resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of the shares of common stock or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of common stock that is effected without receipt of consideration by us, our board of directors will make adjustments as it deems appropriate to prevent the enlargement or dilution or rights with respect to the number of shares of common stock available for grant under the 2010 Plan, the number of shares of common stock subject to options, and the exercise price of options. In the event of any other change in capitalization or corporate change not described in this paragraph or above under Corporate transactions, or if the stock of an affiliate of the company is publicly traded, our board of directors shall make such adjustments as it deems appropriate in the number, kind of shares subject to outstanding options, and exercise price of outstanding options to prevent a dilution or enlargement of rights. Amendment . Our board of directors may amend the 2010 Plan or outstanding awards, except that such an amendment may not impair or adversely affect a participants rights under the award without the participants written consent. Our board of directors may not grant any awards under the plan on or after the August 30, 2020. 114 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Agreements with TPG and Management In connection with the Merger, we entered into various agreements with TPG and members of our management. These include a stockholders agreement, a registration rights agreement, a transaction and monitoring fee letter with TPG, and an indemnification agreement with TPG, as well as a management stockholders agreement. These and related arrangements are described below. Transaction and Monitoring Fee Letter Pursuant to our transaction and monitoring fee letter agreement with TPG, we retained TPG to provide certain management, consulting and financial services to us, when and as requested by us. We agreed to pay TPG a monitoring fee equal to 2% of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the indenture that governed our Senior Secured Notes). The monitoring fee is payable in quarterly installments in arrears at the end of each fiscal quarter. From time to time we also pay additional fees to TPG in connection with equity financing and acquisition transactions, among other things, in an amount equal to 1% of the total transaction value of each such transaction. In connection with this offering, TPG will be entitled to receive, on its request and in lieu of any continuing payment of the monitoring fee, an aggregate termination fee of $12.5 million. We paid TPG a total of $5.8 million, $7.4 million and $4.6 million in aggregate fees, respectively, in fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011. We also incurred $580,200 in aggregate fees to TPG in the first quarter of 2014 and paid a $13.5 million transaction fee following the end of the first quarter in connection with the acquisitions of Terrys Tire and Hercules. Stockholders Agreement Our stockholders agreement with TPG and certain co-investors contains agreements among the parties with respect to the election of directors, preemptive rights, rights of first refusal and first offer upon disposition of shares, permitted transferees, tag along rights, drag along rights and actions requiring the approval of stockholders. In connection with this offering, certain of the provisions in the stockholders agreement are likely to be terminated or amended. Registration Rights Agreement Our registration rights agreement with TPG and certain co-investors provides TPG with demand registration rights in respect of any shares of common stock it holds, subject to certain conditions. In addition, in the event that we register additional shares of common stock for sale to the public following the completion of this offering, we will be required to give notice of such registration to the parties thereto, and, subject to certain limitations, include shares of common stock held by them in such registration. TPGs co-investors have similar piggyback rights in the event we register shares of common stock held by TPG for sale to the public following the completion of this offering. The agreement includes customary indemnification provisions in favor of TPG and the co-investors, any person who is or might be deemed a control person (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) and related parties against certain losses and liabilities (including reasonable costs of investigation and legal expenses) arising out of or based upon any filing or other disclosure made by us under the securities laws relating to any such registration. In connection with this offering, certain of the provisions in the registration rights agreement may be amended. Indemnification Agreement with TPG Pursuant to our indemnification agreement with TPG, including the TPG funds invested in us and their respective affiliates, we agree to indemnify TPG against liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by TPG arising out of or in connection with securities offerings, including liabilities under the securities laws, actions or failures to act by us or our affiliates generally, or the performance by TPG of services under the transaction and monitoring fee agreement described above. 115 Management Stockholders Agreement We are party to a stockholders agreement with certain members of management who were employed by us at the time of the Merger and other members of management have joined the agreement since the Merger. This agreement provides for certain Company call rights with respect to shares held by management stockholders, drag along rights, tag along rights, lock-up restrictions and registration rights. In connection with this offering, other than with respect to lock-up restrictions and registration rights, the material provisions of this agreement will terminate in accordance with their terms. Related Party Transactions Policy In connection with this offering, we have adopted a policy with respect to the review, approval and ratification of related party transactions. Under the policy, our audit committee is responsible for reviewing and approving related party transactions. In the course of its review and approval of related party transactions, our audit committee will consider the relevant facts and circumstances to decide whether to approve such transactions. Related party transactions must be approved or ratified by the audit committee based on full information about the proposed transaction and the related partys interest. We did not have a written policy regarding the review and approval of related party transactions immediately prior to this offering. Nevertheless, with respect to such transactions, it was our policy for our board of directors to consider the nature of and business reason for such transactions, how the terms of such transactions compared to those which might be obtained from unaffiliated third parties and whether such transactions were otherwise fair to and in the best interests of, or not contrary to, our best interests. 116 PRINCIPAL AND SELLING STOCKHOLDERS The following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of June 1, 2014 for (a) each person, or group of affiliated persons, known by us to own beneficially more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock, (b) each member of our board of directors, (c) each of our named executive officers, (d) all of our directors and executive officers as a group, and (e) each other selling stockholder. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with SEC rules. The information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. In general, under these rules a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise has or shares voting power or investment power with respect to such security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of such security within 60 days. To our knowledge, except as otherwise indicated, and subject to applicable community property laws, the persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock held by that person. The percentage of shares beneficially owned is computed on the basis of 767,501,736 shares of our common stock outstanding as of June 1, 2014. Shares of our common stock that a person has the right to acquire within 60 days of June 1, 2014 are deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of such persons holdings, but are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person, except with respect to the percentage ownership of all directors and executive officers as a group. Unless otherwise indicated below, the address for each beneficial owner listed is c/o ATD Corporation, 12200 Herbert Wayne Court, Suite 150, Huntersville, North Carolina 28078.

We refer you to the exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part for copies of agreements governing the indebtedness described below. ABL Facility On January 31, 2014, in connection with the Hercules acquisition, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement which provides for (i) U.S. revolving credit commitments of $850.0 million (of which up to $50.0 million can be utilized in the form of commercial and standby letters of credit), subject to the borrowing base under the U.S. ABL Facility and (ii) Canadian revolving credit commitments of $125.0 million (of which up to $10.0 million can be utilized in the form of commercial and standby letters of credit), subject to the borrowing base under the Canadian ABL Facility and the ABL Facility. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides the U.S. borrowers under the agreement with a first-in last out facility, the U.S. FILO Facility, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $80.0 million, subject to a borrowing base specific thereto and the Canadian borrowers under the agreement with a first-in last out facility, the Canadian FILO Facility, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $15.0 million, subject to a borrowing base specific thereto. The U.S. ABL Facility provides for revolving loans available to ATDI, its 100% owned subsidiary Am-Pac Tire Dist. Inc., Hercules and any other U.S. subsidiary that we designate in the future in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The Canadian ABL Facility provides for revolving loans available to TriCan, RTD and WTD and any other Canadian subsidiaries that we designate in the future in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Provided that no default or event of default then exists or would arise therefrom, we have the option to request that the ABL Facility be increased by an amount not to exceed $200.0 million (up to $50.0 million of which may be allocated to the Canadian ABL Facility), subject to certain rights of the administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing banks with respect to the lenders providing commitments for such increase. The maturity date for the ABL Facility is November 16, 2017, provided that if on March 1, 2017, either (i) more than $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of ATDIs Senior Secured Notes remains outstanding with a scheduled maturity date which is earlier than 91 days after November 16, 2017 or (ii) any principal amount of ATDIs Senior Secured Notes remains outstanding with a scheduled maturity date which is earlier than 91 days after November 16, 2017 and excess availability under the ABL Facility is less than 12.5% of the aggregate revolving commitments, then the maturity date will be March 1, 2017. The maturity date for the FILO Facility is the date that is 36 months from January 31, 2014. As of April 5, 2014, we had $596.0 million outstanding under the U.S. ABL Facility. In addition, we had certain letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate amount of $8.4 million, leaving $209.9 million available for additional borrowings under the U.S. ABL Facility. The outstanding balance of the Canadian ABL Facility at April 5, 2014 was $42.1 million, leaving $38.0 million available for additional borrowings. As of April 5, 2014, the outstanding balance of the U.S. FILO Facility was $74.1 million and the outstanding balance of the Canadian FILO Facility was $8.5 million. Borrowings under the U.S. ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) an Adjusted LIBOR rate determined by reference to LIBOR, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, plus an applicable margin of 2.0% as of April 5, 2014 or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime commercial lending rate published by the Bank of America, N.A. as its prime rate for commercial loans, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (3) the one month-Adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.0% per annum, plus an applicable margin of 1.0% as of April 5, 2014.

(acting through its Canada branch) as its prime rate, (2) the sum of 1/2 of 1% plus the Canadian overnight rate and (3) the sum of 1% plus the rate of interest per annum equal to the average rate applicable to Canadian Dollar bankers acceptances as published by Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service for a 30 day interest period, plus an applicable margin of 1.0% as of April 5, 2014, (c) a rate of interest per annum equal to the average rate applicable to Canadian Dollar bankers acceptances having an identical or comparable term as the proposed loan amount displayed and identified as such on the display referred to as the CDOR Page of Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service as at approximately 10:00 a.m. Toronto time on such day, plus an applicable margin of 2.0% as of April 5, 2014 or (d) an Adjusted LIBOR rate determined by reference to LIBOR, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, plus an applicable margin of 2.0% as of April 5, 2014. The applicable margins under the Canadian ABL Facility are subject to step ups and step downs based on average excess borrowing availability under the ABL Facility.

The applicable margins under the U.S. FILO Facility are subject to step ups and step downs based on average excess borrowing availability under the ABL Facility. Borrowings under the Canadian FILO Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either (a) a Canadian base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the base rate as published by Bank of America, N.A. (acting through its Canada branch) as its base rate, (2) the federal funds rate effective plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (3) the one month-LIBOR rate plus 1.0% per annum, plus an applicable margin of 2.5% as of April 5, 2014, (b) a Canadian prime rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate as published by Bank of America, N.A. (acting through its Canada branch) as its prime rate, (2) the sum of 1/2 of 1% plus the Canadian overnight rate and (3) the sum of 1% plus the rate of interest per annum equal to the average rate applicable to Canadian Dollar bankers acceptances as published by Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service for a 30 day interest period, plus an applicable margin of 2.5% as of April 5, 2014, (c) a rate of interest per annum equal to the average rate applicable to Canadian Dollar bankers acceptances having an identical or comparable term as the proposed loan amount displayed and identified as such on the display referred to as the CDOR Page of Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service as at approximately 10:00 a.m. Toronto time on such day, plus an applicable margin of 3.5% as of April 5, 2014 or (d) an Adjusted LIBOR rate determined by reference to LIBOR, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, plus an applicable margin of 3.5% as of April 5, 2014. The applicable margins under the Canadian FILO Facility are subject to step ups and step downs based on average excess borrowing availability under the ABL Facility. The U.S. and Canadian borrowing base at any time equals the sum (subject to certain reserves and other adjustments) of:  85% of eligible accounts receivable of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable; plus  The lesser of (a) 70% of the lesser of cost or fair market value of eligible tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable, and (b) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable; plus  The lesser of (a) 50% of the lower of cost or market value of eligible non-tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable, and (b) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible non-tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, applicable. 120 The U.S. FILO and the Canadian FILO borrowing base at any time equals the sum (subject to certain reserves and other adjustments) of:  5% of eligible accounts receivable of the U.S or Canadian. loan parties, as applicable; plus  10.0% of the net orderly liquidation value of the eligible tire and non-tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable. All obligations under the U.S. ABL Facility and the U.S. FILO Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and substantially all of ATDIs existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned domestic material restricted subsidiaries, other than Tire Pros Francorp. The Canadian ABL Facility and the Canadian FILO Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by the U.S. loan parties, TriCan, RTD, WTD and any future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned, material restricted Canadian subsidiaries. Obligations under the U.S. ABL Facility and the U.S. FILO Facility are secured by a first-priority lien on inventory, accounts receivable and related assets and a second-priority lien on substantially all other assets of the U.S. loan parties, subject to certain exceptions. Obligations under the Canadian ABL Facility and the Canadian FILO Facility are secured by a first-priority lien on inventory, accounts receivable and related assets and a second-priority lien on substantially all other assets of the U.S. loan parties and the Canadian loan parties, subject to certain exceptions. The ABL Facility and the FILO Facility contain customary covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, enter into guarantees, enter into certain mergers, make certain loans and investments, dispose of assets, prepay certain debt, declare dividends, modify certain material agreements, enter into transactions with affiliates or change our fiscal year. If the amount available for additional borrowings under the ABL Facility is less than the greater of (a) 10.0% of the lesser of (x) the aggregate commitments under the ABL Facility and (y) the aggregate borrowing base and (b) $25.0 million, then we would be subject to an additional covenant requiring us to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. As of April 5, 2014, our additional borrowing availability under the ABL Facility was above the required amount and we were therefore not subject to the additional covenants. Senior Secured Term Loan In connection with the acquisition of Terrys Tire, on March 28, 2014, ATDI entered into a credit agreement that provided for the Term Loan. The Term Loan was issued at a discount of 0.25% which, combined with certain debt issuance costs paid at closing, resulted in net proceeds of approximately $290.9 million. The Term Loan will accrete based on an effective interest rate of 6% to an aggregate accreted value of $300.0 million, the full principal amount at maturity. The net proceeds from the Term Loan were used to finance a portion of the Terrys Tire purchase price. The maturity date for the Term Loan is June 1, 2018. Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, initially, either (a) a Eurodollar rate determined by reference to LIBOR, plus an applicable margin of 4.75% at April 5, 2014 or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (2) the prime commercial lending rate published by the Bank of America, N.A. as its prime rate for commercial loans and (3) the one month Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin of 3.75% as of April 5, 2014. The Eurodollar rate is subject to an interest rate floor of 1.0%. The applicable margins under the Term Loan are subject to a step down based on a consolidated net leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement for the Term Loan. All obligations under the Term Loan are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and, subject to certain customary exceptions, all of ATDIs existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned domestic material subsidiaries. Obligations under the Term Loan are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all property, assets and capital stock of ATDI except accounts receivable, inventory and related intangible assets and a second-priority lien on all accounts receivable and related intangible assets. 121 The Term Loan contains customary covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional debt, create liens, enter into guarantees, enter into certain mergers, make certain loans and investments, dispose of assets, prepay certain debt, declare dividends, modify certain material agreements, enter into transactions with affiliates, change the nature of our business or change our fiscal year. Subject to certain exceptions, we are required to repay the Term Loan in certain circumstances, including with 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% and 0%, as applicable, subject to attaining certain senior secured net leverage ratios) of our annual excess cash flow, as defined in the Term Loan agreement. The Term Loan also contains repayment provisions related to non-ordinary course asset or property sales when certain conditions are met, and related to the incurrence of debt that is not permitted under the credit agreement or incurred to refinance all or any portion of the Term Loan. On June 16, 2014, we amended our credit agreement relating to our senior secured term loan facility to borrow an additional $340 million on the same terms as our existing Term Loan. Pursuant to the amendment, until August 15, 2014, we also have the right to borrow up to an additional $80 million on the same terms as our existing Term Loan. The proceeds from these additional borrowings were or will be used to redeem all amounts outstanding under our Senior Secured Notes and pay related fees and expenses, as well as for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes, including the financing of potential future acquisitions. Senior Subordinated Notes In connection with the consummation of the Hercules acquisition, on January 31, 2014, ATDI completed the sale to certain purchasers of the Additional Senior Subordinated Notes. The net proceeds to ATDI from the sale of the Additional Senior Subordinated Notes were approximately $221.1 million. The Additional Senior Subordinated Notes were issued pursuant to the Seventh Supplemental Indenture to the Senior Subordinated Indenture. The Additional Senior Subordinated Notes have identical terms to the Initial Subordinated Notes, except the Additional Senior Subordinated Notes accrue interest from January 31, 2014. The Additional Senior Subordinated Notes and the Initial Subordinated Notes, as defined below, are treated as a single class of securities for all purposes under the Subordinated Indenture. However, the Additional Senior Subordinated Notes were issued with separate CUSIP numbers from the Initial Subordinated Notes and are not fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the Initial Subordinated Notes. Interest on the Additional Senior Subordinated Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2014. The Additional Senior Subordinated Notes will mature on June 1, 2018. On May 28, 2010, ATDI issued $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Notes due June 1, 2018, the Initial Subordinated Notes. Interest on the Initial Subordinated Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2010. The Senior Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at any time at the option of ATDI, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price of 104.0% of the principal amount being redeemed if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2013 and May 31, 2014, 102.0% of the principal amount being redeemed if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2014 and May 31, 2015 and 100.0% of the principal amount being redeemed if the redemption date occurs thereafter. The Senior Subordinated Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and substantially all of ATDIs existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned domestic material restricted subsidiaries, other than Tire Pros Francorp, subject to certain exceptions. The indenture governing the Senior Subordinated Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limits ATDIs ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to 122 incur additional debt or issue preferred stock; pay certain dividends or make certain distributions in respect of ATDIs capital stock or repurchase or redeem ATDIs capital stock; make certain loans, investments or other restricted payments; place restrictions on the ability of certain of ATDIs subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to ATDI; transfer or sell certain assets; guarantee indebtedness or incur certain other contingent obligations; incur certain liens without securing the Senior Subordinated Notes; consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of ATDIs assets; enter into certain transactions with ATDIs affiliates; and designate ATDIs subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. 123 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK General Upon completion of this offering, our authorized capital stock will consist of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. The following description of our capital stock is intended as a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws to be in effect at the closing of this offering, which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, and to the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Common Stock Dividend rights . Subject to preferences that may apply to shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, holders of outstanding shares of common stock will be entitled to receive dividends out of assets legally available at the times and in the amounts as the board of directors may determine from time to time. See Dividend Policy. Voting rights . Each outstanding share of common stock will be entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Holders of shares of our common stock will have no cumulative voting rights. Preemptive rights . Our common stock will not be entitled to preemptive or other similar subscription rights to purchase any of our securities. Conversion or redemption rights . Our common stock will be neither convertible nor redeemable. Liquidation rights . Upon our liquidation, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to receive pro rata our assets that are legally available for distribution, after payment of all debts and other liabilities and subject to the prior rights of any holders of preferred stock then outstanding. Preferred Stock Our board of directors may, without further action by our stockholders, from time to time, direct the issuance of shares of preferred stock in series and may, at the time of issuance, determine the designations, powers, preferences, privileges and relative participating, optional or special rights, as well as the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of the common stock. Satisfaction of any dividend preferences of outstanding shares of preferred stock would reduce the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends on shares of our common stock. Holders of shares of preferred stock may be entitled to receive a preference payment in the event of our liquidation before any payment is made to the holders of shares of our common stock. Under certain circumstances, the issuance of shares of preferred stock may render more difficult or tend to discourage a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our securities or the removal of incumbent management. Upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors then in office, our board of directors, without stockholder approval, may issue shares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights which could adversely affect the holders of shares of our common stock and the market value of our common stock. Upon consummation of this offering, there will be no shares of preferred stock outstanding, and we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock. Anti-takeover Effects of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws Our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that may delay, defer or discourage another party from acquiring control of us. We expect that these provisions will discourage coercive takeover practices or inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire 124 control of us to first negotiate with the board of directors, which we believe may result in an improvement of the terms of any such acquisition in favor of our stockholders. However, they may also discourage acquisitions that some stockholders may favor. Corporate Opportunities Our certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interest or expectancy in the business opportunities of TPG and of its officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members, partners, affiliates and subsidiaries and each such party shall not have any obligation to offer us those opportunities unless presented to one of our directors or officers in his or her capacity as a director or officer. Limitations on Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers Our certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and requires that we will provide them with customary indemnification. We expect to enter into customary indemnification agreements with each of our executive officers and directors that provide them, in general, with customary indemnification in connection with their service to us or on our behalf. We also maintain officers and directors liability insurance that insures against liabilities that our officers and directors may incur in such capacities.

As described below, only a limited number of shares currently outstanding will be available for sale immediately after this offering due to contractual and legal restrictions on resale. Nevertheless, future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, in the public market after this offering, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the prevailing market price for our common stock to fall or impair our ability to raise capital through sales of our equity securities. Upon the closing of this offering, we will have outstanding shares of our common stock, after giving effect to the issuance of shares of our common stock in this offering, assuming no exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares and no exercise of options outstanding as of , 2014. Of the shares that will be outstanding immediately after the closing of this offering, we expect that the shares to be sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act unless purchased by our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Shares purchased by our affiliates may not be resold except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from registration, including the safe harbor under Rule 144 of the Securities Act described below. In addition, following this offering, shares of common stock issuable pursuant to awards granted under certain of our equity plans that are covered by a registration statement on Form S-8 will be freely tradable in the public market, subject to certain contractual and legal restrictions described below. The remaining shares of our common stock outstanding after this offering will be restricted securities, as that term is defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act, and we expect that substantially all of these restricted securities will be subject to the lock-up agreements described below. These restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if the sale is registered or pursuant to an exemption from registration, such as the safe harbor provided by Rule 144. Lock-up Agreements We and each of our directors, executive officers and certain other stockholders, who collectively own shares of our common stock following this offering, have agreed that, without the prior written consent of certain of the underwriters, we and they will not, subject to limited exceptions, directly or indirectly sell or dispose of any shares of common stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of common stock for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus, unless extended pursuant to its terms. The lock-up restrictions and specified exceptions are described in more detail under Underwriting. Rule 144 In general, under Rule 144, beginning 90 days after the date of this prospectus, any person who is not our affiliate and has held their shares for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner other than one of our affiliates, may sell shares without restriction, subject to the availability of current public information about us. In addition, under Rule 144, any person who is not our affiliate and has not been our affiliate at any time during the preceding three months and has held their shares for at least one year, including the holding period of any prior owner other than one of our affiliates, would be entitled to sell an unlimited number of shares immediately upon the closing of this offering without regard to whether current public information about us is available. Beginning 90 days after the date of this prospectus, a person who is our affiliate or who was our affiliate at any time during the preceding three months and who has beneficially owned restricted securities for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner other than one of our affiliates, is entitled to sell a 126 number of shares within any three-month period that does not exceed the greater of: (i) 1% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding, which will equal approximately shares immediately after this offering; and (ii) the average weekly trading volume of our common stock on during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale. Sales under Rule 144 by our affiliates are also subject to certain manner of sale provisions, notice requirements and the availability of current public information about us. Rule 701 In general, under Rule 701 under the Securities Act, beginning 90 days after we become subject to the public company reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, any of our employees, directors, officers, consultants or advisors who acquired shares of common stock from us in connection with a written compensatory stock or option plan or other written agreement in compliance with Rule 701 is entitled to sell such shares in reliance on Rule 144 but without compliance with certain of the requirements contained in Rule 144. Accordingly, subject to any applicable lock-up agreements, beginning 90 days after we become subject to the public company reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, under Rule 701 persons who are not our affiliates may resell those shares without complying with the minimum holding period or public information requirements of Rule 144, and persons who are our affiliates may resell those shares without compliance with Rule 144s minimum holding period requirements. Equity Incentive Plans Following this offering, we intend to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock that are subject to outstanding options and other awards issuable pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Shares covered by such registration statement will be available for sale in the open market following its effective date, subject to certain Rule 144 limitations applicable to affiliates and the terms of lock-up agreements applicable to those shares. Registration Rights Subject to the lock-up agreements described above, certain holders of our common stock may demand that we register the sale of their shares under the Securities Act or, if we file another registration statement under the Securities Act other than a Form S-8 covering securities issuable under our equity plans or on Form S-4, may elect to include their shares of common stock in such registration. Following such registered sales, the shares will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, unless held by our affiliates. See Certain Relationships and Related Party TransactionsStockholders Agreement. 127 MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS The following is a summary of material U.S. federal income and estate tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of our common stock issued pursuant to this offering by Non-U.S. Holders (defined below). This summary does not purport to be a complete analysis of all the potential tax considerations relevant to Non-U.S. Holders of shares of our common stock. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code), the Treasury regulations promulgated or proposed thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary assumes that shares of our common stock are held by a Non-U.S. Holder as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code (generally, property held for investment). This summary does not purport to deal with all aspects of U.S. federal income and estate taxation that might be relevant to particular Non-U.S. Holders in light of their particular investment circumstances or status, nor does it address specific tax considerations that may be relevant to particular persons who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, financial institutions, broker-dealers, insurance companies, partnerships or other pass-through entities, certain U.S. expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States, tax-exempt organizations, pension plans, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, persons in special situations, such as those who have elected to mark securities to market or those who hold shares of our common stock as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction, synthetic security or other integrated investment, persons that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, or holders subject to the alternative minimum tax or the 3.8% tax on net investment income). In addition, except as explicitly addressed herein with respect to estate tax, this summary does not address certain estate and any gift tax considerations or considerations arising under the tax laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction. For purposes of this summary, a Non-U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is an individual, corporation, estate or trust other than:  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;  a corporation, or any other organization taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  an estate, the income of which is included in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or  a trust if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trusts administration and one or more United States persons (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) have the authority to control all of the trusts substantial decisions or (2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. A modified definition of Non-U.S. Holder applies for U.S. federal estate tax purposes (as discussed below). If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of persons treated as its partners for U.S. federal income tax purposes will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and other entities that are classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and persons holding our common 128 stock through a partnership or other entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes are urged to consult their own tax advisors. There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences described herein, and we have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, a ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel with respect to the U.S. federal income or estate tax consequences to a Non-U.S. Holder of the purchase, ownership or disposition of shares of our common stock. THIS SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE TAX ADVICE. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME AND ESTATE TAXATION AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS. Distributions on Shares of our Common Stock As discussed under Dividend Policy above, we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In the event that we do make a distribution of cash or property with respect to shares of our common stock, any such distributions generally will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, and will be subject to withholding as described in the next paragraph below. If a distribution exceeds our current or accumulated earnings and profits, the excess will be treated as a tax-free return of the Non-U.S. Holders investment, up to such holders adjusted tax basis in its shares of our common stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as capital gain, subject to the tax treatment described below in Gain on Sale, Exchange or other Taxable Disposition of our Common Stock. Any distribution described in this paragraph would also be subject to the discussion below in Additional Withholding and Information Reporting Requirements for Shares of our Common Stock Held by or through Non-U.S. Entities. Any dividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder with respect to shares of our common stock generally will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax unless such Non-U.S. Holder provides us or our agent, as the case may be, with an appropriate IRS Form W-8, such as:  IRS Form W-8BEN (or successor form) or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or successor form) certifying, under penalties of perjury, that such Non-U.S. Holder is entitled to a reduction in withholding under an applicable income tax treaty; or  IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form) certifying, under penalties of perjury, that a dividend paid on shares of our common stock is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with conduct of a trade or business in the United States of the Non-U.S. Holder (in which case such dividend generally will be subject to regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates on a net income basis as described below). The certifications described above must be provided to us or our agent prior to the payment of dividends and must be updated periodically. The certification also may require a Non-U.S. Holder that provides an IRS form or that claims treaty benefits to provide its U.S. taxpayer identification number. Special certification and other requirements apply in the case of certain Non-U.S. Holders that are intermediaries or pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each Non-U.S. Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor about the specific methods for satisfying these requirements. A claim for exemption will not be valid if the person receiving the applicable form has actual knowledge or reason to know that the statements on the form are false. 129 If dividends are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States of the Non-U.S. Holder (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), the Non-U.S. Holder, although exempt from the withholding tax described above (provided that the certifications described above are satisfied), will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such dividends on a net income basis in the same manner as if it were a resident of the United States. In addition, if such Non-U.S. Holder is taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Non-U.S. Holder may be subject to an additional branch profits tax equal to 30% of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. Non-U.S. Holders that do not timely provide us or our agent with the required certification, but which are eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to an applicable income tax treaty may obtain a refund or credit of any excess amount withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Gain on Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Shares of our Common Stock Subject to the discussion below under Additional Withholding and Information Reporting Requirements for Shares of our Common Stock Held by or through Non-U.S. Entities, in general, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized upon such holders sale, exchange or other disposition of shares of our common stock unless (i) such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition, and certain other conditions are met, (ii) we are or have been a United States real property holding corporation, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code (a USRPHC), at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the disposition and the Non-U.S. Holders holding period with respect to the applicable shares of our common stock (the relevant period), or (iii) such gain is effectively connected with the conduct by such Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States). If the first exception applies, the Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise) on the amount by which such Non-U.S. Holders capital gains allocable to U.S. sources exceed capital losses allocable to U.S. sources during the taxable year of the disposition. With respect to the second exception above, although there can be no assurance, we believe we are not, and we do not currently anticipate becoming, a USRPHC. However, because the determination of whether we are a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of our U.S. real property relative to the fair market value of other business assets, there can be no assurance that we are not currently or will not become a USRPHC in the future. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC only if the fair market value of its United States real property interests (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus certain other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. Even if we are or become a USRPHC, a Non-U.S. Holder would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our common stock by reason of our status as a USRPHC so long as (a) our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 897(c)(3)) during the calendar year in which such sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our common stock occurs and (b) such Non-U.S. Holder does not own and is not deemed to own (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than 5% of our common stock at any time during the relevant period. If we are a USRPHC and the requirements of (a) or (b) are not met, gain on the disposition of shares of our common stock generally will be taxed in the same manner as gain that is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, except that the branch profits tax will not apply. Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if we are, or were to become, a USRPHC. 130 If the third exception applies, the Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S federal income tax on a net income basis with respect to such gain in the same manner as if such holder were a resident of the United States, unless otherwise provided in an applicable income tax treaty, and a Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation for U.S federal income tax purposes may also be subject to a branch profits tax on its effectively connected earnings and profits at a rate of 30%, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. Additional Withholding and Information Reporting Requirements for Shares of our Common Stock Held by or through Non-U.S. Entities Legislation enacted in March 2010 and related Treasury guidance (commonly referred to as FATCA) generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on payments to certain non-U.S. entities (including certain intermediaries), including dividends on and the gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our common stock unless such persons comply with a complicated U.S. information reporting, disclosures and certification regime. This new regime requires, among other things, a broad class of persons to enter into agreements with the IRS to obtain, disclose and report information about their investors and account holders. This new regime and its requirements are different from and in addition to the certification requirements described elsewhere in this discussion. As currently proposed, the FATCA withholding rules would apply to certain payments, including dividend payments on our common stock, if any, paid after June 30, 2014, and gross proceeds from the sale or other dispositions of our common stock paid after December 31, 2016. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible impact of these rules on their investment in our common stock, and the entities through which they hold our common stock, including, without limitation, the process and deadlines for meeting the applicable requirements to prevent the imposition of this 30% withholding tax under FATCA. Backup Withholding and Information Reporting We must report annually to the IRS and to each Non-U.S. Holder the gross amount of the distributions on shares of our common stock paid to such holder and the tax withheld, if any, with respect to such distributions. These information reporting requirements apply even if withholding was not required. In addition to the requirements described above under Additional Withholding and Information Reporting Requirements for Shares of our Common Stock Held by or through Non-U.S. Entities, a Non-U.S. Holder may have to comply with specific certification procedures to establish that the holder is not a United States person (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) or otherwise establish an exemption in order to avoid backup withholding at the applicable rate with respect to dividends on our common stock. Dividends paid to Non-U.S. Holders subject to the U.S. federal withholding tax, as described above In Distributions on Shares of our Common Stock, generally will be exempt from U.S. backup withholding. Information reporting and backup withholding will generally apply to the payment of the proceeds of a disposition of shares of our common stock by a Non-U.S. Holder effected by or through the U.S. office of any broker, U.S. or non-U.S., unless the holder certifies that it is not a United States person (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) and satisfies certain other requirements, or otherwise establishes an exemption. For information reporting purposes, dispositions effected through a non-U.S. office of a broker with substantial U.S. ownership or operations generally will be treated in a manner similar to dispositions effected through a U.S. office of a broker, and dispositions otherwise effected through a non-U.S. office generally will not be subject to information reporting. Generally, backup withholding will not apply to a payment of disposition proceeds to a Non-U.S. Holder where the transaction is effected through a non-U.S. office of a U.S. broker or non-U.S. office of a non-U.S broker. Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules to them. Copies of information returns may be made available to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is incorporated, under the provisions of a specific treaty or agreement. 131 Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment made to a Non-U.S. Holder can be refunded or credited against such Non-U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that an appropriate claim is timely filed with the IRS. Federal estate tax Shares of our common stock held (or treated as held) by an individual who is not a U.S. citizen or resident (as defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes) at the time of such individuals death will be included in such individuals gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise. 132 UNDERWRITING (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST) Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are acting as representatives of each of the underwriters named below. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in an underwriting agreement among us, the selling stockholders and the underwriters, we and the selling stockholders have agreed to sell to the underwriters, and each of the underwriters has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from us and the selling stockholders, the number of shares of common stock set forth opposite its name below. Underwriter Number of Shares Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated Deutsche Bank Securities Inc Goldman, Sachs & Co. Barclays Capital Inc. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC UBS Securities LLC TPG Capital BD, LLC RBC Capital Markets, LLC SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Total Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the underwriting agreement, the underwriters have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the shares sold under the underwriting agreement if any of these shares are purchased. If an underwriter defaults, the underwriting agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the nondefaulting underwriters may be increased or the underwriting agreement may be terminated. We and the selling stockholders have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the underwriters may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. The underwriters are offering the shares, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by them, subject to approval of legal matters by their counsel, including the validity of the shares, and other conditions contained in the underwriting agreement, such as the receipt by the underwriters of officers certificates and legal opinions. The underwriters reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part. Commissions and Discounts The representatives have advised us and the selling stockholders that the underwriters propose initially to offer the shares to the public at the public offering price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and to dealers at that price less a concession not in excess of $ per share. After the initial offering, the public offering price, concession or any other term of the offering may be changed. Sales of shares made outside of the United States may be made by affiliates of the underwriters. The following table shows the public offering price, underwriting discount and proceeds before expenses to us and the selling stockholders. The information assumes either no exercise or full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. Per Share Without Option With Option Public offering price $ $ $ Underwriting discount $ $ $ Proceeds, before expenses, to ATD $ $ $ Proceeds, before expenses, to the selling stockholders $ $ $ The expenses of the offering, not including the underwriting discount, are estimated at $ and are payable by us. 133 Option to Purchase Additional Shares We and the selling stockholders have granted an option to the underwriters, exercisable for 30 days after the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to additional shares at the public offering price, less the underwriting discount. If the underwriters exercise this option, each will be obligated, subject to conditions contained in the underwriting agreement, to purchase a number of additional shares proportionate to that underwriters initial amount reflected in the above table. No Sales of Similar Securities We and the selling stockholders, our executive officers and directors and our other existing security holders have agreed not to sell or transfer any common stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable for, exercisable for, or repayable with common stock, for 180 days after the date of this prospectus without first obtaining the written consent of certain of the underwriters. Specifically, we and these other persons have agreed, with certain limited exceptions, not to directly or indirectly  offer, pledge, sell or contract to sell any common stock,  sell any option or contract to purchase any common stock,  purchase any option or contract to sell any common stock,  grant any option, right or warrant for the sale of any common stock,  lend or otherwise dispose of or transfer any common stock,  request or demand that we file a registration statement related to the common stock, or  enter into any swap or other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, the economic consequence of ownership of any common stock whether any such swap or transaction is to be settled by delivery of shares or other securities, in cash or otherwise. This lock-up provision applies to common stock and to securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for or repayable with common stock. It also applies to common stock owned now or acquired later by the person executing the agreement or for which the person executing the agreement later acquires the power of disposition. In the event that either (x) during the last 17 days of the lock-up period referred to above, we issue an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to us occurs or (y) prior to the expiration of the lock-up period, we announce that we will release earnings results or become aware that material news or a material event will occur during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the lock-up period, the restrictions described above shall continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the occurrence of the material news or material event. Exchange Listing We expect the shares to be approved for listing on under the symbol  . In order to meet the requirements for listing on that exchange, the underwriters have undertaken to sell a minimum number of shares to a minimum number of beneficial owners as required by that exchange. Before this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. The initial public offering price will be determined through negotiations among us, the selling stockholders and the representatives. In addition to prevailing market conditions, the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price are  the valuation multiples of publicly traded companies that the representatives believe to be comparable to us, 134  our financial information,  the history of, and the prospects for, our company and the industry in which we compete,  an assessment of our management, its past and present operations, and the prospects for, and timing of, our future revenues,  the present state of our development,  the information set forth in this prospectus and otherwise available to the representatives,  the general condition of the securities markets at the time of the offering,  the above factors in relation to market values and various valuation measures of other companies engaged in activities similar to ours, and  other factors deemed relevant by the underwriters, the selling stockholders and us. An active trading market for the shares may not develop. It is also possible that after the offering the shares will not trade in the public market at or above the initial public offering price. The underwriters do not expect to sell more than 5% of the shares in the aggregate to accounts over which they exercise discretionary authority. Price Stabilization, Short Positions and Penalty Bids Until the distribution of the shares is completed, SEC rules may limit underwriters and selling group members from bidding for and purchasing our common stock. However, the representatives may engage in transactions that stabilize the price of the common stock, such as bids or purchases to peg, fix or maintain that price. In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell our common stock in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales and stabilizing transactions. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering. Covered short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters option to purchase additional shares described above. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the option granted to them. Naked short sales are sales in excess of such option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of our common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of shares of common stock made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering. The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions. Similar to other purchase transactions, the underwriters purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our common stock or preventing or retarding a 135 decline in the market price of our common stock. As a result, the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. The underwriters may conduct these transactions on , in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. Neither we nor any of the underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of our common stock. In addition, neither we nor any of the underwriters make any representation that the representatives will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Electronic Distribution In connection with the offering, certain of the underwriters or securities dealers may distribute prospectuses by electronic means, such as e-mail. Conflict of Interest Affiliates of TPG Capital BD, LLC, an underwriter of this offering, own in excess of 10% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Therefore, a conflict of interest is deemed to exist under FINRA Rule 5121(f)(5)(B). In addition, because the TPG Funds are affiliates of TPG Capital BD, LLC and, as selling stockholders, will receive more than 5% of the net proceeds of this offering, a conflict of interest is also deemed to exist under FINRA Rule 5121(f)(5)(C)(ii). Accordingly, this offering will be made in compliance with the applicable provisions of FINRA Rule 5121. In accordance with FINRA Rule 5121(c), no sales of the shares will be made to any discretionary account over which TPG Capital BD, LLC exercises discretion without the prior specific written approval of the account holder. However, no qualified independent underwriter is required because the underwriters primarily responsible for managing this offering are free of any conflict of interest. as that term is defined in the rule.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 16(b) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Charlotte, North Carolina June 16, 2014 F-4 ATD CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS In thousands, except share amounts December 28, 2013 December 29, 2012 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 35,760 $ 34,700 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,169 and $950 in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively 305,247 301,303 Inventories 772,733 721,672 Deferred income taxes 15,719 16,458 Income tax receivable 369 369 Assets held for sale 910 7,151 Other current assets 19,684 20,695 Total current assets 1,150,422 1,102,348 Property and equipment, net 147,856 129,882 Goodwill 504,333 483,143 Other intangible assets, net 713,294 738,698 Other assets 25,750 32,766 Total assets $ 2,541,655 $ 2,486,837 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 563,691 $ 502,221 Accrued expenses 45,116 42,988 Current maturities of long-term debt 564 493 Total current liabilities 609,371 545,702 Long-term debt 966,436 950,711 Deferred income taxes 268,432 283,009 Other liabilities 17,362 14,662 Commitments and contingencies (See Note 13) Stockholders equity: Common stock, par value $.01 per share; 2,000,000,000 shares authorized; 734,168,402 shares issued and outstanding 7,342 7,342 Additional paid-in capital 751,630 748,996 Accumulated earnings (deficit) (69,818 ) (63,442 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (9,100 ) (143 ) Total stockholders equity 680,054 692,753 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 2,541,655 $ 2,486,837 See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.

F-8 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Description of Company: ATD Corporation (also referred to herein as ATD Corp and formerly Accelerate Parent Corp.) is a Delaware corporation that indirectly owns 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of American Tire Distributors Holdings, Inc. (Holdings), a Delaware corporation. Holdings owns 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of American Tire Distributors, Inc. (ATDI), a Delaware corporation. ATD Corp has no significant assets or operations other than its ownership of ATDI. The operations of ATDI and its subsidiaries constitute the operations of ATD Corp presented under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Unless the context otherwise requires, Company herein refers to ATD Corp and its consolidated subsidiaries. In June 2014, the Company changed its name from Accelerate Parent Corp. to ATD Corporation. On May 28, 2010, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 20, 2010, the Company was acquired by TPG Capital, L.P. (TPG or the Sponsor) and certain co-investors (the Merger). The Company is primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of tires, custom wheels and accessories, and related tire supplies and tools, representing 97.4%, 2.0% and 0.6%, respectively, of our net sales. Operating as one operating and reportable segment through a network of 133 distribution centers, including three redistribution centers in the United States, the Company offers access to an extensive breadth and depth of inventory, representing approximately 40,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) to approximately 72,000 customers (approximately 64,000 in the U.S. and 8,000 in Canada). The Companys customer base is comprised primarily of independent tire dealers with the remainder of other customers representing various national and corporate accounts. The Company serves a majority of the contiguous United States as well as Canada. The Companys fiscal year is based on either a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to each December 31. Therefore, the financial results of 53-week fiscal years will not be exactly comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years. The fiscal years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 each contain operating results for 52 weeks. It should be noted that, prior to fiscal 2013, the Company and its TriCan Tire Distributors (TriCan) subsidiary had different year-end reporting dates. For fiscal 2012, TriCan had a calendar year-end reporting date of December 31. The impact from this difference on the consolidated financial statements was not material. TriCan converted to the Companys fiscal year reporting date during fiscal 2013. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: A summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements follows: Basis of Preparation The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidated operations of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) within the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC). In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the consolidated results for the periods presented. Certain changes in classification of amounts reported in prior years have been made to conform to the 2013 classification. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ATD Corp and its 100% owned subsidiaries. Partially-owned investments are accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. F-9 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are based on several factors including the facts and circumstances available at the time the estimates are made, historical experience, risk of loss, general economic conditions and trends, and the assessment of the probable future outcome. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in the statement of comprehensive income (loss) in the period that they are determined. Foreign currency translation All foreign currency denominated balance sheet accounts are translated at year end exchange rates and revenue and expense accounts are translated at weighted average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders equity. Transactional foreign currency gains and losses are included in other expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all deposits with an original maturity of three months or less and readily convertible cash to be cash equivalents in its consolidated financial statements. Outstanding checks are presented as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows because they are funded by drawing on the revolving credit facility as they are presented for payment. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the best estimate of probable loss inherent within the Companys accounts receivable balance. Estimates are based upon both the creditworthiness of specific customers and the overall probability of losses based upon an analysis of the overall aging of receivables as well as past collection trends and general economic conditions. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or fair market value and consist primarily of automotive tires, custom wheels, and related tire supply and tool products. The Company performs periodic assessments to determine the existence of obsolete, slow-moving and non-saleable inventories and records necessary provisions to reduce such inventories to net realizable value. A majority of the Companys tire vendors allow for the return of tire products, subject to certain limitations, specified in supply arrangements with the vendors. F-10 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting purposes, assets placed in service are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method at annual rates sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets less estimated salvage values over the assets estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their economic useful life or the related lease term. The range of useful lives used to depreciate property and equipment is as follows: Buildings 25 to 31 years Leasehold improvements 2 to 10 years Machinery and equipment 2 to 10 years Furniture and fixtures 3 to 8 years Internal use software 1 to 5 years Vehicles and other 3 to 6 years Major expenditures for replacements and significant improvements that increase asset values and extend useful lives are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance expenditures that do not extend the useful life of the asset are charged to expense as incurred. The carrying amounts of assets that are sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts in the year of disposal, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the statement of comprehensive income (loss). The Company capitalizes costs, including interest, incurred to develop or acquire internal-use software. These costs are capitalized subsequent to the preliminary project stage once specific criteria are met. Costs incurred in the preliminary project planning stage are expensed. Other costs, such as maintenance and training, are also expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested and reviewed annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or whenever there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than the carrying amount of the asset. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and determined using a two step process. The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed, wherein the reporting units carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value, impairment exists and must be recognized. Recoverability of other indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible assets to the estimated fair value of the respective intangible assets. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. F-11 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Intangible assets such as customer-related intangible assets and noncompete agreements with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line or accelerated basis over their estimated economic lives. The weighted-average useful lives approximate the following: Customer list 16 to 19 years Tradenames 1 to 7 years Noncompete agreements 1 to 5 years Favorable leases 4 to 6 years The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its intangible assets with finite useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs are expenditures associated with obtaining financings that are capitalized in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the term of the loans to which such costs relate. Amounts capitalized are recorded within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized to interest expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). At December 28, 2013, the unamortized balance of deferred financing costs was $16.3 million, which includes $1.1 million incurred to increase the borrowing capacity of the Companys Canadian ABL Facility and FILO Facility during fiscal 2013 (See Note 9 for additional information). At December 29, 2012, the unamortized balance of deferred financing costs was $19.7 million. Amortization for fiscal 2013, fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 was $4.5 million, $7.5 million and $4.8 million, respectively. Amortization for fiscal 2012 included $2.8 million related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with a lender that is not participating in the new syndication group. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities For derivative instruments, the Company applies FASB authoritative guidance which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. This statement requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met and that a company must formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment. Self Insurance The Company is self-insured with respect to employee health liability claims and maintains a large deductible program on both workers compensation and auto insurance. The Company has stop-loss insurance coverage for individual claims in excess of $0.3 million for employee health insurance and deductibles of $0.3 million on the workers compensation and auto on a per claim basis. Aggregate stop-loss limits for workers compensation and auto are $9.0 million. There is no aggregate stop-loss limit on employee health insurance. A reserve for liabilities associated with losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry as well as the Companys historical claims experience. F-12 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectability is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered. The Company recognizes revenue when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer, which is upon delivery under free on board (FOB) destination terms. The Company permits customers from time to time to return certain products, but there is no contractual right of return. The Company continuously monitors and tracks such returns and records an estimate of such future returns, which is based on historical experience and recent trends. In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit, on open accounts, to its customers after performing a credit analysis based on a number of financial and other criteria. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not normally require collateral; however, letters of credit and other security are occasionally required for certain new and existing customers. Customer Rebates The Company offers rebates to its customers under a number of different programs. These rebates are recorded in accordance with the accounting standards for consideration given by a vendor to a customer. The majority of these programs provide for the customer to receive rebates, generally in the form of a reduction in the related accounts receivable balance, when certain measures are achieved, generally related to the volume of product purchased from the Company. These rebates are recorded as a reduction of the related price of the product, which reduces the amount of revenue recorded. Throughout the year, the amount of rebates is estimated based on the expected level of purchases to be made by customers that participate in the rebate programs. These estimates are periodically revised to reflect rebates earned by customers based on actual purchases made. Manufacturer Rebates The Company receives rebates from its vendors under a number of different programs. These rebates are recorded in accordance with the accounting standards for cash consideration received from a vendor. Many of the vendor programs provide for the Company to receive rebates when any of a number of measures are achieved, generally related to the volume of purchases. These rebates are accounted for as a reduction to the price of the product, which reduces the carrying value of our inventory, and our cost of goods sold when product is sold. Throughout the year, the amount recognized for annual rebates is based on purchases management considers probable for the full year. These estimates are continually revised to reflect rebates earned based on actual purchase levels. Cooperative Advertising and Marketing Programs The Company participates in cooperative advertising and marketing programs (co-op) with its vendors. Co-op funds are provided to the Company generally based on the volume of purchases made with vendors that offer such programs. A portion of the funds received must be used for specific advertising and marketing expenditures incurred by the Company or its customers. The co-op funds received by the Company from its vendors are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards related to accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor, which requires that the Company record the funds received as a reduction of cost of sales or as an offset to specific costs incurred in selling the vendors products. The co-op funds that are provided to the Companys customers are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance related to accounting for cash consideration given by a vendor to a customer, which requires that the Company record the funds paid as a reduction of revenue since no separate identifiable benefit is received by the Company. F-13 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs In accordance with current accounting standards, the Company determined that shipping fees shall be reported on a gross basis. As a result, all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping fees represent revenues earned for the goods provided and therefore recorded within net sales in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). Handling costs include expenses incurred to store, move, and prepare products for shipment. The Company classifies these costs as selling, general and administrative expenses within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss), and includes a portion of internal costs such as salaries and overhead related to these activities. For fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company incurred $213.8 million, $171.1 million and $140.8 million, respectively, related to these expenses. Income Taxes The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. The provision is computed using the asset and liability method of accounting, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In addition, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in its judgment to be more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax items are expected to be realized or settled. The Company regularly reviews the recoverability of its deferred tax assets considering historic profitability, projected future taxable income, and timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences as well as the feasibility of our tax planning strategies. Where appropriate, a valuation allowance is recorded if available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes to valuation allowances are recognized in earnings in the period such determination is made. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon the technical merits, it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax impacts recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest impact that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2012, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment which amended the guidance on the annual impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill. The amended guidance will allow a company the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If, based on the qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is required. However, if a company concludes otherwise, quantitative impairment testing is not required. This new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance on December 30, 2012 (the first day of its 2013 fiscal year); however, the Company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2013. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income which amended the guidance for reporting reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The amended guidance requires an entity to report the effect of F-14 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is entirely reclassified to net income, as required by U.S. GAAP. For other amounts, that are not required by U.S. GAAP to be entirely reclassified to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference other disclosures that will provide additional detail concerning these amounts. The amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The Company adopted this guidance on December 30, 2012 and its adoption did not have an effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exits. ASU 2013-11 clarifies guidance and eliminates diversity in practice on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists at the reporting date. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2013 and subsequent interim periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. The standards core principle is that a company should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under todays guidance.

WTD operated two distribution centers serving over 2,300 customers. The acquisition of WTD strengthened the Companys market presence in the Southern Ontario region of Canada. The acquisition was completed on December 13, 2013 and was funded through cash on hand. The Company does not believe the acquisition of WTD is a material transaction, individually or when aggregated with the other non-material acquisition discussed herein, subject to the disclosures and supplemental pro forma information required by ASC 805 Business Combinations .

The acquisition of WTD was recorded using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations and non-controlling interest. The purchase price has been F-15 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS preliminarily allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair market value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. A majority of the net assets acquired relate to a customer list intangible asset, which had an acquisition date fair value of $4.4 million. The excess of the purchase price over the amounts allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities is included in goodwill, and amounted to $1.1 million. The premium in the purchase price paid for the acquisition of WTD reflects the anticipated realization of operational and cost synergies. As additional information is obtained about these assets and liabilities within the measurement period, the Company expects to refine its estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price more accurately. On August 30, 2013, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Tire Distributors, Inc. (TDI) to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of TDI. TDI operated one distribution center serving over 1,700 customers across Maryland and northeastern Virginia.

The Company does not believe the acquisition of TDI is a material transaction, individually or when aggregated with the other non-material acquisition discussed herein, subject to the disclosures and supplemental pro forma information required by ASC 805 Business Combinations . As a result, the information is not presented. The acquisition of TDI was recorded using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations and non-controlling interest. The purchase price has been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair market value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. A majority of the net assets acquired relate to a customer list intangible asset, which had an acquisition date fair value of $3.4 million. The excess of the purchase price over the amounts allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities is included in goodwill, and amounted to $2.4 million. The premium in the purchase price paid for the acquisition of TDI reflects the anticipated realization of operational and cost synergies. On March 22, 2013, TriCan and ATDI entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Regional Tire Holdings Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of the Province of Ontario (Holdco), Regional Tire Distributors Inc. (RTD), a corporation formed under the laws of the Province of Ontario and a 100% owned subsidiary of Holdco, and the shareholders of Holdco, pursuant to which TriCan agreed to acquire from the shareholders of Holdco all of the issued and outstanding shares of Holdco for a purchase price of $62.5 million. Holdco has no significant assets or operations, other than its ownership of RTD. The operations of RTD constitute the operations of Holdco. RTD is a wholesale distributor of tires, tire parts, tire accessories and related equipment in the Ontario and Atlantic provinces of Canada. The acquisition of RTD significantly expanded the Companys presence in the Ontario and Atlantic Provinces of Canada and complements the Companys current operations in Canada. The acquisition of RTD was completed on April 30, 2013 for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $64.9 million (the Adjusted Purchase Price) which includes initial working capital adjustments. The acquisition of RTD was funded by borrowings under the Companys ABL Facility and FILO Facility, as more fully described in Note 9. The Adjusted Purchase Price was subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including, but not limited to, the finalization of working capital adjustments. Of the $64.9 million Adjusted Purchase Price, $6.3 million is held in escrow pending the resolution of the post-closing adjustments and other escrow release conditions in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement and escrow agreement. During third quarter 2013, the Company and the shareholders of Holdco agreed on the post-closing working capital adjustments in accordance with the purchase agreement. This adjustment increased the Adjusted Purchase Price by $1.0 million to $65.9 million with a corresponding increase to goodwill of $1.0 million. F-16 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The acquisition of RTD was recorded using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with current accounting guidance for business combinations and non-controlling interest.

Our Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, our Credit Agreement) provides for (i) U.S. revolving credit commitments of $850.0 million (of which up to $50.0 million can be utilized in the form of commercial and standby letters of credit), subject to U.S. borrowing base availability (the U.S. ABL Facility) and (ii) Canadian revolving credit commitments of $100.0 million (of which up to $10.0 million can be utilized in the form of commercial and standby letters of credit), subject to Canadian borrowing base availability (the Canadian ABL Facility and, collectively with the U.S. ABL Facility, the ABL Facility). In addition, the Credit Agreement provides the U.S. borrowers under the agreement with a first-in last-out facility (the FILO Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $60.0 million, subject to a borrowing base specific thereto. The U.S. ABL Facility provides for revolving loans available to ATDI, its 100% owned subsidiary Am-Pac Tire F-25 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Dist. Inc. and any other U.S. subsidiary that the Company designates in the future in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The Canadian ABL Facility provides for revolving loans available to TriCan, RTD and WTD and any other Canadian subsidiaries that the Company designates in the future in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Provided that no default or event of default then exists or would arise therefrom, the Company has the option to request that the ABL Facility be increased by an amount not to exceed $200.0 million (up to $50.0 million of which may be allocated to the Canadian ABL Facility), subject to certain rights of the administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing banks with respect to the lenders providing commitments for such increase. The maturity date for the ABL Facility is November 16, 2017, provided that if on March 1, 2017, either (i) more than $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of ATDIs Senior Secured Notes remains outstanding or (ii) any principal amount of ATDIs Senior Secured Notes remains outstanding with a scheduled maturity date which is earlier than 91 days after November 16, 2017 and excess availability under the ABL Facility is less than 12.5% of the aggregate revolving commitments, then the maturity date will be March 1, 2017. The maturity date for the FILO Facility is October 30, 2014. See Note 18 for additional information regarding the amendment to the FILO Facility and the new maturity date. At December 28, 2013, the Company had $417.1 million outstanding under the U.S. ABL Facility. In addition, the Company had certain letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate amount of $8.1 million, leaving $236.1 million available for additional borrowings under the U.S. ABL Facility. The outstanding balance of the Canadian ABL Facility at December 28, 2013 was $36.4 million, leaving $41.2 million available for additional borrowings. As of December 28, 2013, the outstanding balance of the FILO Facility was $51.9 million and was classified as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as the FILO Facility was refinanced on a long-term basis on January 31, 2014. See Note 18 for additional information. Borrowings under the U.S. ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, either (a) an Adjusted LIBOR rate determined by reference to LIBOR, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, plus an applicable margin of 2.0% as of December 28, 2013 or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime commercial lending rate published by the Bank of America, N.A. as its prime rate for commercial loans, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1 ⁄ 2 of 1% and (3) the one month-Adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.0% per annum, plus an applicable margin of 1.0% as of December 28, 2013. The applicable margins under the U.S. ABL Facility are subject to step ups and step downs based on average excess borrowing availability under the ABL Facility. Borrowings under the Canadian ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either (a) a Canadian base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the base rate as published by Bank of America, N.A. (acting through its Canada branch) as its base rate, (2) the federal funds rate effective plus 1 ⁄ 2 of 1% per annum and (3) the one month-LIBOR rate plus 1.0% per annum, plus an applicable margin of 1.0% as of December 28, 2013 or (b) a Canadian prime rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate as published by Bank of America, N.A. (acting through its Canada branch) as its prime rate, (2) the sum of 1 ⁄ 2 of 1% plus the Canadian overnight rate and (3) the sum of 1% plus the rate of interest per annum equal to the average rate applicable to Canadian Dollar bankers acceptances as published by Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service for a 30 day interest period, plus an applicable margin of 1.0% as of December 28, 2013. The applicable margins under the Canadian ABL Facility are subject to step ups and step downs based on average excess borrowing availability under the ABL Facility. Borrowings under the FILO Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, either (a) an Adjusted LIBOR rate determined by reference to LIBOR, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, plus an applicable margin of 3.5% as of December 28, 2013 or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime commercial lending rate published by the Bank of America, N.A. as its F-26 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS prime rate for commercial loans, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1 ⁄ 2 of 1% and (3) the one month-Adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.0% per annum, plus an applicable margin of 2.5% as of December 28, 2013. The applicable margins under the FILO Facility are subject to step ups and step downs based on average excess borrowing availability under the ABL Facility. The U.S. and Canadian borrowing base at any time equals the sum (subject to certain reserves and other adjustments) of:  85% of eligible accounts receivable of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable; plus  The lesser of (a) 70% of the lesser of cost or fair market value of eligible tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable, and (b) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable; plus  The lesser of (a) 50% of the lower of cost or market value of eligible non-tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable, and (b) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible non-tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, applicable. The FILO borrowing base at any time equals the sum (subject to certain reserves and other adjustments) of:  5% of eligible accounts receivable of the U.S. loan parties, as applicable; plus  7.5% of the net orderly liquidation value of the eligible tire and non-tire inventory of the U.S. loan parties, as applicable. All obligations under the U.S. ABL Facility and the FILO Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and substantially all of ATDIs existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned domestic material restricted subsidiaries, other than Tire Pros Francorp and TDI. The Canadian ABL Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by the U.S. loan parties, TriCan, RTD, WTD and any future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned, material restricted Canadian subsidiaries. Obligations under the U.S. ABL Facility and the FILO Facility are secured by a first-priority lien on inventory, accounts receivable and related assets and a second-priority lien on substantially all other assets of the U.S. loan parties, subject to certain exceptions. Obligations under the Canadian ABL Facility are secured by a first-priority lien on inventory, accounts receivable and related assets and a second-priority lien on substantially all other assets of the U.S. loan parties and the Canadian loan parties, subject to certain exceptions. The ABL Facility and the FILO Facility contain customary covenants, including covenants that restricts the Companys ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, enter into guarantees, enter into certain mergers, make certain loans and investments, dispose of assets, prepay certain debt, declare dividends, modify certain material agreements, enter into transactions with affiliates or change the Companys fiscal year. If the amount available for additional borrowings under the ABL Facility is less than the greater of (a) 10.0% of the lesser of (x) the aggregate commitments under the ABL Facility and (y) the aggregate borrowing base and (b) $25.0 million, then the Company would be subject to an additional covenant requiring them to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. As of December 28, 2013, the Companys additional borrowing availability under the ABL Facility was above the required amount and the Company was therefore not subject to the additional covenants. F-27 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Senior Secured Notes On May 28, 2010, ATDI issued Senior Secured Notes (Senior Secured Notes) due June 1, 2017 in an aggregate principal amount at maturity of $250.0 million. The Senior Secured Notes were issued at a discount from their principal amount at maturity and generated net proceeds of approximately $240.7 million after debt issuance costs (which represents a non-cash financing activity of $9.3 million). The Senior Secured Notes will accrete based on an effective interest rate of 10% to an aggregate accreted value of $250.0 million, the full principal amount at maturity. The Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 9.75% per annum. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2010. The Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed at any time at the option of ATDI, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price of 107.313% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2013 and May 31, 2014, 104.875% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2014 and May 31, 2015, 102.438% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2015 and May 31, 2016 and 100.0% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2016 and May 31, 2017. The Senior Secured Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and substantially all of ATDIs existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned domestic material restricted subsidiaries, other than Tire Pros Francorp and TDI, subject to certain exceptions. The Senior Secured Notes are also collateralized by a second-priority lien on accounts receivable and related assets and a first-priority lien on substantially all other assets (other than inventory), in each case of Holdings, ATDI and the guarantor subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limits ATDIs ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock; pay certain dividends or make certain distributions in respect of ATDIs or repurchase or redeem ATDIs capital stock; make certain loans, investments or other restricted payments; place restrictions on the ability of ATDIs subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to ATDI; engage in transactions with stockholders or affiliates; transfer or sell certain assets; guarantee indebtedness or incur other contingent obligations; incur certain liens; consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of ATDIs assets; enter into certain transactions with ATDIs affiliates; and designate ATDIs subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. Senior Subordinated Notes See Note 18 regarding a recent amendment to the Senior Subordinated Indenture and the issuance of additional Senior Subordinated Notes. On May 28, 2010, ATDI issued Senior Subordinated Notes due June 1, 2018 (Senior Subordinated Notes) in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million. The Senior Subordinated Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 11.50% per annum. Interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2010. The Senior Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at any time at the option of ATDI, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price of 104.0% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2013 and May 31, 2014, 102.0% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2014 and May 31, 2015 and 100.0% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2015 and May 31, 2016. The Senior Subordinated Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and substantially all of ATDIs existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned domestic material restricted subsidiaries, other than Tire Pros Francorp and TDI, subject to certain exceptions. F-28 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The indenture governing the Senior Subordinated Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limits ATDIs ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock; pay certain dividends or make certain distributions in respect of ATDIs or repurchase or redeem ATDIs capital stock; make certain loans, investments or other restricted payments; place restrictions on the ability of ATDIs subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to ATDI; engage in transactions with stockholders or affiliates; transfer or sell certain assets; guarantee indebtedness or incur other contingent obligations; incur certain liens without securing the Senior Subordinated Notes; consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of ATDIs assets; enter into certain transactions with ATDIs affiliates; and designate ATDIs subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. Capital Lease Obligations At December 31, 2011, the Company had a capital lease obligation of $14.1 million, which related to the 2002 sale and subsequent leaseback of three of its owned facilities. Due to continuing involvement with the properties, the Company accounted for the transaction as a direct financing lease and recorded the cash received as a financing obligation. The transaction had an initial lease term of 20 years, followed by two 10 year renewal options. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the initial sales transaction. On February 1, 2012, the Company reacquired one of the three facilities included in the 2002 sale-leaseback transaction for $1.5 million. Accordingly, the original lease was amended to extend the lease term on the two remaining facilities by 5 years as well as to adjust the future lease payments over the remaining 15 years. Per current accounting guidance, the change in the debt terms was not considered substantial. As a result, the Company treated the amendment as a debt modification for accounting purposes and therefore, reduced the financing obligation by the purchase price. Cash payments to the lessor are allocated between interest expense and amortization of the financing obligation. At the end of the lease term, the Company will recognize the sale of the remaining facilities; however, no gain or loss will be recognized as the financing obligation will equal the expected carrying value of the facilities. At December 28, 2013, the outstanding balance of the financing obligation was $12.2 million. 10. Derivative Instruments: In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the risk associated with exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its variable rate debt. These fluctuations can increase the cost of financing, investing and operating the business. The Company has used derivative financial instruments to help manage this risk and reduce the impacts of these exposures and not for trading or other speculative purposes. All derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value as either assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, and are recognized in net income (loss) in the statement of comprehensive income (loss) at the time earnings are affected by the hedged transaction. For other derivatives, changes in the fair value of the contract are recognized immediately in net income (loss) in the statement of comprehensive income (loss). On September 4, 2013, the Company entered into a spot interest rate swap and two forward-starting interest rate swaps (collectively the 3Q 2013 Swaps) each of which are used to hedge a portion of the Companys exposure to changes in its variable interest rate debt. The spot interest rate swap in place covers a notional amount of $100.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 1.145% and expires in September 2016. The forward-starting interest rate swaps in place cover an aggregate notional amount of $100.0 million, of which $50.0 million becomes effective in September 2014 at a fixed interest rate of 1.464% and will expire in September 2016 and F-29 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS $50.0 million becomes effective in September 2015 at a fixed interest rate of 1.942% and will expire in September 2016. The counterparty to each swap is a major financial institution. The 3Q 2013 Swaps do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, changes in the fair value of each contract is recognized in net income (loss) in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). On August 1, 2012, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements (3Q 2012 Swaps) used to hedge a portion of the Companys exposure to changes in its variable interest rate debt. The swaps in place cover an aggregate notional amount of $100.00 million, with each $50.0 million contract having a fixed rate of 0.655% and expiring in June 2016. The counterparty to each swap is a major financial institution. The 3Q 2012 Swaps do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, changes in the fair value of each contract is recognized in net income (loss) in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). On September 23, 2011, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements (3Q 2011 Swaps) used to hedge a portion of the Companys exposure to changes in its variable interest rate debt. The swaps in place cover an aggregate notional amount of $100.0 million, of which $50.0 million is at a fixed rate of 0.74% and will expire in September 2014 and $50.0 million is at a fixed rate of 1.0% and will expire in September 2015. The counterpart to each swap is a major financial institution. The 3Q 2011 Swaps do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, changes in the fair value of each contract is recognized in net income (loss) in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). On February 24, 2011, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements (1Q 2011 Swaps) used to hedge a portion of the Companys exposure to changes in its variable interest rate debt. The swaps in place covered an aggregate notional amount of $75.0 million, of which $25.0 million was at a fixed interest rate of 0.585% and expired in February 2012. The remaining swap covered an aggregate notional amount of $50.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 1.105% and expired in February 2013. The counterparty to each swap was a major financial institution. Neither swap met the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, changes in the fair value of each contract were recognized in net income (loss) in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). The following table presents the fair values of the Companys derivative instruments included within the consolidated balance sheets as of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012: Liability Derivatives In thousands Balance Sheet Location December 28, 2013 December 29, 2012 Derivatives not designated as hedges: 1Q 2011 swap$50 million notional Accrued expenses $  $ 149 3Q 2011 swaps$100 million notional Accrued expenses 792 1,314 3Q 2012 swaps$100 million notional Accrued expenses 280 750 3Q 2013 swaps$200 million notional Accrued expenses 1,880  Total $ 2,952 $ 2,213 F-30 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The pre-tax effect of the Companys derivative instruments on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) was as follows: (Gain) Loss Recognized In thousands Location of (Gain) Loss Recognized Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2013 Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2012 Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2011 Derivatives not designated as hedges: 1Q 2011 swap$50 million notional Interest Expense $ (149 ) $ (154 ) $ 303 1Q 2011 swap$25 million notional Interest Expense  (12 ) 12 3Q 2011 swaps$100 million notional Interest Expense (522 ) 764 551 3Q 2012 swaps$100 million notional Interest Expense (470 ) 750  3Q 2013 swaps$200 million notional Interest Expense 1,880   Total $ 739 $ 1,348 $ 866 11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The accounting standard for fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value that is based on the inputs market participants use to determine the fair value of an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy to prioritize those inputs. The fair value hierarchy is comprised of three levels that are described below:  Level 1 Inputs based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  Level 3 Unobservable inputs based on little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances. A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table presents the fair value and hierarchy levels for the Companys assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 28, 2013: Fair Value Measurements In thousands Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Benefit trust assets $ 3,412 $ 3,412 $  $  Total $ 3,412 $ 3,412 $  $  Liabilities: Derivative instruments $ 2,952 $  $ 2,952 $  Total $ 2,952 $  $ 2,952 $  F-31 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company determines fair value of its financial assets and liabilities using the following methodologies:  Benefit trust assets These assets include money market and mutual funds that are the underlying for deferred compensation plan assets, held in a rabbi trust. The fair value of the assets is based on observable market prices quoted in readily accessible and observable markets.  Derivative instruments These instruments consist of interest rate swaps. The fair value is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments from a financial institution that is counterparty to the transaction. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The methodologies used by the Company to determine the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities on a recurring basis at December 28, 2013 are the same as those used at December 29, 2012. As a result, there have been no transfers between Level 1and Level 2 categories. 12. Employee Benefits: The Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation , which requires a fair-value based method for measuring the value of stock-based compensation. Fair value is measured once at the date of grant and is not adjusted for subsequent changes. The Companys stock-based compensation plans include programs for stock options and restricted stock units. Stock Options In August 2010, the Company adopted a Management Equity Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan), pursuant to which the Company will grant options to selected employees and directors of the Company. The 2010 Plan, which includes both time-based and performance-based awards, was amended on February 15, 2013 by the board of directors of the Company to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock for which stock options may be granted under the 2010 Plan, from 48.6 million to 52.1 million. In addition to the increase in the maximum number of shares, on February 15, 2013 the board of directors of the Company approved the issuance of stock options to certain members of management. The approved options are for the purchase of up to 3.5 million shares of common stock, have an exercise price of $1.20 per share, and vest over a three to five-year vesting period. As of December 28, 2013, the Company has 2.5 million shares available for future incentive awards. See Note 18 regarding a recent amendment to the 2010 Plan and the issuance of stock options subsequent to the year ended December 28, 2013. F-32 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Changes in options outstanding under the 2010 Plan are as follows: Options Outstanding Weighted Average Exercise Price Options Exercisable Weighted Average Exercise Price January 1, 2011 44,448,000 1.00   Granted 1,900,000 1.00 n/a n/a Cancelled (1,749,600 ) 1.00 n/a n/a December 31, 2011 44,598,400 $ 1.00 8,710,401 $ 1.00 Granted 2,277,600 1.14 n/a n/a Exercised (38,000 ) 1.00 n/a n/a Cancelled (156,400 ) 1.00 n/a n/a December 29, 2012 46,681,600 $ 1.01 17,594,936 $ 1.00 Granted 3,500,002 1.20 n/a n/a Exercised   n/a n/a Cancelled (665,099 ) 1.01 n/a n/a December 28, 2013 49,516,503 $ 1.02 27,794,844 $ 1.01 Options granted under the 2010 Plan expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant and vest based on the passage of time and/or the achievement of certain performance targets in equal installments over three or five years. The weighted-average remaining contractual term for options outstanding and exercisable at December 28, 2013 was 6.9 years and 6.8 years, respectively. The fair value of each of the Companys time-based stock option awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the three or five-year vesting period of the options. However, for options granted with performance target requirements, compensation expense is recognized when it is probable that both the performance target will be achieved and the requisite service period is satisfied. At December 28, 2013 unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested options granted under the 2010 Plan totaled $7.6 million and the weighted-average period over which this expense will be recognized is 1.3 years. The weighted average fair value of the stock options granted during the fiscal years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was $0.54, $0.50 and $0.44, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used: Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2013 December 29, 2012 December 31, 2011 Risk-free interest rate 1.38 % 1.48 % 2.41 % Dividend yield    Expected life 6.0 years 6.5 years 6.4 years Volatility 45.39 % 42.81 % 40.75 % As the Company does not have sufficient historical volatility data for the Companys own common stock, the stock price volatility utilized in the fair value calculation is based on the Companys peer group in the industry in which it does business. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award. Because the Company does not have relevant data available regarding the expected life of the award, the expected life of the award is derived from the Simplified Method as allowed under SAB Topic 14. F-33 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) In October 2010, the Company adopted the Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Plan (the 2010 RSU Plan), pursuant to which the Company will grant restricted stock units to non-employee directors of the Company. Upon vesting, these awards entitle the holder to receive one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit granted. The 2010 RSU Plan provides that a maximum of 0.8 million shares of common stock of the Company may be granted to non-employee directors of the Company, of which 0.3 million remain available at December 28, 2013 for future incentive awards. See Note 18 regarding the issuance of RSUs subsequent to the year ended December 28, 2013. The following table summarizes RSU activity under the 2010 RSU Plan: Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding and unvested at January 1, 2011 150,000 $ 1.00 Granted 100,000 1.00 Vested (75,000 ) 1.00 Cancelled   Outstanding and unvested at December 31, 2011 175,000 $ 1.00 Granted 219,298 1.14 Vested (125,000 ) 1.00 Cancelled   Outstanding and unvested at December 29, 2012 269,298 $ 1.11 Granted   Vested (159,649 ) 1.10 Cancelled (21,930 ) 1.14 Outstanding and unvested at December 28, 2013 87,719 $ 1.14 The fair value of each of the RSU awards is measured as the grant-date price of the common stock and is expensed on a straight- line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the two year vesting period. At December 28, 2013, the Company has recognized all compensation expense related to non-vested RSUs granted under the 2010 RSU Plan as all outstanding and unvested RSUs at December 28, 2013 will vest at the beginning of fiscal 2014. Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation expense is included in selling general and administrative expenses within the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). The amount of compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the granted awards that are expected to vest. Ultimately, the total expense recognized over the vesting period will equal the fair value of the awards as of the grant date that actually vest. The following table summarizes the compensation expense recognized: Fiscal Year Ended In thousands December 28, 2013 December 29, 2012 December 31, 2011 Stock Options $ 2,524 $ 4,118 $ 3,999 Restricted Stock Units 110 231 115 Total $ 2,634 $ 4,349 $ 4,114 F-34 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Deferred Compensation Plan The Company has a deferred compensation plan for its top executives and divisional employees covered by the executive bonus plan to encourage each participant to promote the long-term interests of the Company. Each participant is allowed to defer portions of their annual salary as well as bonuses received into the plan. In addition to employee deferrals, the Company makes contributions on behalf of its top executives and certain of the divisional employees in varying amounts. The plan provides that an employee who becomes a participant on or before November 23, 1998, shall be fully vested in all amounts credited to such participants account. An employee who becomes a participant after November 23, 1998 shall be at all times fully vested in elective deferrals into such participants account and, as to contributions made by the Company, shall vest at a rate of twenty percent (20%) per year as long as such participant is an employee on January 1 of each year. The deferred compensation plan may be altered and amended by the Companys Board of Directors. At December 28, 2013, the Companys obligation related to its deferred compensation plan was $3.4 million, recorded in the consolidated balance sheet within other non-current liabilities. At December 29, 2012, the Companys obligation related to its deferred compensation plan was $2.7 million. The Company provides for funding of the obligation through a Rabbi Trust, which holds various investments, including mutual funds and money market funds. Amounts related to the Rabbi Trust were $3.4 million and $2.7 million at December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, respectively, and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets within other non-current assets. Contributions made by the Company on behalf of its employees were less than $0.1 million during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011. 401(k) Plans The Company maintains a qualified profit sharing and 401(k) plan for eligible employees. All accounts are funded based on employee contributions to the plan, with the limits of such contributions determined by the Board of Directors. Effective January 1, 2002, the benefit formula for all participants was determined to be a match of 50% of participant contributions, up to 6% of their compensation. The plan also provides for contributions in such amounts as the Board of Directors may annually determine for the profit sharing portion of the plan. Employees vest in the 401(k) match and profit sharing contribution over a 5-year period. The Company match of participant contributions is recorded within selling, general and administrative expense. For the fiscal years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Company contributed $2.8 million, $2.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively. 13. Commitments and Contingencies: Leases The Company leases land, buildings, equipment and vehicles under various noncancellable operating leases, which expire between 2014 and 2027. Future minimum lease commitments, net of sublease income, at December 28, 2013 are as follows: In thousands 2014 $ 88,941 2015 79,087 2016 68,646 2017 60,772 2018 51,786 Thereafter 175,115 Total $ 524,347 F-35 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Companys rent expense, net of sublease income, under these operating leases was $92.9 million in fiscal 2013, $75.1 million in fiscal 2012 and $59.1 million in fiscal 2011. On March 27, 2002, the Company completed an agreement for the sale and leaseback of three of its owned facilities. On February 1, 2012, the Company reacquired one of the three facilities included in the 2002 sale-leaseback transaction. Accordingly, the original lease was amended to extend the lease term on the two remaining facilities by 5 years as well as to adjust the future lease payments over the remaining 15 years. The Company reports this transaction as a capital lease using direct financing lease accounting. As such, the Company has a capital lease obligation of $12.2 million at December 28, 2013. See Note 9 for more information on this capital lease. Obligations under the Companys other capital leases are not material. The Company remains liable as a guarantor on certain leases related to Winston Tire Company. As of December 28, 2013, the Companys total obligations, as guarantor on these leases, are approximately $2.0 million extending over five years. However, the Company has secured assignments or sublease agreements for the vast majority of these commitments with contractually assigned or subleased rentals of approximately $1.8 million. A provision has been made for the net present value of the estimated shortfall. Legal and Tax Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in various lawsuits, including class action lawsuits as well as various audits and reviews regarding its federal, state and local tax filings, arising out of the ordinary conduct of its business. Management does not expect that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys business or financial condition. As to tax filings, the Company believes that the various tax filings have been made in a timely fashion and in accordance with applicable federal, state, foregin and local tax code requirements. Additionally, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of any tax disputes, but will adjust its reserves if events so dictate in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance. To the extent that the ultimate results differ from the original or adjusted estimates of the Company, the effect will be recorded in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes. See Note 14 for further description of the accounting standards for income taxes and the related impacts. 14. Income Taxes: The Companys income tax provision (benefit) consisted of the following components: Fiscal Year Ended In thousands December 28, 2013 December 29, 2012 December 31, 2011 Federal: Current provision (benefit) $ 13,721 $ 4,986 $ 6,937 Deferred provision (benefit) (17,989 ) (9,675 ) (5,679 ) Total (4,268 ) (4,689 ) 1,258 State: Current provision (benefit) 3,700 1,876 3,263 Deferred provision (benefit) (3,604 ) (2,009 ) (57 ) Total 96 (133 ) 3,206 Foreign: Current provision (benefit) 1,963 49  Deferred provision (benefit) (1,773 ) (1,192 )  Total 190 (1,143 )  Total provision (benefit) $ (3,982 ) $ (5,965 ) $ 4,464 F-36 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The provision (benefit) for income taxes differs from the amount of income taxes computed by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to pretax income (loss), as a result of the following differences: Fiscal Year Ended In thousands December 28, 2013 December 29, 2012 December 31, 2011 Income tax provision (benefit) computed at the federal statutory rate $ (3,666 ) $ (7,057 ) $ 1,516 State income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 698 (86 ) 607 Benefit of lower foreign rate (84 ) 395  Increase in state effective tax rate   2,167 Permanent differences 647 437 505 Debt issuance costs (244 ) (221 ) (200 ) Non-deductible transaction costs 566 430  Tax settlements and other adjustments to uncertain tax positions (1,542 ) (2 ) (376 ) Increase (decrease) in valuation allowance (281 ) 132 245 Other (76 ) 7  Income tax provision (benefit) $ (3,982 ) $ (5,965 ) $ 4,464 Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes and (b) operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. As of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, amounts related to deferred income taxes have been classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as follows: In thousands December 28, 2013 December 29, 2012 Deferred tax assets (liabilities): Current $ 15,719 $ 16,458 Noncurrent (268,432 ) (283,009 ) Total $ (252,713 ) $ (266,551 ) F-37 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The tax effects of the significant temporary differences that comprise deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 for the Company are as follows: In thousands December 28, 2013 December 29, 2012 Deferred tax assets: Accrued expenses and liabilities $ 8,686 $ 8,491 Net operating loss carry-forwards 1,232 2,062 Employee benefits 9,622 7,594 Inventory cost capitalization 6,359 7,633 Other assets (925 ) 954 Other 5,215 5,534 Gross deferred tax assets 30,189 32,268 Less: Deferred tax valuation allowances (750 ) (762 ) Net deferred tax assets 29,439 31,506 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation and amortization of intangibles (280,888 ) (296,929 ) Other (1,264 ) (1,128 ) Gross deferred tax liabilities (282,152 ) (298,057 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ (252,713 ) $ (266,551 ) As part of the acquisition of the Company by TPG, the Company generated substantial tax deductions relating to the exercise of stock options and payments made for transaction expenses. At December 28, 2013, the balance of this acquired non-current deferred tax asset is $5.9 million, which represents the anticipated tax benefits that the Company expects to achieve in future years from such deductions. The remaining net deferred tax liability primarily relates to the expected future tax liability associated with the non-deductible, identified, intangible assets that were recorded during the Merger less existing tax deductible intangibles, assuming an effective tax rate of 39.6%. It is the Companys intention to indefinitely reinvest all undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. As these earnings are considered permanently reinvested, no provisions for U.S. federal or state income taxes are required under ASC 740-30. Determination of the amount of unrecognized U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities on these unremitted earnings is not practicable. Management regularly reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets, and where appropriate, establishes a valuation allowance against them. The Company concluded that certain deferred tax assets related to certain capital losses do not meet the requirement of being more likely than not that they will be realized. As a result, the Company established a valuation allowance against them. At December 28, 2013, the Company had $1.6 million of NOLs available for federal tax purposes as well as $14.2 million available for state tax purposes. The NOLs are available to offset taxable income in future years and expire between 2014 and 2029. The Company expects to utilize these NOLs prior to their expiration date. At December 28, 2013, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $0.7 million, of which $0.4 million is included within accrued expenses and $0.3 million is included within other liabilities within the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate is $0.2 million as of December 28, 2013. In addition, $0.5 million related to temporary timing differences. F-38 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: In thousands December 28, 2013 December 29, 2012 December 31, 2011 Beginning balance $ 1,953 $ 1,815 $ 2,181 (Reductions) additions based on tax positions related to the current year, net (688 ) 138 (366 ) Settlements    Reductions for lapse in statute of limitations (559 )   Ending balance $ 706 $ 1,953 $ 1,815 During the next 12 months, management does not believe it is reasonably possible that there will be a significant change in the Companys uncertain tax benefits. While the Company believes that it has adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than the Companys accrued position. Accordingly, additional provisions of federal and state-related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. The Company files federal income tax returns, as well as multiple state jurisdiction tax returns. The tax years 20102012 remain open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The tax years 20102012 remain open to examination by other major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject (primarily Canada and other state and local jurisdictions). In September 2013, the Internal Revenue Service released final Tangible Property Regulations (the Final Regulations). The Final Regulations provide guidance on applying Section 263(a) of the Code to amounts paid to acquire, produce or improve tangible property, as well as rules for materials and supplies (Code Section 162). These regulations contain certain changes from the temporary and proposed tangible property regulations that were issued on December 27, 2011. The Final Regulations are generally effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. In addition, taxpayers are permitted to early adopt the Final Regulations for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2012. The Company does not expect the Final Regulations to have a material effect on its results of operations. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its financial condition. 15. Stockholders Equity See Note 18 regarding recent equity contribution received from TPG and certain co-investors. In connection with the Merger on May 28, 2010, TPG and certain co-investors contributed $675.4 million through the purchase of the Companys common stock. Subsequent to May 28, 2010, certain members of the Companys management and certain board members purchased common stock in the Company. At December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, these amounts totaled $8.7 million. Accordingly, the Company recorded the basis in these shares in additional paid-in capital. On November 30, 2012, TPG and certain co-investors contributed $60.0 million through the purchase of 50.0 million shares of the Companys common stock. The proceeds from this equity contribution were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of TriCan. Accordingly, the Company recorded the basis in these shares in additional paid-in capital. See Note 3 for additional information on the TriCan acquisition. F-39 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Common Stock The Company is authorized to issue up to 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share. At December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, 734,168,402 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The Company maintains a deferred compensation plan for certain eligible employees, in which the obligation is funded through a Rabbi Trust. Unrealized gains and losses on Rabbi Trust assets are recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amounted to a gain of $0.2 and $0.1 million at December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, respectively. In addition, gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amounted to a loss of $9.1 million and $0.3 million at December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, respectively. 16. Related Party Transaction: Upon the closing of the Merger, the Company entered into a transaction and monitoring fee letter agreement with TPG pursuant to which the Company retained TPG to provide certain management, consulting, and financial services to the Company, when and as requested by the Company. The Company agreed to pay TPG a monitoring fee equal to 2.0% of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other adjustments (Adjusted EBITDA). The monitoring fee is payable in quarterly installments in arrears at the end of each fiscal quarter. In the event of an initial public offering, sale of all or substantially all of the Companys assets or a change of control transaction, TPG is entitled to receive, on its request and in lieu of any continuing payment of the monitoring fee, an aggregate termination fee of $12.5 million. For the fiscal years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Company recorded $5.8 million, $7.4 million and $4.6 million, respectively in expense related to the monitoring fee for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 which is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 17.

Subsequent Event: We have evaluated subsequent events for recognition through March 7, 2014, the original issuance date of our subsidiary American Tire Distributors Holdings, Inc.s financial statements. Subsequent events have been evaluated for disclosure through June 16, 2014, the date of reissuance. Kipling Acquisition On January 17, 2014, TriCan entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Kipling Tire Co. LTD., a corporation governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario (Kipling), pursuant to which TriCan agreed to acquire the wholesale distribution business of Kipling. Kipling has operated as a retail-wholesale business since 1982. Kiplings wholesale business distributes tires from its Etobicoke facilities to approximately 400 retail customers in Southern Ontario. Kiplings retail operations were not acquired by TriCan and will continue to operate under its current ownership. This acquisition will further strengthen TriCans presence in the Southern Ontario region of Canada. The acquisition was completed on January 17, 2014 and was funded through the Companys Canadian ABL Facility. The Company does not believe the acquisition of Kipling is a material transaction subject to the disclosures and supplemental pro forma information required by ASC 805 Business Combinations . As a result, the information is not presented. Hercules Acquisition On January 31, 2014, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated January 24, 2014 (the Merger Agreement), among ATD Merger Sub II LLC (Merger Sub), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings, ATDI, Hercules Tire Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Hercules Holdings), the equityholders of Hercules Holdings (each a Seller and, collectively the Sellers) and the Sellers Representative, Merger Sub merged with and into Hercules Holdings, with Hercules Holdings being the surviving entity (the Merger). As a result of the Merger, Hercules Holdings became an indirect 100% owned subsidiary of Holdings. Hercules Holdings owns all of the capital stock of The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company, a Connecticut corporation (Hercules). Hercules Holdings has no material assets or operations other than its ownership of Hercules. Hercules is engaged in the business of purchasing, marketing, distributing and selling replacement tires for passenger cars, trucks, and certain off road vehicles to tire dealers, wholesale distributors, retail distributors and others in the United States, Canada and internationally. Hercules operated 15 distribution centers in the United States, 6 distribution centers in Canada and one warehouse in northern China. Hercules also markets the Hercules brand, which is one of the most sought-after proprietary tire brands in the industry. The acquisition of Hercules will strengthen the Companys presence in major markets such as California, Texas and Florida in addition to increasing its presence in Canada. Additionally, Hercules strong logistics and sourcing capabilities, including a long-standing presence in China, will also allow the Company to capitalize on the growing import market, as well as, providing the ability to expand the international sales of the Hercules brand. Finally, this acquisition, will allow the Company to be a brand marketer of the Hercules brand which today has a 2% market share of the passenger and light truck market in North America and a 3% share of highway truck tires in North America. The acquisition closed for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $319.3 million (the Hercules Closing Purchase Price), consisting of net cash consideration of $310.4 million, contingent consideration of $3.5 million and non-cash consideration for debt assumed of $5.4 million. The Hercules Closing Purchase Price includes an estimate for initial working capital adjustments. The Merger Agreement provides for the payment of up to $6.5 million in additional consideration contingent upon the occurrence of certain post-closing events (to the extent payable, the Hercules Additional Purchase Price and, collectively with the Hercules Closing Purchase Price, the Hercules Purchase Price). The cash consideration paid for the Merger was funded by a F-42 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS combination of the issuance of additional Senior Subordinated Notes, as more fully described below, an equity contribution of $50.0 million from Holdings indirect parent, and borrowings under the Companys credit agreement. The Hercules Closing Purchase Price is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including, but not limited to, working capital adjustments. The Merger was recorded during the quarter ended April 5, 2014 using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with current accounting guidance for business combinations and non-controlling interest. As a result, the Hercules Closing Purchase Price has been preliminarily allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair market value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. The preliminary allocation of the Hercules Closing Purchase Price is as follows: In thousands Cash $ 12,187 Accounts receivable 61,610 Inventory 156,652 Other current assets 5,064 Property and equipment 29,970 Intangible assets 155,704 Total assets acquired 421,187 Accounts payable 95,616 Accrued and other liabilities 6,154 Deferred income taxes 69,872 Other liabilities 2,325 Total liabilities assumed 173,967 Net assets acquired 247,220 Goodwill 72,082 Purchase price $ 319,302 The excess of the purchase price over the amounts allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities is included in goodwill for the Companys quarter ended April 5, 2014, and amounted to $72.1 million. The premium in the purchase price for the Merger primarily relates to growth opportunities associated with the Hercules brand and the anticipated realization of operational and cost synergies. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable were stated at their historical carrying values, which approximate their fair value, given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Inventory was recorded at fair value, based on computations which considered many factors including the estimated selling price of the inventory, the cost to dispose the inventory as well as the replacement cost of the inventory, where applicable. F-43 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company recorded intangible assets during the quarter ended April 5, 2014 based on their estimated fair value which consisted of the following: In thousands Estimated Useful Life Estimated Fair Value Customer list 18 years $ 147,216 Trade names 15 years 8,488 Total $ 155,704 Terrys Tire Acquisition On March 28, 2014, ATDI completed its acquisition of Terrys Tire Town Holdings, Inc., an Ohio corporation (Terrys Tire and such acquisition, the Terrys Tire Acquisition). The Terrys Tire Acquisition was completed pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement) entered into on February 17, 2014 between ATDI and TTT Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Terrys Tire and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of purchasing, marketing, distributing and selling tires, wheels and related tire and wheel accessories on a wholesale basis to tire dealers, wholesale distributors, retail chains, automotive dealers and others, retreading tires and selling retread and other commercial tires through commercial outlets to end users and selling tires directly to consumers via the internet. Terrys Tire operated 10 distribution centers spanning from Virginia to Maine and in Ohio. The acquisition of Terrys Tire will enhance the Companys market position in these areas and aligns very well with their distribution centers, especially the new distribution centers opened by the Company over the past two years in the Northeast and Ohio. The Terrys Tire acquisition closed for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $378.1 million (the Terrys Tire Purchase Price), consisting of cash consideration of approximately $363.4 million, contingent consideration of $12.5 million and non-cash consideration for debt assumed of $2.2 million. The cash consideration paid for the Terrys Tire Acquisition included estimated working capital adjustments and a portion of consideration contingent on certain events achieved prior to closing. The Terrys Tire Purchase Price was funded by a combination of borrowings under a new senior secured term loan facility, as more fully described below, and borrowings of approximately $72.5 million under the Companys existing U.S. ABL Facility. The Terrys Tire Purchase Price is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including but not limited to, working capital adjustments. Of the $363.4 million in cash consideration, $41.4 million is held in escrow pending the resolution of the post-closing adjustments and other escrow release conditions in accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and escrow agreement. F-44 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The acquisition of Terrys Tire was recorded during the quarter ended April 5, 2014 using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with current accounting guidance for business combinations and non-controlling interest. As of the date of these financial statements, the Company is in the process of finalizing intangible asset valuations as well as continuing to evaluate the initial purchase price allocation. Accordingly, management has used its best estimates in the allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated preliminary fair market value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. As additional information is obtained about these assets and liabilities within the measurement period, the Company expects to refine its estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price more accurately. The preliminary allocation of the Terrys Tire Purchase Price is as follows: In thousands Cash $ 7,238 Accounts receivable 42,515 Inventory 101,328 Assets held for sale 3,321 Other current assets 2,203 Deferred income taxes 4,947 Property and equipment 7,072 Intangible asset 201,000 Other assets 541 Total assets acquired 370,165 Accounts payable 78,488 Accrued and other liabilities 3,470 Liabilities held for sale 436 Total liabilities assumed 82,394 Net assets acquired 287,771 Goodwill 90,280 Purchase price $ 378,051 The excess of the purchase price over the amounts allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities is included in goodwill for the Companys quarter ended April 5, 2014, and amounted to $90.3 million. The premium in the purchase price paid for the acquisition of Terrys Tire primarily reflects the anticipated realization of operational and cost synergies. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable were stated at their historical carrying values, which approximate their fair value, given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Inventory was recorded at fair value, based on computations which considered many factors including the estimated selling price of the inventory, the cost to dispose the inventory as well as the replacement cost of the inventory, where applicable. During the quarter ended April 5, 2014, the Company recorded a finite-lived customer list intangible asset based on its estimated fair value of $201.0 million. The estimated useful life of the customer list intangible asset is eighteen years based on the Companys internal estimates to be finalized when the third-party intangible asset valuations are completed. As part of the acquisition of Terrys Tire, the Company acquired Terrys Tires commercial and retread businesses. As the Companys core business does not include commercial and retread operations, the Company decided that it would divest of these businesses. As it is managements intention to divest the commercial and F-45 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS retread businesses during fiscal 2014 and as all held for sale criteria has been met, the related assets and liabilities of the commercial and retread businesses were classified as held for sale at the acquisition date. As part of the preliminary purchase price allocation, the estimated fair value of the assets held for sale was $3.3 million, including $2.5 million in current assets and net property and equipment of $0.8 million. The estimated fair value of the liabilities held for sale was $0.4 million of which the entire amount related to current liabilities. As additional information is obtained about these assets and liabilities within the measurement period, the Company expects to refine its estimate of the fair values related to these assets and liabilities. Amendment of Senior Subordinated Indenture On January 31, 2014, ATDI entered into the Sixth Supplemental Indenture (the Sixth Supplemental Indenture) with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust company, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee) and the guarantors party thereto (the Guarantors) to the Subordinated Notes Indenture, dated as of May 28, 2010, among ATDI, the guarantors party thereto and the Trustee (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the Subordinated Indenture) relating to the $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 11.50% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 of ATDI initially issued on May 28, 2010 (the Initial Subordinated Notes). ATDI received consents from a 100% of the holders of the Initial Subordinated Notes and accepted such consents. The amendments included in the Sixth Supplemental Indenture provide for ATDIs ability to incur additional senior debt under the Subordinated Indenture under certain circumstances. Subordinated Notes Offering In connection with the consummation of the Hercules Merger, on January 31, 2014, ATDI completed the sale to certain purchasers of $225.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 11.50% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the Additional Subordinated Notes). The net proceeds to ATDI from the sale of the Additional Subordinated Notes was approximately $221.1 million. The Additional Subordinated Notes were issued pursuant to the Seventh Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 31, 2014, among ATDI, the Guarantors and the Trustee (the Seventh Supplemental Indenture) to the Senior Subordinated Indenture. The Additional Subordinated Notes have identical terms to the Initial Subordinated Notes, except the Additional Subordinated Notes will accrue interest from January 31, 2014. The Additional Subordinated Notes and the Initial Subordinated Notes will be treated as a single class of securities for all purposes under the Subordinated Indenture. However, the Additional Subordinated Notes will be issued with separate CUSIP numbers from the Initial Subordinated Notes and will not be fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the Initial Subordinated Notes. Interest on the Additional Subordinated Notes will be paid semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2014. The Additional Subordinated Notes will mature on June 1, 2018. The Additional Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at any time at the option of ATDI, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price of 104.0% of the principal amount if the redemption rate occurs between June 1, 2013 and May 31, 2014, 102.0% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2014 and May 31, 2015 and 100.0% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs on June 1, 2015 or thereafter. Credit Agreement Amendment Also in connection with the Hercules Merger, on January 31, 2014, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment). The Second Amendment (1) increases the aggregate principal amount available under the Canadian ABL Facility from F-46 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS $100.0 million to $125.0 million, subject to the Canadian borrowing base, (2) increases the aggregate principal amount available under the U.S. first-in last-out facility (the U.S. FILO Facility) from $60.0 million to $80.0 million, subject to the borrowing base specific thereto as modified by the Second Amendment (3) extends the maturity date for the U.S. FILO Facility to 36 months from January 31, 2014, (4) increases the inventory advance rate under the U.S. FILO Facility borrowing base from 7.5% to 10.0% of net orderly liquidation value, and (5) provides the Canadian Borrowers under the agreement with a new first-in last-out facility (the Canadian FILO Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $15.0 million, subject to a borrowing base specific thereto. The Canadian FILO borrowing base at any time equals the sum (subject to certain reserves and other adjustments) of (i) 5% of eligible accounts receivable of the Canadian loan parties, as applicable; plus (ii) 10.0% of the net orderly liquidation value of the eligible tire and non-tire inventory of the Canadian loan parties, as applicable. The maturity date for the Canadian FILO Facility is the date that is 36 months from January 31, 2014. Hercules, and certain of its subsidiaries, was made a party to, and its equity interests were pledged as collateral under, the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement upon closing of the Merger. The Second Amendment also made certain other changes to the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment did not change the maturity dates of the U.S. ABL Facility or the Canadian ABL Facility or the material terms under which either facility may be accelerated or the U.S. ABL Facility may be increased. Approximately $40.4 million, net of cash received in the Merger, was drawn under the U.S. ABL Facility to finance a portion of the Hercules Closing Purchase Price. Immediately following the closing of the Merger, $5.6 million was drawn on the Canadian FILO Facility with a corresponding decrease to the Canadian ABL Facility. Senior Secured Term Loan In connection with the acquisition of Terrys Tire, on March 28, 2014, ATDI entered into a credit agreement that provided for a senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million (the Term Loan). The Term Loan was issued at a discount of 0.25% which, combined with certain debt issuance costs paid at closing, resulted in net proceeds of approximately $290.9 million. The Term Loan will accrete based on an effective interest rate of 6% to an aggregate accreted value of $300.0 million, the full principal amount at maturity. The net proceeds from the Term Loan were used to finance a portion of the Terrys Tire Purchase Price. The maturity date for the Term Loan is June 1, 2018. Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, initially, either (a) a Eurodollar rate determined by reference to LIBOR, plus an applicable margin of 4.75% or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds rate plus 1 ⁄ 2 of 1%, (2) the prime commercial lending rate published by the Bank of America, N.A. as its prime rate for commercial loans and (3) the one month Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin of 3.75%. The Eurodollar rate is subject to an interest rate floor of 1.0%. The applicable margins under the Term Loan are subject to a step down based on a consolidated net leverage ratio, as defined in the agreement. All obligations under the Term Loan are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and, subject to certain customary exceptions, all of ATDIs existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned domestic material subsidiaries. Obligations under the Term Loan are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all property, assets and capital stock of ATDI except accounts receivable, inventory and related intangible assets and a second-priority lien on all accounts receivable and related intangible assets. The Term Loan contains customary covenants, including covenants that restrict the Companys ability to incur additional debt, create liens, enter into guarantees, enter into certain mergers, make certain loans and investments, dispose of assets, prepay certain debt, declare dividends, modify certain material agreements, enter into transactions with affiliates, change the nature of the Companys business or change the Companys fiscal year. F-47 ATD CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Subject to certain exceptions, the Company is required to repay the Term Loan in certain circumstances, including with 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% and 0%, as applicable, subject to attaining certain senior secured net leverage ratios) of its annual excess cash flow, as defined in the Term Loan agreement. The Term Loan also contains repayments provision related to non-ordinary course asset or property sales when certain conditions are met, and related to the incurrence of debt that is not permitted under the agreement. Amendment of Management Equity Incentive Plan and Issuance of Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units On April 28, 2014, the board of directors of the Company amended the Management Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2010 Plan, to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock of the Company for which stock options may be granted under the 2010 Plan from 52.1 million to 54.4 million. In addition to the increase in the maximum number of shares, on April 28, 2014 the board of directors of the Company approved the issuance of stock options to certain members of management and the issuance of restricted stock units to the non-employee directors of the Company. The approved stock options are for the purchase of up to 4.5 million shares of common stock, have an exercise price of $1.50 per share and vest over a two-year vesting period. The approved restricted stock units are for the issuance of up to 0.1 million shares of common stock, have a grant date fair value of $1.50 per share and vest over a two-year vesting period. On June 16, 2014, the Company amended its credit agreement relating to its senior secured term loan facility to borrow an additional $340 million on the same terms as our existing Term Loan. Pursuant to the amendment, until August 15, 2014, the Company also has the right to borrow up to an additional $80 million on the same terms as its existing Term Loan. The proceeds from these additional borrowings were or will be used to redeem all amounts outstanding under the Companys Senior Secured Notes and pay related fees and expenses, as well as for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes, including the financing of potential future acquisitions.

F-54 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 1. Nature of Business: ATD Corporation (also referred to herein as ATD Corp and formerly Accelerate Parent Corp.) is a Delaware corporation that indirectly owns 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of American Tire Distributors Holdings, Inc. (Holdings), a Delaware corporation. Holdings owns 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of American Tire Distributors, Inc. (ATDI), a Delaware corporation. ATD Corp has no significant assets or operations other than its ownership of ATDI. The operations of ATDI and its subsidiaries constitute the operations of ATD Corp presented under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. ATDI is primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of tires, custom wheels and accessories, and related tire supplies and tools. Its customer base is comprised primarily of independent tire dealers with the remainder of other customers representing various national and corporate accounts. ATDI serves a majority of the contiguous United States, as well as Canada, through one operating and reportable segment. Unless the context otherwise requires, Company herein refers to ATD Corp and its consolidated subsidiaries. In June 2014, the Company changed its name from Accelerate Parent Corp. to ATD Corporation. On May 28, 2010, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 20, 2010, the Company was acquired by TPG Capital, L.P. (TPG or the Sponsor) and certain co-investors (the Merger). 2. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidated operations of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) within the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC). In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the consolidated unaudited results for the interim periods presented. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2013. The Companys fiscal year is based on either a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to each December 31. Therefore, the financial results of 53-week fiscal years, and the associated 14-week quarter, will not be comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated quarters having only 13 weeks. The quarter ended April 5, 2014 contains operating results for 14 weeks while the quarter ended March 30, 2013 contains operating results for 13 weeks. It should be noted that the Company and its recently acquired subsidiaries, The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company (Hercules) and Terrys Tire Town Holdings, Inc. (Terrys Tire), have different quarter-end reporting dates. Both Hercules and Terrys Tire have March 31 quarter-end reporting dates. There were no significant changes to the business subsequent to their fiscal period ends that would have a material impact on the condensed consolidated balance sheet or condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) as of and for the quarter ended April 5, 2014. 3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. ASU 2013-11 clarifies guidance and eliminates diversity in practice on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists at the reporting date. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2013 and subsequent interim periods. The Company adopted this guidance on December 29, 2013 (the first day of its 2014 fiscal year) and its adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. F-55 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, (ASU 2014-08). Under ASU 2014-08, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations that have a major effect on the companys operations and financial results should be presented as discontinued operations. Additionally, ASU 2014-08 requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. The amendments in ASU 2014-08 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014. However, ASU 2014-08 should not be applied to a component that is classified as held for sale before the effective date even if the component is disposed of after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in financial statement previously issued. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. The standards core principle is that a company should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under todays guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2018 and, at that time the Company may adopt the new standard under the full retrospective method or the modified retrospective method. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the method and impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Companys consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 4. Acquisitions: 2014 Acquisitions On March 28, 2014, ATDI completed its acquisition of Terrys Tire Town Holdings, Inc., an Ohio corporation (Terrys Tire and such acquisition, the Terrys Tire Acquisition). The Terrys Tire Acquisition was completed pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement) entered into on February 17, 2014 between ATDI and TTT Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Terrys Tire and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of purchasing, marketing, distributing and selling tires, wheels and related tire and wheel accessories on a wholesale basis to tire dealers, wholesale distributors, retail chains, automotive dealers and others, retreading tires and selling retread and other commercial tires through commercial outlets to end users and selling tires directly to consumers via the internet. Terrys Tire operated 10 distribution centers spanning from Virginia to Maine and in Ohio. The acquisition of Terrys Tire will enhance the Companys market position in these areas and aligns very well with their distribution centers, especially the new distribution centers opened by the Company over the past two years in the Northeast and Ohio. The Terrys Tire acquisition closed for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $378.1 million (the Terrys Tire Purchase Price), consisting of cash consideration of approximately $363.4 million, contingent consideration of $12.5 million and non-cash consideration for debt assumed of $2.2 million. The cash F-56 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) consideration paid for the Terrys Tire Acquisition included estimated working capital adjustments and a portion of consideration contingent on certain events achieved prior to closing. The Terrys Tire Purchase Price was funded by a combination of borrowings under a new senior secured term loan facility, as more fully described in Note 9, and borrowings of approximately $72.5 million under Holdings existing U.S. ABL Facility. The Terrys Tire Purchase Price is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including but not limited to, working capital adjustments. Of the $363.4 million in cash consideration, $41.4 million is held in escrow pending the resolution of the post-closing adjustments and other escrow release conditions in accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and escrow agreement. The acquisition of Terrys Tire was recorded using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with current accounting guidance for business combinations and non-controlling interest. As of the date of these financial statements, the Company is in the process of finalizing intangible asset valuations as well as continuing to evaluate the initial purchase price allocation. Accordingly, management has used its best estimates in the allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated preliminary fair market value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. As additional information is obtained about these assets and liabilities within the measurement period, the Company expects to refine its estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price more accurately. The preliminary allocation of the Terrys Tire Purchase Price is as follows: In thousands Cash $ 7,238 Accounts receivable 42,515 Inventory 101,328 Assets held for sale 3,321 Other current assets 2,203 Deferred income taxes 4,947 Property and equipment 7,072 Intangible asset 201,000 Other assets 541 Total assets acquired 370,165 Accounts payable 78,488 Accrued and other liabilities 3,470 Liabilities held for sale 436 Total liabilities assumed 82,394 Net assets acquired 287,771 Goodwill 90,280 Purchase price $ 378,051 The excess of the purchase price over the amounts allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities is included in goodwill, and amounted to $90.3 million. The premium in the purchase price paid for the acquisition of Terrys Tire primarily reflects the anticipated realization of operational and cost synergies. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable were stated at their historical carrying values, which approximate their fair value, given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Inventory was recorded at fair value, based on computations which considered many factors including the estimated selling price of the inventory, the cost to dispose the inventory as well as the replacement cost of the inventory, where applicable. F-57 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The Company recorded a finite-lived customer list intangible asset based on its estimated fair value of $201.0 million. The estimated useful life of the customer list intangible asset is eighteen years based on the Companys internal estimates to be finalized when the third-party intangible asset valuations are completed. As part of the acquisition of Terrys Tire, the Company acquired Terrys Tires commercial and retread businesses. As the Companys core business does not include commercial and retread operations, the Company decided that it would divest of these businesses. As it is managements intention to divest the commercial and retread businesses during fiscal 2014 and as all held for sale criteria has been met, the related assets and liabilities of the commercial and retread businesses are classified as held for sale within the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. As part of the preliminary purchase price allocation, the estimated fair value of the assets held for sale was $3.3 million, including $2.5 million in current assets and net property and equipment of $0.8 million. The estimated fair value of the liabilities held for sale was $0.4 million of which the entire amount related to current liabilities. As additional information is obtained about these assets and liabilities within the measurement period, the Company expects to refine its estimate of the fair values related to these assets and liabilities. Terrys Tire contributed net sales of approximately $3.9 million to the Company for the period from March 29, 2014 to April 5, 2014. Net income contributed by Terrys Tire since the acquisition date was immaterial.

Hercules Holdings has no material assets or operations other than its ownership of Hercules. Hercules is engaged in the business of purchasing, marketing, distributing and selling replacement tires for passenger cars, trucks, and certain off road vehicles to tire dealers, wholesale distributors, retail distributors and others in the United States, Canada and internationally. Hercules operated 15 distribution centers in the United States, 6 distribution centers in Canada and one warehouse in northern China. Hercules also markets the Hercules brand, which is one of the most sought-after proprietary tire brands in the industry. The acquisition of Hercules will strengthen the Companys presence in major markets such as California, Texas and Florida in addition to increasing its presence in Canada. Additionally, Hercules strong logistics and sourcing capabilities, including a long-standing presence in China, will also allow the Company to capitalize on the growing import market, as well as, providing the ability to expand the international sales of the Hercules brand. Finally, this acquisition, will allow the Company to be a brand marketer of the Hercules brand which today has a 2% market share of the passenger and light truck market in North America and a 3% share of highway truck tires in North America. The Merger closed for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $319.3 million (the Hercules Closing Purchase Price), consisting of net cash consideration of $310.4 million, contingent consideration of $3.5 million and non-cash consideration for debt assumed of $5.4 million. The Hercules Closing Purchase Price includes an estimate for initial working capital adjustments. The Merger Agreement provides for the payment of up to $6.5 million in additional consideration contingent upon the occurrence of certain post-closing events (to the extent payable, the Hercules Additional Purchase Price and, collectively with the Hercules Closing F-58 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Purchase Price, the Hercules Purchase Price). The cash consideration paid for the Merger was funded by a combination of the issuance of additional Senior Subordinated Notes, as more fully described in Note 9, an equity contribution of $50.0 million, as more fully described in Note 14 and borrowings under the Companys credit agreement, as more fully described in Note 9. The Hercules Closing Purchase Price is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including, but not limited to, working capital adjustments. The Merger was recorded using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with current accounting guidance for business combinations and non-controlling interest. As a result, the Hercules Closing Purchase Price has been preliminarily allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair market value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. The preliminary allocation of the Hercules Closing Purchase Price is as follows: In thousands Cash $ 12,187 Accounts receivable 61,610 Inventory 156,652 Other current assets 5,064 Property and equipment 29,970 Intangible assets 155,704 Total assets acquired 421,187 Accounts payable 95,616 Accrued and other liabilities 6,154 Deferred income taxes 69,872 Other liabilities 2,325 Total liabilities assumed 173,967 Net assets acquired 247,220 Goodwill 72,082 Purchase price $ 319,302 The excess of the purchase price over the amounts allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities is included in goodwill, and amounted to $72.1 million. The premium in the purchase price for the Merger primarily relates to growth opportunities associated with the Hercules brand and the anticipated realization of operational and cost synergies. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable were stated at their historical carrying values, which approximate their fair value, given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Inventory was recorded at fair value, based on computations which considered many factors including the estimated selling price of the inventory, the cost to dispose the inventory as well as the replacement cost of the inventory, where applicable.

RTD is a wholesale distributor of tires, tire parts, tire accessories and related equipment in the Ontario and Atlantic provinces of Canada. The acquisition of RTD significantly expanded the Companys presence in the Ontario and Atlantic Provinces of Canada and complemented the Companys current operations in Canada. The acquisition of RTD was completed on April 30, 2013 for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $64.9 million (the Adjusted Purchase Price) which includes initial working capital adjustments. The acquisition of RTD was funded by borrowings under the Companys ABL Facility and FILO Facility, as more fully described in Note 9.

Inventories: Inventories consist primarily of automotive tires, custom wheels and accessories and tire supplies and tools. Reported amounts are valued at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or fair market value. The Company performs periodic assessments to determine the existence of obsolete, slow-moving and non-saleable inventories and records necessary provisions to reduce such inventories to net realizable value. A majority of the Companys tire vendors allow for the return of tire products, subject to certain limitations, specified in supply arrangements with the vendors. In addition, the Companys inventory is collateral under the ABL Facility and the FILO Facility. See Note 9 for further information. As a result of the TriCan, RTD, TDI, WTD, Hercules and Terrys Tire acquisitions, the carrying value of the acquired inventory was increased by $6.3 million, $2.7 million, $0.2 million, $0.5 million, $19.0 million and $12.5 million, respectively, to adjust to estimated fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations. The step-up in inventory value for each acquisition was amortized into cost of goods sold over the period of the Companys normal inventory turns, which approximates two months. Amortization of the inventory step-up included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the quarters ended April 5, 2014 and March 30, 2013 was $19.2 million and $2.2 million, respectively. 6.

As of April 5, 2014, the carrying value of the assets held for sale for these businesses was $3.3 million, including $2.5 million in current assets and net property and equipment of $0.8 million. 7. Goodwill: The Company records as goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Once the final valuation has been performed for each acquisition, adjustments may be recorded. Goodwill is tested and reviewed annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or whenever there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than the carrying amount of the asset. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows: In thousands Balance, December 28, 2013 $ 504,333 Purchase accounting adjustments 128 Acquisitions 162,362 Currency translation (1,876 ) Balance, April 5, 2014 $ 664,947 At April 5, 2014, the Company has recorded goodwill of $664.9 million, of which approximately $115.9 million of net goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes in future periods.

As of April 5, 2014, the outstanding balance of the U.S. FILO Facility was $74.1 million and the outstanding balance of the Canadian FILO Facility was $8.5 million. Borrowings under the U.S. ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, either (a) an Adjusted LIBOR rate determined by reference to LIBOR, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, plus an applicable margin of 2.0% as of April 5, 2014 or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime commercial lending rate published by the Bank of America, N.A. as its prime rate for commercial loans, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (3) the one month-Adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.0% per annum, plus an applicable margin of 1.0% as of April 5, 2014. The applicable margins under the U.S. ABL Facility are subject to step ups and step downs based on average excess borrowing availability under the ABL Facility. Borrowings under the Canadian ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either (a) a Canadian base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the base rate as published by Bank of America, N.A. (acting through its Canada branch) as its base rate, (2) the federal funds rate effective plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (3) the one month-LIBOR rate plus 1.0% per annum, plus an applicable margin of 1.0% as of April 5, 2014, (b) a Canadian prime rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate as published by Bank of America, N.A.

The applicable margins under the Canadian FILO Facility are subject to step ups and step downs based on average excess borrowing availability under the ABL Facility. The U.S. and Canadian borrowing base at any time equals the sum (subject to certain reserves and other adjustments) of:  85% of eligible accounts receivable of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable; plus  The lesser of (a) 70% of the lesser of cost or market value of eligible tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable and (b) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable; plus  The lesser of (a) 50% of the lower of cost or market value of eligible non-tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable and (b) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible non-tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable. The U.S. FILO and the Canadian FILO borrowing base at any time equals the sum (subject to certain reserves and other adjustments) of:  5% of eligible accounts receivable of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable; plus  10% of the net orderly liquidation value of the eligible tire and non-tire inventory of the U.S. or Canadian loan parties, as applicable. All obligations under the U.S. ABL Facility and the U.S. FILO Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and substantially all of ATDIs existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned domestic material restricted subsidiaries, other than Tire Pros Francorp. The Canadian ABL Facility and the Canadian FILO Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by the U.S. loan parties, TriCan and any future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned, material restricted Canadian subsidiaries. Obligations under the U.S. ABL Facility and the U.S. FILO Facility are secured by a first-priority lien on inventory, accounts receivable and related assets and a second-priority lien on substantially all other assets of the U.S. loan parties, subject to certain exceptions. Obligations under the Canadian ABL Facility and the Canadian FILO Facility are secured by a first-priority lien on inventory, accounts receivable and related assets and a second-priority lien on substantially all other assets of the U.S. loan parties and the Canadian loan parties, subject to certain exceptions. F-68 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The ABL Facility and FILO Facility contain customary covenants, including covenants that restricts the Companys ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, enter into guarantees, enter into certain mergers, make certain loans and investments, dispose of assets, prepay certain debt, declare dividends, modify certain material agreements, enter into transactions with affiliates or change the Companys fiscal year. If the amount available for additional borrowings under the ABL Facility is less than the greater of (a) 10.0% of the lesser of (x) the aggregate commitments under the ABL Facility and (y) the aggregate borrowing base and (b) $25.0 million, then the Company would be subject to an additional covenant requiring them to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. As of April 5, 2014, the Companys additional borrowing availability under the ABL Facility was above the required amount and the Company was therefore not subject to the additional covenants. Senior Secured Term Loan In connection with the acquisition of Terrys Tire, on March 28, 2014, ATDI entered into a credit agreement that provided for a senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million (the Term Loan). The Term Loan was issued at a discount of 0.25% which, combined with certain debt issuance costs paid at closing, resulted in net proceeds of approximately $290.9 million. The Term Loan will accrete based on an effective interest rate of 6% to an aggregate accreted value of $300.0 million, the full principal amount at maturity. The net proceeds from the Term Loan were used to finance a portion of the Terrys Tire Purchase Price. The maturity date for the Term Loan is June 1, 2018. During the quarter ended April 5, 2014, the Company paid $9.4 million in debt issuance cost related to the Term Loan. Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, initially, either (a) a Eurodollar rate determined by reference to LIBOR, plus an applicable margin of 4.75% at April 5, 2014 or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (2) the prime commercial lending rate published by the Bank of America, N.A. as its prime rate for commercial loans and (3) the one month Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin of 3.75% as of April 5, 2014. The Eurodollar rate is subject to an interest rate floor of 1.0%. The applicable margins under the Term Loan are subject to a step down based on a consolidated net leverage ratio, as defined in the agreement. All obligations under the Term Loan are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and, subject to certain customary exceptions, all of ATDIs existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned domestic material subsidiaries. Obligations under the Term Loan are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all property, assets and capital stock of ATDI except accounts receivable, inventory and related intangible assets and a second-priority lien on all accounts receivable and related intangible assets. The Term Loan contains customary covenants, including covenants that restrict the Companys ability to incur additional debt, create liens, enter into guarantees, enter into certain mergers, make certain loans and investments, dispose of assets, prepay certain debt, declare dividends, modify certain material agreements, enter into transactions with affiliates, change the nature of the Companys business or change the Companys fiscal year. Subject to certain exceptions, the Company is required to repay the Term Loan in certain circumstances, including with 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% and 0%, as applicable, subject to attaining certain senior secured net leverage ratios) of its annual excess cash flow, as defined in the Term Loan agreement. The Term Loan also contains repayments provision related to non-ordinary course asset or property sales when certain conditions are met, and related to the incurrence of debt that is not permitted under the agreement. F-69 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Senior Secured Notes On May 28, 2010, ATDI issued Senior Secured Notes (Senior Secured Notes) due June 1, 2017 in an aggregate principal amount at maturity of $250.0 million. The Senior Secured Notes were issued at a discount from their principal amount at maturity and generated net proceeds of approximately $240.7 million after debt issuance costs (which represents a non-cash financing activity of $9.3 million). The Senior Secured Notes will accrete based on an effective interest rate of 10% to an aggregate accreted value of $250.0 million, the full principal amount at maturity. The Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 9.75% per annum. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2010. The Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed at any time at the option of ATDI, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price of 107.313% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2013 and May 31, 2014, 104.875% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2014 and May 31, 2015, 102.438% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2015 and May 31, 2016 and 100.0% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2016 and May 31, 2017. The Senior Secured Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and substantially all of ATDIs existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned domestic material restricted subsidiaries, other than Tire Pros Francorp, subject to certain exceptions. The Senior Secured Notes are also collateralized by a second-priority lien on accounts receivable and related assets and a first-priority lien on substantially all other assets (other than inventory), in each case of Holdings, ATDI and the guarantor subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limits ATDIs ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock; pay certain dividends or make certain distributions in respect of ATDIs or repurchase or redeem ATDIs capital stock; make certain loans, investments or other restricted payments; place restrictions on the ability of ATDIs subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to ATDI; engage in transactions with stockholders or affiliates; transfer or sell certain assets; guarantee indebtedness or incur other contingent obligations; incur certain liens; consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of ATDIs assets; enter into certain transactions with ATDIs affiliates; and designate ATDIs subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. Senior Subordinated Notes On May 28, 2010, ATDI issued $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 11.50% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the Initial Subordinated Notes). Interest on the Initial Subordinated Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2010. In connection with the consummation of the Hercules acquisition, on January 31, 2014, ATDI completed the sale to certain purchasers of an additional $225.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 11.50% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the Additional Subordinated Notes and, collectively with the Initial Subordinated Notes, the Senior Subordinated Notes). The Additional Subordinated Notes were issued at a discount from their principal amount at maturity and generated net proceeds of approximately $221.1 million. The Additional Subordinated Notes will accrete based on an effective interest rate of 12% to an aggregate accreted value of $225.0 million, the full principal amount at maturity. During the quarter ended April 5, 2014, the Company paid $1.2 million in debt issuance cost related to the Additional Subordinated Notes. The Additional Subordinated Notes have identical terms to the Initial Subordinated Notes except the Additional Subordinated Notes will accrue interest from January 31, 2014. The Additional Subordinated Notes and the Initial Subordinated Notes are treated as a single class of securities for all purposes under the indenture. The Senior Subordinated Notes will mature on June 1, 2018. F-70 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The Senior Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at any time at the option of ATDI, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price of 104.0% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2013 and May 31, 2014, 102.0% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2014 and May 31, 2015 and 100.0% of the principal amount if the redemption date occurs between June 1, 2015 and May 31, 2016. The Senior Subordinated Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and substantially all of ATDIs existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned domestic material restricted subsidiaries, other than Tire Pros Francorp, subject to certain exceptions. The indenture governing the Senior Subordinated Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limits ATDIs ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock; pay certain dividends or make certain distributions in respect of ATDIs or repurchase or redeem ATDIs capital stock; make certain loans, investments or other restricted payments; place restrictions on the ability of ATDIs subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to ATDI; engage in transactions with stockholders or affiliates; transfer or sell certain assets; guarantee indebtedness or incur other contingent obligations; incur certain liens without securing the Senior Subordinated Notes; consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of ATDIs assets; enter into certain transactions with ATDIs affiliates; and designate ATDIs subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. 10. Derivative Instruments: In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the risk associated with exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt. These fluctuations can increase the cost of financing, investing and operating the business. The Company has used derivative financial instruments to help manage this risk and reduce the impacts of these exposures and not for trading or other speculative purposes. All derivatives are recognized on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at their fair value as either assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, and are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income (loss) at the time earnings are affected by the hedged transaction. For other derivatives, changes in the fair value of the contract are recognized immediately in net income (loss) in the statement of comprehensive income (loss). On September 4, 2013, the Company entered into a spot interest rate swap and two forward-starting interest rate swaps (collectively the 3Q 2013 Swaps) each of which are used to hedge a portion of the Companys exposure to changes in its variable interest rate debt. The spot interest rate swap in place covers a notional amount of $100.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 1.145% and expires in September 2016. The forward-starting interest rate swaps in place cover an aggregate notional amount of $100.0 million, of which $50.0 million becomes effective in September 2014 at a fixed interest rate of 1.464% and will expire in September 2016 and $50.0 million becomes effective in September 2015 at a fixed interest rate of 1.942% and will expire in September 2016. The counterparty to each swap is a major financial institution. The 3Q 2013 Swaps do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, changes in the fair value of each contract is recognized in net income (loss) in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). On August 1, 2012, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements (3Q 2012 Swaps) used to hedge a portion of the Companys exposure to changes in its variable interest rate debt. The swaps in place cover an aggregate notional amount of $100.0 million, with each $50.0 million contract having a fixed rate of 0.655% and expiring in June 2016. The counterparty to each swap is a major financial institution. The 3Q F-71 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 2012 Swaps do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, changes in the fair value of each contract is recognized in net income (loss) in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). On September 23, 2011, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements (3Q 2011 Swaps) used to hedge a portion of the Companys exposure to changes in its variable interest rate debt. The swaps in place cover an aggregate notional amount of $100.0 million, of which $50.0 million is at a fixed rate of 0.74% and will expire in September 2014 and $50.0 million is at a fixed rate of 1.0% and will expire in September 2015. The counterparty to each swap is a major financial institution. The 3Q 2011 Swaps do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, changes in the fair value of each contract is recognized in net income (loss) in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). On February 24, 2011, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements (1Q 2011 Swaps) used to hedge a portion of the Companys exposure to changes in its variable interest rate debt. The swaps in place covered an aggregate notional amount of $75.0 million, of which $25.0 million was at a fixed interest rate of 0.585% and expired in February 2012. The remaining swap covered an aggregate notional amount of $50.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 1.105% and expired in February 2013. The counterparty to each swap was a major financial institution. Neither swap met the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, changes in the fair value of each contract were recognized in net income (loss) in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). The following tables present the fair values of the Companys derivative instruments included within the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of April 5, 2014 and December 28, 2013: Liability Derivatives In thousands Balance Sheet Location April 5, 2014 December 28, 2013 Derivatives not designated as hedges: 3Q 2011 swaps$100 million notional Accrued expenses $ 705 $ 792 3Q 2012 swaps$100 million notional Accrued expenses 328 280 3Q 2013 swaps$200 million notional Accrued expenses 1,915 1,880 Total $ 2,948 $ 2,952 The pre-tax effect of the Companys derivative instruments on the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) was as follows: (Gain) Loss Recognized In thousands Location of (Gain) Loss Recognized Quarter Ended April 5, 2014 Quarter Ended March 30, 2013 Derivatives not designated as hedges: 1Q 2011 swap$50 million notional Interest Expense $  $ (149 ) 3Q 2011 swaps$100 million notional Interest Expense (86 ) (156 ) 3Q 2012 swaps$100 million notional Interest Expense 47 (131 ) 3Q 2013 swaps$200 million notional Interest Expense 35  Total $ (4 ) $ (436 ) F-72 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The accounting standard for fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value that is based on the inputs market participants use to determine the fair value of an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy to prioritize those inputs. The fair value hierarchy is comprised of three levels that are described below:  Level 1 Inputs Inputs based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 Inputs Inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs based on little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances. A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table presents the fair value and hierarchy levels for the Companys assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of April 5, 2014: Fair Value Measurements In thousands Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Benefit trust assets $ 3,359 $ 3,359 $  $  Total $ 3,359 $ 3,359 $  $  Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 16,000 $  $  $ 16,000 Derivative instruments 2,948  2,948  Total $ 18,948 $  $ 2,948 $ 16,000 ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company determines fair value of its financial assets and liabilities using the following methodologies:  Benefit trust assets These assets include money market and mutual funds that are the underlying for deferred compensation plan assets, held in a rabbi trust. The fair value of the assets is based on observable market prices quoted in readily accessible and observable markets. F-73 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  Contingent consideration As part of the preliminary purchase price allocation of Terrys Tire and Hercules, the Company recorded $12.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively, in contingent consideration. The fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow technique with significant inputs that are not observable, including discount rates and probability-weighted cash flows and represents managements best estimate of the amounts to be paid, however, the Company is in the process of obtaining third-party appraisals of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities and will continue to evaluate amounts recorded until the appraisals are finalized. The contingent consideration includes $12.3 million related to the retention of certain key members of management as employees of the Company and $3.7 million related to securing the rights to continue to distribute certain tire brands previously distributed by Terrys Tire and Hercules. The Company believes the probable outcome could range from approximately $8.0 million to $16.0 million. The recorded contingent consideration is included in Accrued Expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of April 5, 2014.  Derivative instruments These instruments consist of interest rate swaps. The fair value is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments from a financial institution that is counterparty to the transaction. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The methodologies used by the Company to determine the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities at April 5, 2014 are the same as those used at December 28, 2013. As a result, there have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 categories. 12. Stock-Based Compensation: The Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation , which requires a fair-value based method for measuring the value of stock-based compensation. Fair value is measured once at the date of grant and is not adjusted for subsequent changes. The Companys stock-based compensation plans include programs for stock options and restricted stock units. Stock Options In August 2010, the Company adopted a Management Equity Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan), pursuant to which the Company will grant options to selected employees and directors of the Company. The 2010 Plan, which includes both time-based and performance-based awards, provides that a maximum of 52.1 million shares of common stock of the Company are available for grant. As of April 5, 2014, the Company has 2.5 million shares available for future incentive awards. See Note 16 regarding a recent amendment to the 2010 Plan and the issuance of stock options subsequent to the quarter ended April 5, 2014. F-74 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Changes in options outstanding under the 2010 Plan are as follows: Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price OutstandingDecember 28, 2013 49,516,503 $ 1.02 Granted   Exercised   Cancelled   OutstandingApril 5, 2014 49,516,503 $ 1.02 ExercisableApril 5, 2014 27,861,510 $ 1.01 Options granted under the 2010 Plan expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant and vest based on the passage of time and/or the achievement of certain performance targets in equal installments over three or five years. The weighted-average remaining contractual term for options outstanding and exercisable at April 5, 2014 was 6.7 years and 6.6 years, respectively. The fair value of each of the Companys time-based stock option awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the three or five-year vesting period of the options. However, for options granted with performance target requirements, compensation expense is recognized when it is probable that both the performance target will be achieved and the requisite service period is satisfied. At April 5, 2014, unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested options granted under the 2010 Plan totaled $7.0 million and the weighted-average period over which this expense will be recognized is 1.1 years. No stock options were granted during the quarter ended April 5, 2014. The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the quarter ended March 30, 2013 was $0.54 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used: Quarter Ended March 30, 2013 Risk-free interest rate 1.38 % Dividend yield  Expected life 6.0 years Volatility 45.39 % As the Company does not have sufficient historical volatility data for the Companys own common stock, the stock price volatility utilized in the fair value calculation is based on the Companys peer group in the industry in which it does business. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield-curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award. Because the Company does not have relevant data available regarding the expected life of the award, the expected life is derived from the Simplified Method as allowed under SAB Topic 14. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) In October 2010, the Company adopted the Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Plan (the 2010 RSU Plan), pursuant to which the Company will grant restricted stock units to non-employee directors of the F-75 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Company. Upon vesting, these awards entitle the holder to receive one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit granted. The 2010 RSU Plan provides that a maximum of 0.8 million shares of common stock of the Company may be granted to non-employee directors of the Company, of which 0.3 million remain available at April 5, 2014 for future incentive awards. See Note 16 regarding the issuance of RSUs subsequent to the quarter ended April 5, 2014. The following table summarizes RSU activity under the 2010 RSU Plan for the three months ended April 5, 2014: Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding and unvested at December 28, 2013 87,719 $ 1.14 Granted   Vested (87,719 ) 1.14 Cancelled   Outstanding and unvested at April 5, 2014  $  The fair value of each of the RSU awards is measured as the grant-date price of the common stock and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the two-year vesting period. At April 5, 2014, all RSUs granted under the 2010 RSU Plan are fully vested and accordingly, the Company has recognized all compensation expense related these RSUs. Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses within the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). The amount of compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the granted awards that are expected to vest. Ultimately, the total expense recognized over the vesting period will equal the fair value of the awards as of the grant date that actually vest. The following table summarizes the compensation expense recognized: In thousands Quarter Ended April 5, 2014 Quarter Ended March 30, 2013 Stock Options $ 567 $ 626 Restricted Stock Units  42 Total $ 567 $ 668 13. Income Taxes: The tax provision for the quarter ended April 5, 2014, was calculated on a national jurisdiction basis. The Company accounts for its provision for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes , which requires an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to be applied to the respective interim period. However, the authoritative guidance allows the use of the discrete method when, in certain situations, the actual interim period effective tax rate provides a better estimate of the income tax provision. For the quarter ended April 5, 2014, the discrete method was used to calculate the Companys U.S. and Canadian interim tax expense as management determined that it provided a more reliable estimate of year-to-date income tax expense. F-76 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Based on the reported loss before income taxes for the quarter ended April 5, 2014, the Company had an income tax benefit of $16.6 million, consisting of a $14.3 million U.S. tax benefit and a $2.3 million foreign tax benefit, and an effective tax benefit rate under the discrete method of 32.8%. For the quarter ended March 30, 2013, the Company had an income tax benefit of $7.6 million, consisting of a $6.4 million U.S. tax benefit and a $1.2 million foreign tax benefit, and an effective tax benefit rate of 31.9%. The effective rate of the year-to-date tax benefit is lower than the statutory income tax rate primarily due to earnings in a foreign jurisdiction taxed at rates lower than the statutory U.S. federal rate which lowered the effective tax rate by 1.5%. At April 5, 2014, the Company has a net deferred tax liability of $309.0 million, of which, $17.3 million was recorded as a current deferred tax asset and $326.3 million was recorded as a non-current deferred tax liability. The net deferred tax liability primarily relates to the expected future tax liability associated with the non-deductible, identified, intangible assets that were recorded during the TPG Merger, assuming an effective tax rate of 39.6%. It is the Companys intention to indefinitely reinvest all undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. At April 5, 2014, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $1.1 million, of which $0.4 million is included within accrued expenses and $0.7 million is included within other liabilities within the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate is $0.1 million as of April 5, 2014. In addition, $1.0 million is related to temporary timing differences. During the next 12 months, management does not believe that it is reasonably possible that any of the unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized. While the Company believes that it has adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than the Companys accrued position. Accordingly, additional provisions of federal and state-related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. The Company files federal income tax returns, as well as multiple state jurisdiction tax returns. The tax years 2010  2012 remain open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The tax years 2009  2012 remain open to examination by other major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject (primarily Canada and other state and local jurisdictions). In September 2013, the Internal Revenue Service released final Tangible Property Regulations (the Final Regulations). The Final Regulations provide guidance on applying Section 263(a) of the Code to amounts paid to acquire, produce or improve tangible property, as well as rules for materials and supplies (Code Section 162). These regulations contain certain changes from the temporary and proposed tangible property regulations that were issued on December 27, 2011. The Final Regulations are generally effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. During 2012, the Company filed a change in tax methodology related to a section of the Final Regulations, specifically the methodology for repairs and maintenance deductions. The Company does not expect any additional adjustments related to the Final Regulations. 14. Stockholders Equity: On January 31, 2014, TPG and certain co-investors contributed $50.0 million through the purchase of 33.3 million shares of the Companys common stock. The proceeds from this equity contribution were used to fund a portion of the Hercules Closing Purchase Price. Accordingly, the Company recorded the basis in these shares in additional paid-in capital. 15. Commitments and Contingencies: The Company is involved from time to time in various lawsuits, including class action lawsuits as well as various audits and reviews regarding its federal, state and local tax filings, arising out of the ordinary conduct F-77 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) of its business. Management does not expect that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys business or financial condition. As to tax filings, the Company believes that the various tax filings have been made in a timely fashion and in accordance with applicable federal, state and local tax code requirements. Additionally, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of any tax disputes, but will adjust its reserves if events so dictate in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance. To the extent that the ultimate results differ from the original or adjusted estimates of the Company, the effect will be recorded in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes. Guaranteed Lease Obligations The Company remains liable as a guarantor on certain leases related to the Winston Tire Company, which was sold in 2001. As of April 5, 2014, the Companys total obligations are $1.8 million extending over five years. However, the Company has secured assignments or sublease agreements for the vast majority of these commitments with contractual assigned or subleased rentals of $1.6 million. A provision has been made for the net present value of the estimated shortfall. 16. Earnings per share: Basic earnings per share is calculated using the Companys weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the Companys weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units as determined under the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the quarters ended April 5, 2014 and March 30, 2012: In thousands, except per share data Quarter Ended April 5, 2014 Quarter Ended March 30, 2013 Basic earnings per share calculation: Net income (loss) $ (34,044 ) $ (16,291 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding 756,390 734,168 Net income (loss) per sharebasic $ (0.05 ) $ (0.02 ) Diluted earnings per share calculation: Net income (loss) $ (34,044 ) $ (16,291 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding 756,391 734,168 Effect of dilutive securities: Stock Options (1)   Restricted Stock Units (2)   Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 756,391 734,168 Net income (loss) per sharediluted $ (0.05 ) $ (0.02 ) (1) Options to purchase 49,517 and 50,182 shares of common stock during the quarters ended April 5, 2014 and March 30, 2013, respectively, were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. (2) Shares of common stock issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units of 447 and 469 during the quarters ended April 5, 2014 and March 30, 2013, respectively, were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. F-78 ATD Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 17. Subsequent Event: On April 28, 2014, the board of directors of the Company amended the Management Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2010 Plan, to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock of the Company for which stock options may be granted under the 2010 Plan from 52.1 million to 54.4 million. In addition to the increase in the maximum number of shares, on April 28, 2014 the board of directors of the Company approved the issuance of stock options to certain members of management and the issuance of restricted stock units to the non-employee directors of the Company. The approved stock options are for the purchase of up to 4.5 million shares of common stock, have an exercise price of $1.50 per share and vest over a two-year vesting period. The approved restricted stock units are for the issuance of up to 0.1 million shares of common stock, have a grant date fair value of $1.50 per share and vest over a two-year vesting period. Subsequent events were evaluated for recognition through May 16, 2014, the original issuance date of our subsidiary American Tire Distributors Holdings, Inc.s financial statements. Subsequent events were evaluated for disclosure through June 16, 2014, the date of reissuance.

Managements Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Companys preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TTT Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. /s/

Description of Business TTT Holdings, Inc. (Holdings) is incorporated in Delaware as an S-Corporation. Terrys Tire Town Holdings, Inc. (TTT), its wholly owned subsidiary, is incorporated in Ohio as an S-corporation. Through its operating subsidiaries, TTTs primary operations are as a wholesale distributor of tires and accessories throughout the eastern half of the United States. During 2011, TTT formed Summit Tire Northeast, LLC (Summit) to acquire the assets of Summit Tire of Massachusetts, Inc., a wholesale tire distributor with operations focused in the New England area and TTT directly acquired the stock of Englewood Tire Wholesale, Inc. (Englewood), a wholesale tire distributor with operations focused primarily in the Greater New York, New Jersey and Connecticut area. Holdings has no significant assets or operations other than its ownership of TTT. The operations of TTT constitutes the operations of Holdings. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Holdings, TTT and each of TTTs wholly owned subsidiaries and entities controlled by TTT but not wholly-owned (collectively the Company). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of equity the Company does not own in the controlled entities included in the financial statements. The Company identifies its noncontrolling interests separately within the equity section on the consolidated balance sheet. The amounts of consolidated net earnings attributable to the Company and to the noncontrolling interests are presented separately on the Companys consolidated statement of operations. The Company dissolved its noncontrolling interests in 2012. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates include the Companys valuation of doubtful accounts receivable, valuation of inventory reserves, valuation of goodwill, share-based compensation, the fair value of derivative instruments, the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities, including intangible assets and related useful lives assigned to such assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties to be cash and cash equivalents. Such investments are carried at their cost, which approximates their estimated fair market value. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The majority of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were deposited with large banking institutions. The Company maintains cash deposits in banks which, from time to time, exceed the amount of deposit insurance available. Management periodically assesses the financial condition of the institutions and believes that any potential credit loss is minimal. F-86 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2013 and 2012 Accounts Receivable Trade receivables represent amounts due from product sales in the ordinary course of business. Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of customers financial condition, and trade receivables are generally not collateralized. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable losses for uncollected receivables. The Company determines the allowance based on customer risk, the length of time accounts are past due, and historical write-off experience. Account balances are charged to the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The total adjustment to reduce accounts receivable to the recoverable amount was $2,042,500 and $2,885,703 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Inventories Inventories consist of products held for resale and are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined by the last-in, first-out method (LIFO) for tire inventory and at moving average cost for non-tire inventory. The LIFO reserve was $202,520 and $4,576,974 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The composition of inventory valued at LIFO and FIFO is as follows: 2013 2012 Inventory at LIFO (primarily tire inventory) $ 88,076,680 $ 101,192,482 Inventory at FIFO (primarily nontire inventory) 4,448,607 4,301,739 $ 92,525,287 $ 105,494,221 During 2013, the combination of deflation and reduction in inventory quantities resulted in a liquidation of LIFO inventory carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with the cost of 2012 purchases, the effect of which decreased cost of goods sold and increased net income by approximately $4,374,000. The portion related to the change in cost in inventory compared to 2012 was approximately $537,000. The above balances are presented net for slow-moving and obsolete inventory of $1,217,681 and $1,101,894 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Derivative Instruments The Companys interest rate risk management strategy uses derivative instruments to minimize cash flow risks caused by interest rate volatility associated with the Companys variable rate debt. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the derivative instruments used to meet the Companys risk management objectives were interest rate swaps. The Company chose not to apply hedge accounting for its interest rate swap agreements. Accordingly, the interest rate swaps are carried at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet, with changes in their fair value recognized in current earnings (see Note 12). Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs are included in other noncurrent assets and represent the direct costs of establishing the Companys term and revolving debt. Deferred financing costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method for term commitments and the straight-line method for revolving commitments. F-87 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2013 and 2012 Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. The cost and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated from the accounts and resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the asset. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Leasehold improvements 5  25 years Machinery and equipment 7 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Vehicles 5 years Computer software and equipment 3 years Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of customer relationships and trade names. The intangible assets were determined to have finite lives. Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is recorded to reflect the pattern of economic benefits based on projected revenues over their respective estimated useful lives. Intangible assets are amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives (customer relationships11 to 13 years and trade names3 to 18 years). Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company assesses the recoverability of property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable from its future undiscounted cash flows. If it is determined an impairment has occurred, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. No impairments were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment and between annual tests, if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment exists, using a fair value-based approach. Any such impairment is recognized in the period identified. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company identifies goodwill related to each of its reporting units. The Company has determined it operates in two reporting units: wholesale and commercial. For purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment, assets and liabilities, including goodwill, were allocated to each reporting unit on the basis of relative fair value of each unit. No impairment of goodwill was recorded in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when products are shipped or when title transfers to customers, if later, net of estimated returns and customer discounts. F-88 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2013 and 2012 Supplier Incentives The Company receives monthly, quarterly and annual performance rebates from suppliers based on attaining certain purchase and/or sales goals. The Company receives other rebates from suppliers which are negotiated with suppliers and are not dependent on the Company meeting minimum purchase and/or sales goals. Suppliers rebates are recognized ratably based on the terms of the contracts or programs with each supplier and are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold. Supplier rebates are classified as a reduction of inventory when the incentive is part of a buying arrangement. Receivables from suppliers for rebates and incentives are included in other receivables in the consolidated balance sheet. Shipping and Handling Costs The Company includes in cost of goods sold the cost of tire and non-tire inventory sold. Warehousing and distribution costs, including costs associated with delivering product to customers are included in operating expenses. Total warehousing and distribution costs for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were approximately $39,148,000 and $37,992,000 respectively including approximately $14,619,000 and $14,842,000, respectively, related to shipping and handling. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed when incurred as part of operating expenses. The Company receives reimbursements from vendors for advertising costs. Reimbursements for advertising expenditures are reported on a net basis within operating expenses. Reimbursements received in excess of the cost of advertising are reported within cost of goods sold. Net advertising costs were $127,301 and $180,924 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for equity awards provided to employees in return for employee service. The Company issued both time vesting and performance-based stock options to certain employees. Time vesting options are measured at the fair value of the award at the grant date and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period. The performance-based options vest in tranches based on the Company meeting annual earnings targets and also contain a service requirement. Compensation expense for performance-based options is recorded over the relevant service period when it becomes probable that the contingent performance measures are expected to be met. Fair value is measured at the grant date and amortized on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Income Taxes There is no provision for federal and certain state income taxes in the consolidated financial statements of the Company, as an S-corporation is generally not subject to these taxes. Stockholders are individually subject to the income taxes on the Companys results of operations and, accordingly, the Company pays distributions to the members to the extent needed to fund the stockholders tax obligations. Certain state and local jurisdictions do not recognize the flow-through status of an S-corporation and require minimum income tax expense. Accordingly, the Company has recognized a state and local income tax in the accompanying statement of operations for these jurisdictions. F-89 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2013 and 2012 3. Business Acquisitions Kramer Tire On May 13, 2012, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets associated with the wholesale distribution operations of two facilities located in Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia, from Monro Muffler Brake, Inc. The intent of the acquisition was to increase operations in the Mid-Atlantic market and reinforce relationships with Monro Muffler Brake, Inc. The purchase price was $2,267,338 paid in cash. The purchase was accounted for on the acquisition method and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill of $255,285 was recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Transaction costs of $114,000 were expensed in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012. The purchase price was allocated as follows: Assets Inventories $ 1,433,277 Intangible assets 656,088 Goodwill 255,285 Other assets 12,480 Total assets acquired 2,357,130 Total liabilities assumed (89,792 ) Fair value of net assets acquired $ 2,267,338 The estimated fair value of net assets acquired, including the allocation of the fair value to identifiable assets and liabilities, was determined using Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy (see Fair Value Measurements in Note 13). The most significant assumptions include estimated remaining useful life, expected revenue, survivor curve, and earnings before interest and tax margins. These assumptions may vary based on future events, perceptions of different market participants and other factors outside the control of management, and such variations may be significant to estimated values. 4.

Short-Term Note Payable During 2013, the company entered into a financing arrangement with a third party to fund commercial insurance prepayments. The amount financed was approximately $1,927,000 at an annual interest rate of 3.12%. Payments are made in equal monthly installments of $177,899 with final payment due on September 1, 2014. The remaining balance of this arrangement at December 31, 2013 is $1,406,762. F-92 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2013 and 2012 10. Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations Long-term debt and capital lease obligations consisted of the following at December 31: 2013 2012 Term loan $ 30,468,047 $ 38,035,718 Revolving loan 17,000,000 3,780,002 Subordinated loan 39,001,131 38,703,833 Seller note 11,082,428 10,632,877 Capital leases 301,945  Other debt 1,090,498 316,541 Total 98,944,049 91,468,971 Less: Original issue discount on the subordinated loan (459,184 ) (599,490 ) Total 98,484,865 90,869,481 Less: Current maturities (7,005,747 ) (7,676,809 ) Total long-term debt and capital lease obligations $ 91,479,118 $ 83,192,672 Term and Revolving Debt On November 30, 2011, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Agreement) consisting of revolving and term debt with a lender group. The Agreement, which was amended on March 29, 2013, is collateralized by substantially all of the Companys assets, but subordinate to certain vendor senior collateral positions. The revolving commitment, including outstanding letters of credit, is available up to the lesser of $45,000,000 or an agreed-upon percentage of the Companys accounts receivable and inventory and has a maturity date of November 30, 2016. The Company is required to pay commitment fees up to 0.375% per annum on the unused portion of the revolving commitment. In connection with one of the Companys leased facilities, an outstanding letter of credit is open for $94,444, and expires on December 20, 2014. The term debt requires monthly principal payments of $535,714 through November 30, 2016. The remaining outstanding principal is due on November 30, 2016. The Agreement also contains provisions which, under certain circumstances, require the Company to make prepayments of the term loan commitment beginning in 2012, based on excess cash flows as defined in the Agreement. Interest on the revolving loan and term loan is payable monthly based on 30 day LIBOR plus a margin that fluctuates between 2.25% and 3.50% based on the Companys leverage ratio, as defined in the Agreement. At December 31, 2013, the margin was 3.50% with a total rate of 3.67%. At December 31, 2012, the margin was 2.75% with a total rate of 2.96%. During 2013, the Company was in default of certain covenants under the agreement and entered into Forbearance Agreements dated October 23, 2013 and December 30, 2013 (the Forbearance Agreements). Subsequent to December 31, 2013 the company entered into the Credit Agreement Amendment (see Note 19) and the Forbearance Agreements have terminated. F-93 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2013 and 2012 Subordinated Loan On November 30, 2011, the Company entered into a subordinated credit agreement (the Subordinated Loan) with a lender. The Subordinated Loan, which was amended on March 29, 2013, consists of term debt which is due in full on November 30, 2017. This term debt was issued at an original issue discount of $765,306. The Company amortizes the original issue discount over the life of the loan commitment using the effective interest method. The Subordinated Loan also contains provisions which, under certain circumstances, require the Company to make prepayments of the loan commitment beginning in 2013, based on excess cash flows as defined in the Subordinated Loan. The Subordinated Loan is unsecured and bears interest at 13.5%, of which at least 12% shall be payable in cash quarterly, through maturity. The remaining 1.5% may be paid in kind and added to the principal balance, at the Companys option. During a portion of fiscal year 2013, the Company was in default of certain provisions under the Subordinated Loan. During the period of default, the Company was charged an incremental default interest rate of 2.00%. Subsequent to December 31, 2013, the Company entered into the Subordinated Credit Amendment (see Note 19) and is no longer in default under that agreement. The Subordinated Loan allows for optional prepayments at redemption prices ranging from 100% to 103%, based on the date of the redemption. During a portion of fiscal year 2013, interest payments under the Subordinated Loan were accrued and not paid current. These amounts are included in accrued liabilities (see Note 8). The Credit Agreement Amendment allows for the current payments of interest on the subordinated loan and the repayment of accrued interest during fiscal year 2014. The Agreement and the Subordinated Loan contain certain restrictive financial covenants, which specify minimum net worth requirements, maximum liabilities to earnings before income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) ratio and a minimum ratio of EBITDA to debt service cost, among others. The Company is also required to meet certain non-financial covenants, which include restrictions on indebtedness, liens and dividends. Seller Note The Company has a credit agreement with a former shareholder of the predecessor Company (the Seller Note) that matures on May 31, 2018. No principal payments are required to be made until the maturity date. The Seller Note bears interest at an annual rate of 13%, of which at least 10% is payable in cash on a quarterly basis, through maturity. The remaining 3% is considered paid-in-kind interest and is added to the principal balance. The Seller Note is subordinate to the Companys other financing arrangements. During a portion of 2013, interest payments under the Seller Note were accrued and not paid current. These amounts are included in accrued liabilities (see Note 8). The Credit Agreement Amendment allows for the current payments of interest on the Seller Note and the repayment of accrued interest during fiscal year 2014. Other Debt The Companys other debt obligations primarily consist of vendor financing for ERP software. The obligation bears interest at an annual rate of 2% and equal quarterly payments are due until November 2015. At December 31, 2013, the outstanding balance for this obligation was approximately $1,075,000. F-94 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2013 and 2012 Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt and capital lease obligations are as follows: 2014 $ 7,005,747 2015 7,013,210 2016 34,654,724 2017 39,051,558 2018 11,140,548 Thereafter 78,262 $ 98,944,049 11. Commitments and Contingencies Leases The Company leases certain warehouse facilities, office facilities and vehicles under both capital and operating leases expiring at various dates through November 2020. The leases require the Company to pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other operating expenses applicable to the leased facilities. The terms of certain warehouse and office facility leases call for minimum rents to increase each year. Accordingly, the Company has accounted for the rent expense under the straight-line method. At December 31, 2013, future minimum lease payments for all leases and the present value of the net minimum lease payments for capital leases were as follows: Operating Leases Capital Leases Total Related Parties Total 2014 $ 8,135,719 $ 2,113,788 $ 73,259 2015 6,387,041 2,002,124 73,259 2016 4,289,523 773,820 73,259 2017 3,960,236 773,820 73,259 2018 4,083,657 773,820 73,259 Thereafter 8,678,393 1,483,155 85,051 Total minimum lease payments $ 35,534,569 $ 7,920,527 451,346 Less: Amounts representing interest 149,401 Present value of net minimum lease payments 301,945 Less: Current maturities 33,205 Long-term obligations under capital leases $ 268,740 Total rent expense charged to operations, including $2,234,788 and $2,245,788 to related parties, was $10,746,232 and $9,857,191 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Legal Contingent liabilities arise in the ordinary course of the Companys activities. Various legal actions, proceedings and claims may be instituted or asserted in the future against the Company. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal proceedings and claims could be decided unfavorably to the Company. Based on information presently known, management does not believe any claims will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operation. F-95 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2013 and 2012 Vendor Liens The Company has agreements with certain inventory suppliers whereby the Companys accounts payable to these suppliers ($64,083,743 and $85,713,000 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively) is collateralized by the Companys inventory and accounts receivable. Their rights are senior to those of the debt holders (see Note 10). Other The Company has an unconditional obligation with a supplier for software maintenance services of approximately $416,000 in both 2014 and 2015. 12. Derivative Instruments The Company has two separate interest rate swap agreements with a lender for the purpose of reducing certain exposures to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate term debt. The notional amount of each of the swaps is $25,000,000. In accordance with the swap agreements, the Company pays a fixed rate of interest of 2.10% and 2.12% plus the applicable spread, and receives a floating rate of the lenders LIBOR rate plus the applicable spread. One of the swap agreements expires in November 2015 and the other swap agreement expires in January 2016. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was $(779,412) and $(1,341,780). The resulting change in fair value was included as a decrease in interest expense, net and was $562,368 and $224,525 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 13. Fair Value Measurements The Company measures or monitors certain assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is used on a recurring basis for assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting, mainly derivative instruments. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principle or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The Company applies the fair value hierarchy, and when possible looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets and liabilities. If identical assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 3 Unobservable inputs based on the Companys own assumptions. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the Companys financial instruments as of December 31, 2013: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Liabilities Derivative instruments $  $ 779,412 $  $ 779,412 Long-term debt   98,484,865 98,484,865 F-96 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2013 and 2012 The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the Companys financial instruments as of December 31, 2012: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Liabilities Derivative instruments $  $ 1,341,780 $  $ 1,341,780 Long-term debt   90,869,481 90,869,481 The fair value of the Companys interest rate swaps are estimated using discounted cash flows that use market observable inputs of forward interest rate yield curves and a Company-specific risk adjusted discount rate. The fair value of long-term debt reflects the present value of future cash outflows relating to the obligation based on estimated credit market interest premiums and expected future interest rates. The carrying amounts reported on the consolidated balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments. 14. Stockholders Equity Common shares are entitled to one vote per share on all matters upon which stockholders have the right to vote under law or the Companys Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement (the Stockholders Agreement), which was amended on November 30, 2011. On August 13, 2013, the stockholders of the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement (the Subscription) to acquire $20,000,000 of voting common stock at a price of $1,000 per share (a total of 20,000 shares), based on their pro-rata ownership position in the Company. On October 17, 2013, the stockholders purchased 5,000 shares under the Subscription in the amount of $5,000,000. As of December 31, 2013, there are 15,000 remaining shares available for purchase. The Stockholders Agreement also provides for annual tax distributions on the taxable income allocated to each stockholder. The Company is authorized to issue 15,000 non-voting shares, none of which are outstanding at December 31, 2013 or 2012. 15. Mezzanine Equity Two stockholders have the right to require the Company to purchase up to approximately half of their respective common shares at a future date (the Put Options). The Put Options are exercisable at the option of the holder for a 90 day window beginning on November 23, 2015 and November 23, 2018 for one of the stockholders and November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2019 for the second stockholder. If the Put Options are exercised, the Company would purchase the put common shares at a price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the put option exercise date. As the Put Options are a redemption right which is outside the Companys control, under Regulation S-X, the Company should have classified this redeemable common stock in the mezzanine equity section in the accompanying Balance Sheets at its redemption value, which is equal to fair value, and recorded changes in fair value to Additional paid-in capital since the Company has an accumulated deficit. The financial statements previously presented the redeemable common stock within Stockholders Equity. The 2013 and 2012 Balance Sheets and Statement of Stockholders Equity have been revised to correct the misstatement in presentation of the redeemable common stock as Mezzanine Equity. The impact of this revision is as follows and was not material to the current or prior year financial statements. F-97 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2013 and 2012 Total stockholders equity at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was reduced by $8,875,516, $14,212,482, and $11,406,620, respectively primarily reflecting a reduction in Additional paid-in capital, and Mezzanine Equity was increased at December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 by the same amounts. There was no effect on the statements of operations or cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013 or 2012. 16. Stock Based Compensation The Company has 8,000 nonvoting common shares authorized for issuance under TTT Holdings Equity Incentive Plan (Equity Incentive Plan). As of December 31, 2013, the Equity Incentive Plan had 3,661 nonvoting common shares available for granting. The Equity Incentive Plan permits the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock or stock options, as determined by the Companys Board of Directors. To date, the Company has stock options which expire no later than ten years from the date of grant and will become exercisable as directed by the Board of Directors. The time vesting stock options generally vest in equal annual installments over a three-year period, while the performance based stock options vest in tranches based on the Company meeting annual earnings targets and also contain a service requirement. Stock-based compensation expense was $538,010 and $418,006 during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which was recorded in operating expenses in the statement of operations. Of the total stock-based compensation expense recognized, $0 was related to performance-based options during both years ending December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense is based on the grant-date fair value. The fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of comparable public companies for a period equal to the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury interest rates with a remaining term which approximates the expected life of the options assumed at the date of grant.

These shares are included in cancelled/expired categories in the tables above. 17. Employee Benefit Plan The Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all full-time employees. The Company matches 25% of each participating employees elective deferral amount. The Companys expense related to this matching contribution totaled approximately $223,576 and $247,229 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, the Company has the option of making an annual discretionary profit-sharing contribution. No profit-sharing contribution was declared for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. 18. Related Party Transactions In accordance with a management services agreement dated November 23, 2010, the Company pays $600,000 annually to Robert D. Walter Company, an affiliate of the Company, for corporate support functions. On August 26, 2013, the agreement was amended to bear interest at 13% for unpaid balances. Management fee expense totaled $600,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, and is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. During a portion of 2013, management fees under the management services agreement were accrued and not paid current. These amounts are included in accrued liabilities (see Note 8) and amounted to $154,928 and $0 as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Credit Agreement Amendment (see Note 19) allows for the current payment of these management fees during fiscal year 2014. The Company has various building leases with two separate related parties. The terms of these lease agreement range from four to ten years from the rent commencement dates with varying renewal options. F-99 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2013 and 2012 19. Subsequent Events On January 28, 2014 the Company amended the term and revolving debt credit agreement (the Credit Agreement Amendment). The major amended terms of the Credit Agreement Amendment are as follows:  A revolving credit commitment including outstanding letters of credit up to the lesser of $60,000,000 or an agreed-upon percentage of the Companys accounts receivable and inventory. A portion of the revolving credit facility was used to repay in full the Companys term loan.  The maturity date is June 30, 2015.  Interest is payable monthly based on the 30 day LIBOR plus a margin that fluctuates between 2.50% and 3.50% based on the Companys leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement Amendment.  A commitment fee of 0.25% per annum on the unused portion of the revolving commitment.  Certain financial covenants are provided for, including a maximum senior funded debt to EBITDA ratio, and a minimum ratio of EBITDA to debt service costs and other fixed charges. In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement Amendment, existing shareholders of the Company invested $12,500,000 of equity into the Company (see Note 14). In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement Amendment, the Company also amended the subordinated loan credit agreement (the Subordinated Credit Amendment). The Subordinated Credit Amendment was amended to provide for financial covenants and other terms consistent with the Credit Agreement Amendment. In connection with entering into the Subordinated Credit Amendment, existing shareholders provided subordinated loans to the Company in the net amount of $7,500,000. These loans bear interest for the first 18 months at 14.5%, all of which is paid-in-kind and added to the principal balance. Thereafter, these loans bear interest at 13.5%, of which 12.0% is payable in cash quarterly and the remaining 1.5% will be paid-in-kind and added to the principal balance. These loans are due November 30, 2017. On February 17, 2014, American Tire Distributors, Inc. entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with the Company. The consummation of the Acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions is expected to occur by the end of first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2014. The Stock Purchase Agreement provides for the payment of aggregate cash consideration of $345,000,000 subject to certain customary pre-closing requirements, plus up to $20,000,000 in additional consideration contingent upon the occurrence of certain post-closing events. The closing purchase price is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including, but not limited to, working capital adjustments. The Company has considered subsequent events through February 28, 2014, the date on which the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued.

Managements Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Companys preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TTT Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP Columbus, Ohio April 30, 2013, except for Note 14, as to which the date is June 16, 2014 F-102 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Balance Sheets December 31, 2012 and 2011 2012 2011 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,704,505 $ 7,535,815 Accounts receivable 65,949,428 67,580,592 Other receivables 19,021,928 18,752,064 Inventories 105,494,221 97,122,446 Prepaid expenses and other 2,355,902 5,360,165 Total current assets 195,525,984 196,351,082 Notes receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $269,420 and $273,750, respectively 130,795 224,490 Property and equipment, net 7,074,576 5,209,083 Intangible assets, net 97,087,731 106,564,611 Goodwill 44,395,930 44,140,645 Other noncurrent assets 1,291,987 1,341,741 Total assets $ 345,507,003 $ 353,831,652 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Current liabilities Account payable $ 159,766,404 $ 152,797,085 Accrued liabilities 5,827,556 5,201,654 Fair value of interest rate swap 1,341,780 1,566,305 Current maturities of long-term debt 7,676,809 6,765,533 Total current liabilities 174,612,549 166,330,577 Long-term debt 83,192,672 96,868,863 Total liabilities 257,805,221 263,199,440 Commitments and contingencies Mezzanine equity Redeemable common stock; $.001 par value: 8,326 shares issued and outstanding 14,212,482 11,406,620 Stockholders equity Common stock, $.001 par value per share; 150,000 voting and 15,000 nonvoting shares authorized, 71,569 voting shares issued and outstanding 72 72 Additional paid-in capital 74,651,789 79,591,310 Note receivable from stockholder (775,166 ) (763,199 ) Accumulated earnings (387,345 )  Noncontrolling interest  397,409 Total stockholders equity 73,489,300 79,225,592 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 345,507,003 $ 353,831,652 The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements F-103 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Statement of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 2012 2011 Net sales $ 570,042,650 $ 356,292,982 Cost of goods sold 481,747,063 301,404,493 Gross profit 88,295,587 54,888,489 Operating expenses 79,195,149 46,868,511 Operating income 9,100,438 8,019,978 Interest expense, net 9,202,654 4,882,576 Income (loss) before income taxes (102,216 ) 3,137,402 Income tax expense 182,357 141,469 Net income (loss) from continuing operations (284,573 ) 2,995,933 Income from discontinued operations  1,899,118 Net income (loss) (284,573 ) 4,895,051 Net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest 102,822 294,925 Net income (loss) attributable to TTT Holdings, Inc. stockholders $ (387,395 ) $ 4,600,126 Amounts attributable to TTT Holdings, Inc. stockholders Income (loss) from continuing operations $ (387,395 ) $ 2,701,008 Income from discontinued operations  1,899,118 Net income (loss) $ (387,395 ) $ 4,600,126 The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements F-104 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Statement of Stockholders Equity and Mezzanine Equity Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 TTT Holdings, Inc.

Description of Business TTT Holdings, Inc. (Holdings) is incorporated in Delaware as an S-Corporation. Terrys Tire Town Holdings, Inc. (TTT), its wholly owned subsidiary, is incorporated in Ohio as an S-corporation. Through its operating subsidiaries, TTTs primary operations are as a wholesale distributor of tires and accessories throughout the eastern half of the United States. During 2011, TTT formed Summit Tire Northeast, LLC (Summit) to acquire the assets of Summit Tire of Massachusetts, Inc., a wholesale tire distributor with operations focused in the New England area and TTT directly acquired the stock of Englewood Tire Wholesale, Inc. (Englewood), a wholesale tire distributor with operations focused primarily in the Greater New York, New Jersey and Connecticut area (See Note 3). TTT sold its retail division during 2011 to another automotive retail company (See Note 17). Holdings has no significant assets or operations other than its ownership of TTT. The operations of TTT constitutes the operations of Holdings. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Holdings, TTT and each of TTTs wholly owned subsidiaries and entities controlled by TTT but not wholly-owned (collectively the Company). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of equity the Company does not own in the controlled entities included in the financial statements. The Company identifies its noncontrolling interests separately within the equity section on the consolidated balance sheet. The amounts of consolidated net earnings attributable to the Company and to the noncontrolling interests are presented separately on the Companys consolidated statement of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates include the Companys valuation of doubtful accounts receivable, valuation of inventory reserves, valuation of goodwill, share-based compensation, the fair value of derivative instruments, the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities, including intangible assets and related useful lives assigned to such assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties to be cash and cash equivalents. Such investments are carried at their cost, which approximates their estimated fair market value. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The majority of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were deposited with large banking institutions. The Company maintains cash deposits in banks which, from time to time, exceed the amount of deposit insurance available. Management periodically assesses the financial condition of the institutions and believes that any potential credit loss is minimal. F-107 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 and 2011 Accounts Receivable Trade receivables represent amounts due from product sales in the ordinary course of business. Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of customers financial condition, and trade receivables are generally not collateralized. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable losses for uncollected receivables. The Company determines the allowance based on customer risk, the length of time accounts are past due, and historical write-off experience. Account balances are charged to the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The total adjustment to reduce accounts receivable to the recoverable amount was $2,885,703 and $3,496,273 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Inventories Inventories consist of products held for resale and are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined by the last-in, first-out method (LIFO) for tire inventory and at moving average cost for non-tire inventory. The LIFO reserve was $4,576,974 and $3,315,201 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The composition of inventory valued at LIFO and FIFO is as follows: 2012 2011 Inventory at LIFO (primarily tire inventory) $ 101,192,482 $ 93,413,218 Inventory at FIFO (primarily non-tire inventory) 4,301,739 3,709,228 $ 105,494,221 $ 97,122,446 The above balances are presented net for slow-moving and obsolete inventory of $1,101,894 and $887,022 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Derivative Instruments The Companys interest rate risk management strategy uses derivative instruments to minimize cash flow risks caused by interest rate volatility associated with the Companys variable rate debt. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the derivative instruments used to meet the Companys risk management objectives were interest rate swaps. The Company chose not to apply hedge accounting for its interest rate swap agreements. Accordingly, the interest rate swaps are carried at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet, with changes in their fair value recognized in current earnings (See Note 11). Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs are included in other noncurrent assets and represent the direct costs of establishing the Companys term and revolving debt. Deferred financing costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method for term commitments and the straight-line method for revolving commitments. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. The cost and accumulated F-108 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 and 2011 depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated from the accounts and resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the asset. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Leasehold improvements 5  25 years Machinery and equipment 7 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Vehicles 5 years Computer software and equipment 3 years Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of customer relationships and trade names. The intangible assets were determined to have finite lives. Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is recorded to reflect the pattern of economic benefits based on projected revenues over their respective estimated useful lives. Intangible assets are amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives (customer relationships11 to 13 years and trade names3 to 18 years). Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company assesses the recoverability of property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable from its future undiscounted cash flows. If it is determined an impairment has occurred, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. No impairments were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment and between annual tests, if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment exists, using a fair value-based approach. Any such impairment is recognized in the period identified. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company identifies goodwill related to each of its reporting units. The Company has determined it operates in two reporting units: wholesale and commercial. For purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment, assets and liabilities, including goodwill, were allocated to each reporting unit on the basis of relative fair value of each unit. No impairment of goodwill was recorded in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when products are shipped or when title transfers to customers, if later, net of estimated returns and customer discounts. Supplier Incentives The Company receives monthly, quarterly and annual performance rebates from suppliers based on attaining certain purchase and/or sales goals. The Company receives other rebates from suppliers which are negotiated with suppliers and are not dependent on the Company meeting minimum purchase and/or sales goals. Suppliers rebates are recognized ratably based on the terms of the contracts or programs with each supplier and F-109 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 and 2011 are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold. Supplier rebates are classified as a reduction of inventory when the incentive is part of buying arrangement. Receivables from suppliers for rebates and incentives are included in other receivables in the consolidated balance sheet. Shipping and Handling Costs The Company includes in cost of goods sold the cost of tire and non-tire inventory sold. Warehousing and distribution costs, including costs associated with delivering product to customers are included in operating expenses. Total warehousing and distribution costs for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were approximately $37,992,000 and $18,170,000, respectively including approximately $14,842,000 and $8,298,000, respectively, related to shipping and handling. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed when incurred as part of operating expenses. The Company receives reimbursements from vendors for advertising costs. Reimbursements for advertising expenditures are reported on a net basis within operating expenses. Reimbursements received in excess of the cost of advertising are reported within cost of goods sold. Net advertising costs were $180,924 and $243,436 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for equity awards provided to employees in return for employee service. The Company issued both time vesting and performance-based stock options to certain employees. Time vesting options are measured at the fair value of the award at the grant date and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period. The performance-based options vest in tranches based on the Company meeting annual earnings targets and also contain a service requirement. Compensation expense for performance-based options is recorded over the relevant service period when it becomes probable that the contingent performance measures are expected to be met. Fair value is measured at the grant date and amortized on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Income Taxes There is no provision for federal and certain state income taxes in the consolidated financial statements of the Company, as an S-corporation is generally not subject to these taxes. Stockholders are individually subject to the income taxes on the Companys results of operations and, accordingly, the Company pays distributions to the members to the extent needed to fund the stockholders tax obligations. Certain state and local jurisdictions do not recognize the flow-through status of an S-corporation and require minimum income tax expense. Accordingly, the Company has recognized a state and local income tax in the accompanying statement of operations for these jurisdictions. 3. Business Acquisitions Summit Tire Northeast, LLC On February 28, 2011, the Company, through its newly formed subsidiary Summit Tire Northeast, LLC, acquired substantially all of the assets of Summit Tire of Massachusetts, Inc. Summit is in the business of wholesale distribution of tires and tire accessories throughout the New England area. The intent of the acquisition was to expand into a new geographic market consistent with the Companys long-term growth strategy. F-110 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 and 2011 The purchase price was $16,202,421 paid in cash. The purchase was accounted for on the acquisition method and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill of $2,984,208 was recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Transaction costs of $279,317 were expensed in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. The purchase price was allocated as follows: Assets Accounts receivable $ 5,071,731 Other receivables 361,722 Inventories 7,895,119 Property and equipment 613,997 Intangible assets 9,350,000 Goodwill 2,984,208 Other assets 198,176 Total assets acquired 26,474,953 Total liabilities assumed (10,272,532 ) Fair value of net assets acquired $ 16,202,421 Englewood Tire Wholesale, Inc. On November 30, 2011, the Company acquired 100% of the stock of Englewood Tire Wholesale, Inc. Englewood was in the business of wholesale distribution of tires and tire accessories throughout the Greater New York, New Jersey and Connecticut areas.

The purchase price was $80,045,976, comprised of $7,500,000 in common shares of TTT Holdings, Inc. and $72,545,976 in cash. The Company paid $76,620,986 in 2011 but then received $4,075,010 from the seller in March 2012 as a final purchase price adjustment. The purchase was accounted for on the acquisition method and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill of $25,695,425 was recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Transaction costs of $923,355 were expensed in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. F-111 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 and 2011 The purchase price was allocated as follows: Assets Cash $ 950,868 Accounts receivable 28,235,551 Other receivables 5,443,752 Inventories 26,321,184 Property and equipment 844,652 Intangible assets 48,900,000 Goodwill 25,695,425 Other assets 294,529 Total assets acquired 136,685,961 Total liabilities assumed (56,639,985 ) Fair value of net assets acquired $ 80,045,976 The purchase price allocation has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect information identified during the measurement period relating to facts and circumstances present at the acquisition date. Accounts receivable was decreased by $1,422,307 to reflect additional uncollectible accounts, inventory was decreased by $262,218 to reflect additional slow-moving items and liabilities were increased $113,411 to reflect cash discounts against payables previously estimated. These adjustments resulted in additional goodwill of $1,797,936. Kramer Tire On May 13, 2012, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets associated with the wholesale distribution operations of two facilities located in Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia, from Monro Muffler Brake, Inc. The intent of the acquisition was to increase operations in the Mid-Atlantic market and reinforce relationships with Monro Muffler Brake, Inc. The purchase price was $2,267,338 paid in cash. The purchase was accounted for on the acquisition method and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill of $255,285 was recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Transaction costs of $114,000 were expensed in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012. The purchase price was allocated as follows: Assets Inventories $ 1,433,277 Intangible assets 656,088 Goodwill 255,285 Other assets 12,480 Total assets acquired 2,357,130 Total liabilities assumed (89,792 ) Fair value of net assets acquired $ 2,267,338 The estimated fair value of net assets acquired, including the allocation of the fair value to identifiable assets and liabilities, was determined using Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy (See Fair Value F-112 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 and 2011 Measurements in Note 12). The estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets, consisting of customer relationships for Summit, Englewood and Kramer, and the Summit and Englewood trade names were determined using an income approach based on excess cash flow, relief of royalty and discounted cash flow methods. The discounted cash flow valuation method requires the use of assumptions, the most significant of which include: future revenue growth, future earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, estimated synergies to be achieved by a market participant as a result of the business combination, marginal tax rate, terminal value growth rate, weighted average cost of capital and discount rate. The excess earnings method used to value customer relationships requires the use of assumptions the most significant of which include: the remaining useful life, expected revenue, survivor curve, earnings before interest and tax margins, marginal tax rate, contributory asset charges, discount rate and tax amortization benefit. The most significant assumptions under the relief of royalty method include: estimated remaining useful life, expected revenue, royalty rate, tax rate, discount rate and tax amortization benefit. Management, with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist, has developed these assumptions on the basis of knowledge of the business and projected financial information of Summit, Englewood and Kramer. These assumptions may vary based on future events, perceptions of different market participants and other factors outside the control of management, and such variations may be significant to estimated values. 4.

The Agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the Companys assets. The revolving commitment including outstanding letters of credit is available up to the lesser of $45,000,000 or an agreed-upon percentage of the Companys accounts receivable and inventory and has a maturity date of November 30, 2016. The Company is required to pay commitment fees up to 0.375% per annum on the unused portion of the revolving commitment. The total term loan commitment is $45,000,000 and requires monthly principal payments of $535,714 through November 30, 2016. The remaining outstanding principal is due on November 30, 2016. The Agreement also contains provisions which, under certain circumstances, require the Company to make prepayments of the term loan commitment beginning in 2012, based on excess cash flows as defined in the Agreement. Interest on the revolving loan and term loan is payable monthly based on 30 day LIBOR plus a margin that fluctuates between 2.25% and 3.50% based on the Companys leverage ratio, as defined in the Agreement. At December 31, 2012, the margin was 2.75% with a total rate of 2.96%. At December 31, 2011, the margin was 2.75% with a total rate of 3.05%. Subordinated Loan On November 30, 2011, the Company entered into a subordinated credit agreement (the Subordinated Loan) with a lender. The Subordinated Loan consists of term debt which is due in full on November 30, 2017. This term debt was issued at an original issue discount of $765,306. The Company amortizes the original issue discount over the life of the loan commitment using the effective interest method. The Subordinated Loan also contains provisions which, under certain circumstances, require the Company to make prepayments of the loan commitment beginning in 2013, based on excess cash flows as defined in the Subordinated Loan. The Subordinated Loan is unsecured and bears interest at 13.5%, of which at least 12% shall be payable in cash F-116 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 and 2011 quarterly, through maturity. The remaining 1.5% may be paid in kind and added to the principal balance, at the Companys option. The Subordinated Loan allows for optional prepayments at redemption prices ranging from 100% to 103%, based on the date of the redemption. The Subordinated Loan also allowed for a delayed draw term commitment of up to $28,061,224. The Company did not make any borrowings under the delayed draw term commitment which expired on November 30, 2012. The Agreement and the Subordinated Loan contain certain restrictive financial covenants, which specify minimum net worth requirements, maximum liabilities to earnings before income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) ratio and a minimum ratio of EBITDA to debt service cost, among others. The Company is also required to meet certain non-financial covenants, which include restrictions on indebtedness, liens and dividends. Seller Note The Company has a credit agreement with a former shareholder of the predecessor Company (the Seller Note) that matures on May 31, 2018. No principal payments are required to be made until the maturity date. The Seller Note bears interest at an annual rate of 13%, of which at least 10% is payable in cash on a quarterly basis, through maturity. The remaining 3% is considered paid-in-kind interest and is added to the principal balance. The seller note is subordinate to the Companys other financing arrangements. Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt are as follows: 2013 $ 7,676,809 2014 6,428,568 2015 6,428,568 2016 21,598,316 2017 38,703,833 Thereafter 10,632,877 $ 91,468,971 10. Commitments and Contingencies Leases The Company leases certain warehouse facilities, office facilities and vehicles under operating leases expiring at various dates through November 2020. The leases require the Company to pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other operating expenses applicable to the leased facilities. The terms of certain warehouse and office facility leases call for minimum rents to increase each year. Accordingly, the Company has accounted for the rent expense under the straight-line method. F-117 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 and 2011 At December 31, 2012, future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows: Related Parties Third Parties Total 2013 $ 2,234,788 $ 7,907,068 $ 10,141,856 2014 2,113,788 6,624,546 8,738,334 2015 2,002,124 5,540,082 7,542,206 2016 773,820 3,699,037 4,472,857 2017 773,820 5,260,608 6,034,428 Thereafter 2,256,975 12,761,306 15,018,281 $ 10,155,315 $ 41,792,647 $ 51,947,962 Total rent expense charged to operations, including $2,245,788 and $1,416,984 to related parties, was $9,857,191 and $5,389,072 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Legal Contingent liabilities arise in the ordinary course of the Companys activities. Various legal actions, proceedings and claims may be instituted or asserted in the future against the Company. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal proceedings and claims could be decided unfavorably to the Company. Based on information presently known, management does not believe any claims will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operation. 11. Derivative Instruments The Company has two separate interest rate swap agreements with a lender for the purpose of reducing certain exposures to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate term debt. The notional amount of each of the swaps is $25,000,000. In accordance with the swap agreements, the Company pays a fixed rate of interest of 2.10% and 2.12% plus the applicable spread, and receives a floating rate of the lenders LIBOR rate plus the applicable spread. One of the swap agreements expires in November 2015 and the other swap agreement expires in January 2016. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was ($1,341,780) and ($1,566,305). The resulting loss in their fair value from December 31, 2010 was included as an increase in interest expense, net and was $(224,525) and $825,076 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 12. Fair Value Measurements The Company measures or monitors certain assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is used on a recurring basis for assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting, mainly derivative instruments. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principle or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The Company applies the fair value hierarchy, and when possible looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets and liabilities. If identical assets and liabilities are F-118 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 and 2011 not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 3 Unobservable inputs based on the Companys own assumptions. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the Companys financial instruments as of December 31, 2012: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Liabilities Derivative instruments $  $ 1,341,780 $  $ 1,341,780 Long-term debt   90,869,481 90,869,481 The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the Companys financial instruments as of December 31, 2011: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Liabilities Derivative instruments $  $ 1,566,305 $  $ 1,566,305 Long-term debt   103,634,396 103,634,396 The fair value of the Companys interest rate swaps are estimated using discounted cash flows that use market observable inputs of forward interest rate yield curves and a Company-specific risk adjusted discount rate. The fair value of long-term debt reflects the present value of future cash outflows relating to the obligation based on estimated credit market interest premiums and expected future interest rates. The carrying amounts reported on the consolidated balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, other receivables, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments. 13. Stockholders Equity On November 23, 2010, the Company issued 56,179 shares of common stock under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement. A total of 85,000 shares were originally authorized at November 23, 2010. On November 30, 2011, an additional 23,716 shares were issued in conjunction with the stock acquisition of Englewood. The total number of authorized shares was increased to 150,000 shares. Common shares are entitled to one vote per share and are entitled to vote on all matters upon which stockholders have the right to vote under law or the Companys Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement (the Stockholders Agreement) which was amended on November 30, 2011. The Stockholders Agreement also provides for annual tax distributions on the taxable income allocated to each stockholder. The Company is authorized to issue 15,000 non-voting shares, none of which are outstanding at December 31, 2012 or 2011. F-119 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 and 2011 14. Mezzanine Equity Two stockholders have the right to require the Company to purchase up to approximately half of their respective common shares at a future date (the Put Options). The Put Options are exercisable at the option of the holder for a 90 day window beginning on November 23, 2015 and November 23, 2018 for one of the stockholders and November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2019 for the second stockholder. If the Put Options are exercised, the Company would purchase the put common shares at a price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the put option exercise date. As the Put Options are a redemption right which is outside the Companys control, under Regulation S-X, the Company should have classified this redeemable common stock in the mezzanine equity section in the accompanying Balance Sheets at its redemption value, which is equal to fair value, and recorded changes in fair value to Additional paid-in capital since the Company has an accumulated deficit. The financial statements previously presented the redeemable common stock within Stockholders Equity. The 2012 and 2011 Balance Sheets and Statement of Stockholders Equity have been revised to correct the misstatement in presentation of the redeemable common stock as Mezzanine Equity. The impact of this revision is as follows and was not material to the current or prior year financial statements. Total stockholders equity at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was reduced by $14,212,482, $11,406,620, and $5,589,500, respectively primarily reflecting a reduction in Additional paid-in capital, and Mezzanine Equity was increased at December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 by the same amounts. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock were decreased and proceeds from the issuance of redeemable stock were increased by $3,749,005 within the presentation of cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011. There was no effect on the statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 or 2011 and no effect on the statement of cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2012. 15. Stock Based Compensation In November 2010, the Board of Directors approved the TTT Holdings Equity Incentive Plan (Equity Incentive Plan). In November 2011, the Board of Directors increased the number of nonvoting common shares authorized for issuance under the Equity Incentive Plan to 8,000. As of December 31, 2012, the Equity Incentive Plan had 1,647 nonvoting common shares available for granting in the form of stock options. The Equity Incentive Plan permits the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock or stock options, as determined by the Companys Board of Directors. To date, the Company has stock options which expire no later than ten years from the date of grant and will become exercisable as directed by the Board of Directors. The time vesting stock options generally vest in equal annual installments over a three-year period, while the performance based stock options vest in tranches based on the Company meeting annual earnings targets and also contain a service requirement. Stock-based compensation expense was $418,006 and $703,712 during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which was recorded in operating expenses in the statement of operations. Of the total stock-based compensation expense recognized, $0 and $327,950 related to performance-based options during the years ending December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense is based on the grant-date fair value. The fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of comparable public companies for a period equal to the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury interest rates with a remaining term which approximates the expected life of the options assumed at the date of grant. F-120 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 and 2011 The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for options granted during 2012 are as follows: Expected volatility 46.22 % Expected term (years) 6.36 Risk free interest rate 1.80 % Expected dividend yield 0.00 % The weighted average grant date fair value of options is as follows: Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Nonvested at December 31, 2010 4,352 $ 452 Granted 401 652 Vested 1,451 452 Forfeited   Nonvested at December 31, 2011 3,302 473 Granted 1,600 486 Vested 792 457 Forfeited 792 467 Nonvested at December 31, 2012 3,318 $ 482 A summary of option activity as of December 31, 2012 and changes during the period is presented below: Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Outstanding at December 31, 2010 4,352 $ 1,000 Granted 401 $ 1,370 Exercised  Cancelled/Expired  Outstanding at December 31, 2011 4,753 $ 1,031 9.00 Granted 1,600 $ 2,000 Exercised  Cancelled/Expired  Outstanding at December 31, 2012 6,353 $ 1,275 8.31 Vested and unvested expected to vest at December 31, 2012 5,561 $ 1,310 8.36 Exercisable at December 31, 2012 2,243 $ 1,011 7.94 There was $1,599,276 and $1,515,325 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2016. 16. Employee Benefit Plan The Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all full-time employees. The Company matches 25% of each participating employees elective deferral amount. The Companys expense F-121 TTT Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 and 2011 related to this matching contribution totaled approximately $247,229 and $140,873 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Subsequent Events In March 2013, the Company amended the term and revolving debt credit agreement and the subordinated loan credit agreement. These amendments modify the minimum net worth requirements, maximum liabilities to EBITDA ratio and the minimum ratio of EBITDA to debt service cost covenants and are now less restrictive. The Company has considered subsequent events through April 30, 2013, the date on which the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued.

Managements Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entitys preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company and Subsidiaries as of October 31, 2013 and 2012 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. /s/ Plante & Moran, PLLC Toledo, OH December 19, 2013 F-124 The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company and Subsidiaries Consolidated Balance Sheet October 31, 2013 October 31, 2012 Assets Current Assets Cash $ 5,831,219 $ 7,813,040 Accounts receivableNet (Note 1) 95,475,412 90,929,981 InventoryFinished goods (Note 1) 135,268,064 134,767,138 Prepaid expenses and other current assets: Prepaid expenses and deposits 4,193,836 2,681,764 Refundable taxes 258,001 1,166,050 Deferred tax assets (Note 7) 4,054,000 3,867,000 Total current assets 245,080,532 241,224,973 Property and Equipment Net (Note 2) 24,969,328 25,178,057 Goodwill (Note 15) 703,529 650,701 Intangible Assets Net (Note 3) 6,324,008 6,799,004 Other Assets Other noncurrent assets 3,791,691 4,816,677 Total assets $ 280,869,088 $ 278,669,412 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Current Liabilities Trade accounts payable $ 96,582,099 $ 94,606,284 Accounts payable settlement arrangements (Note 4) 5,657,190 8,372,049 Bank line of credit (Note 5) 97,379,524 93,800,000 Current portion of long-term debt (Note 6) 4,570,000 4,738,284 Accrued and other current liabilities: Taxes payable 89,000 2,482,000 Accrued compensation 2,438,449 2,549,105 Other accrued liabilities 13,931,772 12,117,846 Total current liabilities 220,648,034 218,665,568 Long-term Debt Net of current portion (Note 6) 8,615,000 13,185,000 Other Long-term Liabilities Deferred tax liabilities (Note 7) 4,761,000 6,239,000 Stockholders Equity 46,845,054 40,579,844 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 280,869,088 $ 278,669,412 See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

F-128 The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2013 and 2012 Note 1Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company and Subsidiaries (the Company) is a leading marketer of replacement tires in the U.S., Canada, and globally. The Company offers an extensive selection of passenger, ultra-high performance, light truck, medium truck, trailer, off-the-road, industrial, and specialty tires manufactured by its worldwide supplier network. In addition to its Hercules flag brand, the Company also markets the controlled brands of Ironman and Avalanche. The Company is also a major distributor of many select manufacturer brands throughout the Companys global distribution network. The Company is headquartered in Findlay, Ohio and operates 21 regional wholesale distribution operations throughout North America. Current locations reside in Arizona, California, Colorado, Ohio, Texas, Illinois, Florida, Oregon, Washington, Ontario (Canada), British Columbia (Canada), Montreal (Canada), and New Brunswick (Canada) using the names TDW (Tire Dealers Warehouse) or Hercules Tire Canada. The Company operates on an international basis in the U.S., Canada, and China under the name Hercules Tire International. The international organizations presence includes warehouse operations in Qingdao (China), Ontario (Canada), Ohio, and Florida with representative offices in Guangzhou (China), Ontario (Canada), and Florida. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Hercules Tire Company of Canada, Inc. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Receivables In the course of extending credit to its customers, the Company occasionally requires notes receivable or security interests in inventory and other property, mortgages, personal guarantees, and other collateral. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Companys previous loss history, and the customers current obligation to pay the Company. The Company writes off accounts receivable against the allowance when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received are credited to bad debt recoveries. The Companys allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $1,561,000 and $1,540,000 as of October 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of the Companys products is recognized once the risk and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customers, which, in most cases, coincide with shipment of the products. For other cases involving export sales, the title transfers when the products are delivered to the port of embarkation or when they are received at the port of the country of destination. Late payment charges are assessed for invoices not paid by the due date. Such charges are recognized in income when collected. Cash discounts are treated as a reduction to sales and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates. Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory includes product, duty, freight, and other direct costs. F-129 The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2013 and 2012 Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided over the estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 40 years, of the various classes of assets using the straight-line method. Costs of maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred. Goodwill The recorded amounts of goodwill from prior business combinations are based on managements best estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is assessed at least on an annual basis for impairment. Impairment of Long-lived Assets When indicators of impairment are present, management evaluates the net carrying value of long-lived assets by considering estimated future cash flows from both use and disposal of the assets. No impairment charges were recognized in 2013 and 2012. Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of trademarks, are carried at historical cost and are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually as of October 31, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. The impairment analysis compares the estimated fair value of these assets to the related carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded for any excess of carrying value over estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is based upon projected cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risks involved. Acquired intangible assets subject to amortization are stated at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Deferred Finance Charges Deferred finance charges represent legal, consulting, and financial costs associated with debt financing (see Note 5) and are reported net of accumulated amortization, resulting in balances of approximately $480,000 and $1,318,000 at October 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Such charges are being amortized over the respective terms of the debt agreements. Amortization costs totaling approximately $833,000 and $775,000 for the years ended October 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to deferred finance charges are included in general and administrative expenses. Stock-based Compensation The Company has adopted the fair value method of recording stock-based employee compensation as contained in accounting standards. As a result of adopting the fair value method, stock options and the incentive plan are expensed over the vesting period of the options/plan. Income Taxes A current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the year. Deferred tax liabilities or assets are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax accounting. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of the Companys Canadian wholesale distribution division, Hercules Tire Company of Canada, Inc., are translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the close of the period. Income and expenses are translated at an average rate of exchange for the period. The aggregate effect of translating the consolidated financial statements is included in other comprehensive income. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains, and losses be included in net income. Certain changes in assets and liabilities, however, such as foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on certain derivative instruments, are reported as a direct adjustment to the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. Such items, along with net income, are considered components of comprehensive income (loss). F-130 The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2013 and 2012 Included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at October 31, 2013 and 2012 was approximately ($380,000) and ($742,000), respectively, related to the foreign currency translation adjustment. There was no interest rate swap cash flow hedge at October 31, 2013 and there was approximately ($169,000) related to the interest rate swap cash flow hedge at October 31, 2012. The cash flow hedge recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) was $171,372 and $169,125, respectively, net of tax expense of $100,647 and $99,331, respectively, during the years ended October 31, 2013 and 2012. During fiscal year 2013, the Company adopted new guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income in the financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance eliminated the prior option to only present comprehensive income in the statement of equity. The Company has elected to report comprehensive income in a single statement of operations and comprehensive income. The change in presentation has been applied retrospectively and the October 31, 2012 financial statements have been restated to conform to the new presentation method. Other than the change in presentation of comprehensive income and related disclosures, the new guidance did not have a material effect on the financial statements. Shipping and Handling Costs The Company records shipping and handling costs for the delivery of finished goods in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. Total shipping and handling costs for the years ended October 31, 2013 and 2012 were approximately $26,906,000 and $27,141,000, respectively. Major Suppliers During the year ended October 31, 2013, the Companys three largest suppliers accounted for 22 percent, 21 percent, and 9 percent, respectively, of the Companys tire purchases. During the year ended October 31, 2012, the Companys three largest suppliers accounted for 25 percent, 19 percent, and 7 percent, respectively, of the Companys tire purchases. Subsequent Events The consolidated financial statements and related disclosures include evaluation of events up through and including December 19, 2013, which is the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of the Companys accounts receivable, accounts payable, line of credit, and bank note payable approximate their fair value due to either the short maturity of such instruments or the existence of variable interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates. The fair value of the interest rate swap generally reflects the estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contract at the reporting date. Reclassification Certain 2012 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentation. F-131 The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2013 and 2012 Note 2Property and Equipment Property and equipment are summarized as follows: 2013 2012 Land $ 1,630,642 $ 1,630,642 Buildings and fixtures 15,640,587 14,385,537 Machinery and equipment 7,533,901 7,018,988 Tire molds 25,019,437 22,377,127 Computer equipment and software 4,982,509 4,635,445 Leasehold improvements 2,186,096 1,844,766 Construction in progress 95,530 604,257 Total cost 57,088,702 52,496,762 Accumulated depreciation 32,119,374 27,318,705 Net property and equipment $ 24,969,328 $ 25,178,057 Depreciation expense was approximately $5,327,000 in 2013 and $4,845,000 in 2012.

The customer relationships asset is being amortized over a period of nine years and estimated amortization expense for the next three years ending October 31 is as follows: 2014 $ 318,000 2015 200,000 2016 106,008 Total $ 624,008 The Company evaluates its trademarks for impairment at least annually. No impairment charges were recognized in 2013 and 2012. F-132 The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2013 and 2012 Note 4Accounts Payable Settlement Arrangements At October 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had accounts payable settlement arrangements with a certain vendor and third-party intermediary of approximately $5,657,000 and $8,372,000, respectively. This arrangement provides that, at the vendors request, the third-party intermediary advances the amount of the scheduled payment to the vendor, less an appropropriate discount, before the scheduled payment date and the Company makes their payment to the third-party intermediary on the date stipulated with interest at LIBOR plus 3 percent in accordance with the commercial terms negotiated with its vendor. The Company records interest related to these arrangements as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. Note 5Line of Credit The Company has a revolving line of credit expiring in October 2015 that provides for total borrowing capacity of $142 million at October 31, 2013 and 2012. Aggregate outstanding borrowings are limited to a percentage of U.S. and Canadian trade accounts receivable and inventory. Outstanding Canadian and U.S. borrowings are limited to $25 million and $117 million, respectively in both 2013 and 2012. Borrowings accrue interest based on the prime rate, bankers acceptance rate, or eurodollar rate, plus a rate spread, which is dependent on the Companys leverage ratio as defined in the agreement. A commitment fee on the Companys total unused borrowing capacity is paid quarterly. Unused availability, net of outstanding letters of credit, aggregated approximately $42,775,000 at October 31, 2013 and $46,355,000 at October 31, 2012. Both the line of credit and the term loan described in Note 6 are collateralized by substantially all of the Companys assets. Note 6Long-term Debt Long-term debt at October 31 is as follows: 2013 2012 Bank term debt payable in quarterly installments of amounts ranging from $550,000 to $910,000 plus a payment of $1,430,000 due at maturity including interest based upon the prime rate or eurodollar rate plus rate spread, expires October 2015, collateralized by substantially all of the Companys assets $ 7,800,000 $ 11,440,000 Unsecured debt to former stockholders, various rates based on applicable adjusted federal long-term rates as published by the Internal Revenue Service at time of debt issuance and 5 percent at October 31, 2012.  238,284 Bonds payable for Findlay Distribution Center in monthly installments ranging between $108,000 and $112,000 including interest of 7.63 percent and 7.25 percent until maturity in October 2018 and collateralized by the facility and letter of credit reserves of $500,000 and $835,000 5,385,000 6,245,000 Total 13,185,000 17,923,284 Less current portion 4,570,000 4,738,284 Long-term portion $ 8,615,000 $ 13,185,000 F-133 The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2013 and 2012 The balance of the above debt matures as follows: 2014 $ 4,570,000 2015 5,155,000 2016 1,070,000 2017 1,155,000 2018 1,235,000 Total $ 13,185,000 Interest expense for the years ended October 31, 2013 and 2012 was approximately $6,700,000 and $6,597,000, respectively. Under the agreements with the bank for both the term loan and line of credit described in Note 5, the Company is subject to various financial covenants, including fixed charge coverage, consolidated capital funds test, and minimum EBITDA test. The Company follows current guidance relating to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, which requires that all derivative instruments be reported on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as either assets or liabilities and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes. In June 2010, the Company entered into an interest rate swap that fixed the rate on a notional amount of $45,000,000. The Company determined that the derivative instruments meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting. During fiscal year 2013 the interest rate swap contract expired. The fair value of the swap was approximately $268,000 of liability on October 31, 2012. The net change in fair value during fiscal year 2012 was recorded, net of income taxes, in other comprehensive income. There was no impact on net income for the year ended October 31, 2012 because the swap was an effective cash flow hedge. Note 7Income Taxes The components of the income tax provision included in the consolidated statement of operations are all attributable to continuing operations and are detailed as follows: 2013 2012 U.S. federal $ 3,624,000 $ 2,017,000 Foreign 1,071,000 807,000 State and local 179,000 584,000 Deferred income tax (recovery) expense (1,665,000 ) 623,000 Total income tax expense $ 3,209,000 $ 4,031,000 During the years ended October 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company paid taxes of approximately $5,783,000 and $4,319,000, respectively. F-134 The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2013 and 2012 The details of the net deferred tax liability are as follows: 2013 2012 Deferred tax assets: Tax operating loss carryforwards $ 166,098 $ 166,116 Allowances on inventories and receivables 2,654,492 2,339,018 Foreign tax credit  39,854 Accrued liabilities and other 2,821,788 1,601,122 Gross deferred tax assets 5,642,378 4,146,110 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment (3,481,393 ) (3,677,015 ) Intangible assets (2,391,165 ) (2,518,268 ) Other (476,820 ) (322,827 ) Gross deferred tax liabilities (6,349,378 ) (6,518,110 ) Net deferred tax liability $ (707,000 ) $ (2,372,000 ) The Company has approximately $5,537,000 of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future income taxes, expiring in 2014 through 2027. The Company is not currently under examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any state or local tax authorities. The Companys federal income tax returns for the years prior to October 31, 2010 are no longer subject to examination. The Company had an Internal Revenue Service audit through October 31, 2008. The Company also files in various states within the U.S., most notably California and Florida. The state tax returns prior to October 31, 2008 are no longer subject to examination. The Company was under audit with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) during fiscal year 2012 for the 2009 and 2010 tax years. The CRA has completed its audit and has assessed an insignificant amount of taxes owed. The Company is in the process of appealing. The additional taxes, if any, are deemed insignificant by management. Note 8Capital Stock Common stock consists of 1,500,000 authorized shares of no par value stock. As of October 31, 2013 and 2012, there were 1,034,172 shares issued and outstanding. Note 9Stock-based Compensation The Management Stock Option Plan permits the grant of share options to employees for up to 123,596 shares of common stock. Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Companys stock at the date of grant; those option awards generally vest based on four years of continuous service and have 10-year contractual terms. Certain option and share awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control (as defined in the plan). Total compensation cost that has been charged against income for those plans was approximately $150,000 and $155,000 for 2013 and 2012, respectively. F-135 The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2013 and 2012 The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a BlackScholes option valuation model that uses the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the NASDAQ transportation index. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 2013 2012 Range of expected volatility 32 % 34 % Range of expected dividends 0 % 0 % Expected term (in years) 5 5 Risk-free rate 1.01 % 0.88 % A summary of option activity under the plan for the year ended October 31, 2013 is presented below: Options Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Outstanding at November 1, 2011 104,899 $ 61.69 5.4 Granted 4,500 93.96 9.0 Outstanding at November 1, 2012 109,399 63.02 4.6 Granted 19,000 75.67 9.3 Forfeited or expired (6,750 ) 61.12 7.4 Outstanding at October 31, 2013 121,649 64.89 4.0 As of October 31, 2013, there was approximately $487,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years. As of October 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no options exercised. As of October 31, 2013, there are 76,639 options fully vested. The Company has an incentive plan that provides an incentive payment at the time of a change of control. The benefits vest over four years and were fully vested as of October 31, 2013. At October 31, 2013 and 2012, a liability of $3,200,000 and $1,300,000, respectively has been recorded based on the fair value of the incentive plan. Compensation expense of $1,900,000 and $1,300,000 has been recorded for 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to the incentive plan. Note 10Related Party Transactions Management Fees For the years ended October 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company incurred expenses and management fees payable to an affiliate of one of the stockholders of $1,000,014 and $505,897, respectively. Note 11Operating Leases The Company leases certain buildings, equipment, and land for use in operations. Rental expense under all operating leases was approximately $13,030,000 and $12,376,000 for the years ended October 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Certain leases provide for renewals at the Companys option at the end of the initial lease term. F-136 The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2013 and 2012 Future minimum annual commitments under these operating leases are as follows: Years Ending October 31 Amount 2014 $ 9,313,854 2015 8,695,265 2016 6,356,289 2017 3,532,766 2018 2,172,756 Thereafter 1,898,221 Total $ 31,969,151 Note 12Retirement Plans The Company sponsors a 401(k) plan for substantially all employees. The plan provides for the Company to make a matching contribution. Contributions to the plan approximated $939,000 and $912,000 for the years ended October 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Note 13Contingencies The Company is a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, including certain claims pertaining to product liability matters that name the Company as co-defendant along with the manufacturer. In most of these cases, the manufacturer has assumed defense of the claim on behalf of the named defendants. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of pending lawsuits and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Note 14Fair Value Measurements Accounting standards require certain assets and liabilities be reported at fair value in the consolidated financial statements and provide a framework for establishing that fair value. The framework for determining fair value is based on a hierarchy that prioritizes the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs use other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and other inputs such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs, including inputs that are available in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the related asset. These Level 3 fair value measurements are based primarily on managements own estimates using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques taking into account the characteristics of the asset. In instances whereby inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, fair value measurements in their entirety are categorized based on the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation. The Companys assessment of the significance of particular inputs to these fair value measurements requires judgment and considers factors specific to each asset or liability. F-137 The Hercules Tire & Rubber Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2013 and 2012 The Company measures interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of interest rate swaps is based primarily on Level 2 inputs as described above. Note 15Business Combination On November 9, 2011, the Company purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a Canadian tire distributor located in Ville Sainte-Catherine in the Province of Quebec (the Montreal location). The primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the Companys distribution operations by adding the Montreal location. The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Company and the Montreal location. The agreed-upon price was $3,545,614; however, subsequent to the asset purchase, final adjustments to the consideration resulted in a decrease to the purchase price of approximately $177,000. The transaction was financed through the Companys line of credit. The following table summarizes the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed translated to U.S. dollars: Accounts receivable $ 1,847,405 Inventory 3,043,422 Prepaids 28,758 Property, plant, and equipment 357,499 Other assets 289,585 Accounts payable (2,623,411 ) Accrued liabilities (168,844 ) Total identifiable net assets 2,774,414 Goodwill 636,270 Total $ 3,410,684 The difference between the goodwill amount in the schedule above and the goodwill reported on the consolidated balance sheet is due to foreign currency translation.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Regional Tire Distributors Inc. (the Company), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended January 31, 2013, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. Managements Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Companys preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Regional Tire Distributors as of January 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ending January 31, 2013 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. /s/ Deloitte LLP Chartered Professional Accountants, Chartered Accountants Licensed Public Accountants April 25, 2013 F-142 Regional Tire Distributors Inc.

F-146 Regional Tire Distributors Inc. Notes to the consolidated financial statements January 31, 2013 and 2012 (Presented in United States Dollars) 1. Nature of business Regional Tire Distributors Inc. (Company) was incorporated on July 21, 2008 under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada and commenced active operations in September of 2008. The Company, based in Burlington, Ontario, Canada, is a wholesale distributor of tires and services to retail tire locations across Canada including independent service garages, automotive car dealers and large national customers. 2. Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements are prepared in United States (US) dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). A summary of significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are outlined below. Basis of consolidation These consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Regional Tire Distributors Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiary JAB Holdings Ltd. and its majority owned subsidiary Regional Tire Distributors (Atlantic) Inc. The Company does not have any variable interests in variable interest entities. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated during consolidation. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are based on several factors including the facts and circumstances available at the time of the estimates are made, historical experience, risk of loss, general economic conditions and trends, and the assessment of the probably future outcome. Significant estimates include inventory obsolescence reserves, allowance for doubtful accounts, returns and rebates, valuation of long lived assets, purchase price allocations in business combinations and deferred taxes. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in the statement of comprehensive income in the period that they are determined. Allowance for doubtful accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the best estimate of probable loss inherent within the Companys accounts receivable balance. Estimates are based upon the creditworthiness of specific customers and past experience of write offs. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realizable value and consist primarily of automotive tires, wheels, tubes and wheel accessories. The Company performs periodic assessments to determine the existence of obsolete, slow-moving and non-saleable inventories and records necessary provisions to reduce such inventories to net realizable value. F-147 Regional Tire Distributors Inc. Notes to the consolidated financial statements January 31, 2013 and 2012 (Presented in United States Dollars) Investments in affiliates The Company holds equity investments in affiliates for which it does not have a controlling financial interest, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting wherein the Company records its proportionate share of the investees income or loss in its consolidated financial statements. Investments are evaluated for impairment when facts or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. Impairment is recognized when a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company reviews several factors to determine whether a loss is other-than-temporary. These factors include, but are not limited to, the: (1) nature of the investment; (2) cause and duration of the impairment; (3) extent to which fair value is less than cost; (4) financial conditions and near term prospects of the issuers; and (5) ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. Business combinations Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Company, liabilities incurred by the Company to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Company in exchange for control of the acquiree. At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value. The Corporation measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognized amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in profit or loss. The Company has measured the non-controlling interest at its fair value on the acquisition date. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issuance of debt or equity securities, that the Company incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Income taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC Topic 740). ASC Topic 740 requires the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The measurement of a deferred tax asset is adjusted by a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize tax benefits only to the extent that, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that they will be realized. In determining the valuation allowance, the Company considers factors by taxing jurisdiction, including estimated taxable income, history of losses for tax purposes, tax planning strategies and the likelihood of success of tax filing positions, among others. A change to any of these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense. F-148 Regional Tire Distributors Inc. Notes to the consolidated financial statements January 31, 2013 and 2012 (Presented in United States Dollars) The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon the technical merits, it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax impacts recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest impact that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes. Foreign currency The Canadian dollar is the currency in which a substantial amount of the Companys transactions are denominated and is the functional currency of the Company. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar are translated into Canadian dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in currencies other than the Canadian dollar during the year are converted into Canadian dollar at the applicable rates of exchange prevailing on the transaction date. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The Company has chosen to present its financial statements in United States Dollars. The financial statements are translated to the United States dollar presentation currency at the end of the reporting period. Assets and liabilities are translated at the January 31 rates of exchange. Income and expenses are translated at rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. The Company has used average exchange rates to approximate the rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. All exchange gains and losses are recognized as a separate component of stockholders equity. Financial instruments Financial instruments are comprised of cash, accounts receivable, due to/from related parties, note receivable, bank indebtedness, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and long-term debt. The estimated fair values of cash, accounts receivable, due to/from related parties, note receivable, bank indebtedness, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are approximate to book values because of their short-term maturities. The long-term debt approximates carrying value as it bears interests at variable rates. All financial instruments are measured at amortized cost. Interest rate risk The Company is subject to interest rate risk due to changes to the prime rate since the majority of its borrowings bear variable interest rates. A change in the interest rate of plus or minus one percent as at January 31, 2013 would result in a $54,844 decrease or increase in net income before income taxes. The Company does not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. Liquidity risk The Companys objective is to have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due. The Company monitors its cash balances and cash flows generated from operations to meet its requirements. As at January 31, 2013 and January 31, 2012, the most significant financial liabilities relate to bank indebtedness, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, due to related parties, and long-term debt. F-149 Regional Tire Distributors Inc. Notes to the consolidated financial statements January 31, 2013 and 2012 (Presented in United States Dollars) Credit risk The Company provides credit to its customers in the normal course of its operations. It carries out, on a continuing basis, credit checks on its customers and maintains provisions for contingent credit losses. The Companys maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of financial assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting purposes, assets placed in service are recorded at cost and depreciated using the declining-balance method at annual rates sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets less estimated salvage values over the assets estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their economic useful life or the related lease term. The depreciation rates used to depreciate property, plant and equipment is as follows: Vehicles 30% declining-balance Computer equipment 30% declining-balance Office equipment 20% declining-balance Warehouse equipment 20% declining-balance Leasehold improvements Over the term of the lease Impairment of long-lived assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of definite life long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows generated by such assets is less than the carrying value. Measurement of the impairment loss is based on the present value of the expected future cash flows. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of acquired businesses and is tested for impairment annually and whenever an event or circumstance occurs that indicates that goodwill might be impaired. When the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in net earnings in an amount equal to the excess. Intangible assets Intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships and a tradename acquired through the business acquisition of Regional Tire Distributors (Atlantic) Inc. Amortization is provided using the following methods and annual rates: Customer relationships 12 years straight line Tradename 7 years straight line F-150 Regional Tire Distributors Inc. Notes to the consolidated financial statements January 31, 2013 and 2012 (Presented in United States Dollars) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectability is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered. The Company recognizes revenue when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer, which is upon delivery under free on board (FOB) destination terms. The Company permits customers from time to time to return certain products, but there is no contractual right of return. The Company continuously monitors and tracks such returns and records an estimate of such future returns, which is based on historical experience and recent trends. Customer rebates The Company offers rebates to its customers under a number of different programs. These rebates are recorded in accordance with the accounting standards for consideration given by a vendor to a customer. The majority of these programs provide for the customer to receive rebates, generally in the form of a reduction in the related accounts receivable balance, when certain measures are achieved, generally related to the volume of product purchased from the Company. These rebates are recorded as a reduction of the related price of the product, which reduces the amount of revenue recorded. Throughout the year, the amount of rebates is estimated based on the expected level of purchases to be made by customers that participate in the rebate programs. These estimates are periodically revised to reflect rebates earned by customers based on actual purchases made. Manufacturer rebates The Company receives rebates from its vendors under a number of different programs. These rebates are recorded in accordance with the accounting standards for cash consideration received from a vendor. Many of the vendor programs provide for the Company to receive rebates when any of a number of measures are achieved, generally related to the volume of purchases. These rebates are accounted for as a reduction to the price of the product, which reduces the carrying value of our inventory, and our cost of goods sold when product is sold. 3.

Financial instruments The accounting standard for fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value that is based on the inputs market participants use to determine the fair value of an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy to prioritize those inputs. The fair value hierarchy is comprised of three levels that are described below:  Level 1 Inputs based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  Level 3 Unobservable inputs based on little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The Company has no assets measured at fair value. F-157 Regional Tire Distributors Inc.

Acquisition of Regional Tire Distributors (Atlantic) Inc. On August 3, 2012, the Company acquired an additional 55% share ownership in Atlantic bringing the total share ownership to 93%. Atlantic is a wholesale tire distributor in Eastern Canada. The total purchase price was $4,993,000 ($5,000,000 Canadian dollars). There were also acquisition-related costs incurred of $92,211 ($92,340 Canadian dollars). This acquisition was completed in order to increase the Companys presence in eastern Canada. As discussed in Note 7, the Company held a 38% interest in Atlantic prior to the acquisition. This share investment was accounted for under the equity method. The Company recognized a gain before income taxes of $2,033,068 as a result of measuring at fair value its equity investment in Atlantic before the business combination. The fair value of the equity investment was determined by the implied purchase price of Atlantic based on the $5,000,000 Canadian dollar purchase price for 55% of Atlantic less a 10% minority discount resulting in a fair value of $3,104,700 ($3,109,100 Canadian dollars). The allocation of the purchase price for accounting purposes was as follows: $ Accounts receivable (net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $80,449) 2,316,856 Inventories 9,543,602 Prepaid expenses 107,578 Property, plant and equipment 310,769 Customer relationships 6,890,300 Tradename 599,200 Bank indebtedness (2,520,486 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (6,523,176 ) Note payable (1,913,337 ) Long-term debt (including current portion) (865,453 ) Income taxes payable (85,839 ) Deferred tax liabilities (1,984,718 ) Total identifiable net assets 5,875,296 Goodwill 2,730,804 Total 8,606,100 Total cash consideration paid to vendor 4,993,000 Fair value of previously held equity interest 3,104,700 Fair value of non-controlling interest 508,400 Total 8,606,100 F-159 Regional Tire Distributors Inc. Notes to the consolidated financial statements January 31, 2013 and 2012 (Presented in United States Dollars) The goodwill on the acquisition arose as a result of the value of the assembled workforce and the combined strategic value to our growth plan. The goodwill arising from the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. The revenue and net earnings of the acquiree since the acquisition date included in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income for the period ending January 31, 2013 was $22,839,194 and $1,349,166 respectively. The revenue and net earnings for the Company and Atlantic combined for the year ending January 31, 2013 as though the acquisition date for the business combination was February 1, 2012, would have been $127,298,611 and $6,768,349 respectively. The net earnings have been adjusted for the pro forma amortization of intangible assets of $331,084. The purchase agreement contains a clause that if within five years of the closing date, the Company enters into an agreement to sell the shares of Atlantic, directly or indirectly, and if the transaction is successfully completed, the Company is required to pay additional consideration to the seller. The payment is determined based on a predetermined formula mainly driven by the increase in value of Atlantic in the subsequent purchase. The Company has determined the fair value of this subsequent payment clause on August 3, 2012 to be nominal. 17. Subsequent events On March 22, 2013, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with TriCan Tire Distributors Inc. to sell 100% of the common shares of the Company. The transaction is expected to close April 30, 2013. Events have been evaluated to April 25, 2013, which is the date the financial statements are issued. F-160 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Shareholder of Triwest Trading (Canada) Ltd. Report on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Triwest Trading (Canada) Ltd., which comprise the balance sheets as at December 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and January 1, 2010 and the statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Managements Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Canadian accounting standards for private enterprises, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entitys preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Notes to Financial Statements Year Ended December 31, 2011 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian accounting standards for private enterprises. Any measurement differences between these standards and U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as they apply to Triwest are not material. Measurement uncertainty The financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with Canadian accounting standards for private enterprises. The precise value of many assets and liabilities is dependent on future events. As a result, the preparation of financial statements for a period involves the use of approximations which have been made using careful judgment. Actual results could differ from those approximations. The financial statements have, in managements opinion, been properly prepared within reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the accounting policies summarized below. Financial instruments Measurement of financial instruments The entity initially measures its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, except for certain non arms length transactions. The entity subsequently measures all its financial assets and financial liabilities at amortized cost. Financial assets measured at amortized cost include accounts receivable and long term investments. Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost include the bank indebtedness, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, long term debt, promissory note and due to shareholder. Impairment Financial assets measured at cost are tested for impairment when there are indicators of impairment. The amount of the write down is recognized in net income. The previously recognized impairment loss may be reversed to the extent of the improvement, directly or by adjusting the allowance account, provided it is no greater than the amount that would have been reported at the date of the reversal had the impairment not been recognized previously. The amount of the reversal is recognized in net income. Transaction costs The entity recognizes its transaction costs in net income in the period incurred. However, financial instruments that will not be subsequently measured at fair value are adjusted by the transaction costs that are directly attributable to their origination, issuance or assumption. Inventory Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost being determined on the first in first out cost basis. Supplier rebates and discounts are recognized when the vendor has applied them to the companys account. F-166 TRIWEST TRADING (CANADA) LTD. Notes to Financial Statements Year Ended December 31, 2011 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Property, plant and equipment are amortized over their estimated useful lives at the following rates and methods: Warehouse equipment 20% declining balance method Motor vehicles 30% declining balance method Computer equipment 30% declining balance method Office equipment 20% declining balance method Leasehold improvements 5 years straight line method Long term investments Long term investments are stated at cost. The investments are reduced to reflect any permanent impairment in value. Future income taxes Income taxes are reported using the future income tax method. Current income tax expense is the estimated income taxes payable for the current year after any refunds or the use of losses incurred in previous years. Future income taxes reflect:  the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes;  the benefit of unutilized tax losses that will more likely than not be realized and carried forward to future years to reduce income taxes. Future income taxes are estimated using the rates enacted by tax law and those substantively enacted for the years in which future income tax assets are likely to be realized, or future income tax liabilities settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on future income tax assets and liabilities is included in earnings in the period when the change is substantively enacted. Foreign currency translation Assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses have been translated to the currency of Canada using the following exchange rates: i. Cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilitiesat the rate in effect on the balance sheet date; ii. Inventoryat the average rate in effect during the period; and iii. Revenues and expensesat the average rate in effect during the period. Gains and losses on translation are included in income. F-167 TRIWEST TRADING (CANADA) LTD. Notes to Financial Statements Year Ended December 31, 2011 Revenue recognition Sales are recognized when the products are shipped and title passes to the customer. 2. FIRST TIME ADOPTION OF CANADIAN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISES During the year the company adopted Canadian accounting standards for private enterprises. These financial statements are the first prepared in accordance with these standards. The adoption of these standards did not require restatement of the balance sheet, income statement or opening retained earnings as there were no accounting changes. 3. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The company is exposed to various risks through its financial instruments. The following analysis provides a measure of the companys risk exposure and concentrations at the balance sheet date. Credit Risk Credit risk arises from the potential that a counter party will fail to perform its obligations. The company is exposed to credit risk from customers. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific accounts, historical trends and other information. The company has a significant number of customers which minimizes concentration of credit risk. Currency Risk Currency risk is the risk to the companys earnings that arise from fluctuations of foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility of these rates. The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on cash and accounts payable held in U.S. dollars because it purchases inventory in U.S. dollars. This risk is mitigated by the company maintaining a U.S. dollar bank account and purchasing futures regarding U.S. cash. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument might be adversely affected by a change in the interest rates. In seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations, the company manages exposure through its normal operating and financing activities. The company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through fluctuations in the banks prime rate on its operating line of credit as reported in Note 7. Commodity Risk The company is exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices for fuel and oil which impact freight costs. Commodity prices are affected by many factors including supply, demand and the Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate. The company had no financial hedges or price commodity contracts in place at year end. Liquidity Risk The companys exposure to liquidity risk is dependent on the sale of inventory, collection of accounts receivable, purchasing commitments and obligations or raising of funds to meet commitments and sustain operations. The company controls liquidity risk by management of working capital, cash flows and the availability of borrowing facilities. F-168 TRIWEST TRADING (CANADA) LTD.

LONG TERM INVESTMENTS The investment consists of shares and debentures in a U.S. private company which acts as a buying group for the purchase of tires by wholesale distributors. The investment does not represent a significant influence in the company and accordingly is recorded at cost. Interest is paid annually on the debentures at a rate of 9%. The purchase of the debenture is a requirement of utilizing the purchasing services of the buying group. The debentures are redeemable at the option of the issuer at any time at an amount equal to the issue price plus any accrued interest. No changes in the investment occurred during the year and the current market value is unavailable. F-169 TRIWEST TRADING (CANADA) LTD. Notes to Financial Statements Year Ended December 31, 2011 7.

Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian accounting standards for private enterprises (Canadian GAAP). Any measurement differences in accounting principles between Canadian GAAP and U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as they apply to Triwest are not material. Measurement uncertainty The financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with Canadian accounting standards for private enterprises. The precise value of many assets and liabilities is dependent on future events. As a result, the preparation of financial statements for a period involves the use of approximations which have been made using careful judgment. Actual results could differ from those approximations. The financial statements have, in managements opinion, been properly prepared within reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the accounting policies summarized below. Financial instruments Measurement of financial instruments The entity initially measures its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, except for certain non arms length transactions. The entity subsequently measures all its financial assets and financial liabilities at amortized cost. Financial assets measured at amortized cost include accounts receivable and long term investments. Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost include the bank indebtedness, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, long term debt, and due to shareholder. Impairment Financial assets measured at cost are tested for impairment when there are indicators of impairment. The amount of the write down is recognized in net income. The previously recognized impairment loss may be reversed to the extent of the improvement, directly or by adjusting the allowance account, provided it is no greater than the amount that would have been reported at the date of the reversal had the impairment not been recognized previously. The amount of the reversal is recognized in net income. Transaction costs The entity recognizes its transaction costs in net income in the period incurred. However, financial instruments that will not be subsequently measured at fair value are adjusted by the transaction costs that are directly attributable to their origination, issuance or assumption. Inventory Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost being determined on the first in first out cost basis. Supplier rebates and discounts are recognized when the vendor has applied them to the companys account. F-177 TRIWEST TRADING (CANADA) LTD. Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Property, plant and equipment are amortized over their estimated useful lives at the following rates and methods: Warehouse equipment 20% declining balance method Motor vehicles 30% declining balance method Computer equipment 30% declining balance method Office equipment 20% declining balance method Leasehold improvements 5 years straight line method Long term investments Long term investments are stated at cost. The investments are reduced to reflect any permanent impairment in value. Future income taxes Income taxes are reported using the future income tax method. Current income tax expense is the estimated income taxes payable for the current year after any refunds or the use of losses incurred in previous years. Future income taxes reflect:  the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes;  the benefit of unutilized tax losses that will more likely than not be realized and carried forward to future years to reduce income taxes. Future income taxes are estimated using the rates enacted by tax law and those substantively enacted for the years in which future income taxes assets are likely to be realized, or future income tax liabilities settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on future income tax assets and liabilities is included in earnings in the period when the change is substantively enacted. Foreign currency translation Assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses have been translated to the currency of Canada using the following exchange rates: i. Cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilitiesat the rate in effect on the balance sheet date; ii. Inventoryat the average rate in effect during the period; and iii. Revenues and expensesat the average rate in effect during the period. Gains and losses on translation are included in income. Revenue recognition Sales are recognized when the products are shipped and title passes to the customer. F-178 TRIWEST TRADING (CANADA) LTD. Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) 2. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The company is exposed to various risks through its financial instruments. The following analysis provides a measure of the companys risk exposure and concentrations at the balance sheet date. Credit Risk Credit risk arises from the potential that a counter party will fail to perform its obligations. The company is exposed to credit risk from customers. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific accounts, historical trends and other information. The company has a significant number of customers which minimizes concentration of credit risk. Currency Risk Currency risk is the risk to the companys earnings that arise from fluctuations of foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility of these rates. The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on cash and accounts payable held in U.S. dollars because it purchases inventory in U.S. dollars. This risk is mitigated by the company maintaining a U.S. dollar bank account and purchasing futures regarding U.S. cash. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument might be adversely affected by a change in the interest rates. In seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations, the company manages exposure through its normal operating and financing activities. The company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through fluctuations in the banks prime rate on its operating line of credit as reported in Note 7. Commodity Risk The company is exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices for fuel and oil which impact freight costs. Commodity prices are affected by many factors including supply, demand and the Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate. The company had no financial hedges or price commodity contracts in place at September 30, 2012. Liquidity Risk The companys exposure to liquidity risk is dependent on the sale of inventory, collection of accounts receivable, purchasing commitments and obligations or raising of funds to meet commitments and sustain operations. The company controls liquidity risk by management of working capital, cash flows and the availability of borrowing facilities. 3.

LONG TERM INVESTMENTS The investment consists of shares and debentures in a U.S. private company which acts as a buying group for the purchase of tires by wholesale distributors. The investment does not represent a significant influence in the company and accordingly is recorded at cost. Interest is paid annually on the debentures at a rate of 9%. The purchase of the debenture is a requirement of utilizing the purchasing services of the buying group. The debentures are redeemable at the option of the issuer at any time at an amount equal to the issue price plus any accrued interest. No changes in the investment occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and the current market value is unavailable. 6. BANK INDEBTEDNESS The company has an authorized line of credit in the amount of $30,000,000 (2011$25,000,000) renewed annually.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On November 20, 2012, the companys term loan with BDC as described in Note 7 was paid in full. The principal outstanding on that date was $950,000 and bonus interest and early payout penalty paid in accordance with the terms of the loan was $839,807. On November 30, 2012, the common shares of the company were purchased by ATD Acquisition Co. V Inc.

Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers Section 102(b)(7) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL) enables a corporation to eliminate or limit the personal liability of a director for violations of the directors fiduciary duty, except (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) for liability of directors for unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock purchase or redemptions pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL or (iv) for any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit. Our certificate of incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for actions taken as a director to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL. Section 145(a) of the DGCL provides in relevant part that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another entity, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such persons conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such persons conduct was unlawful. Section 145(b) of the DGCL provides in relevant part that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or II-1 in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another entity, against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. Our certificate of incorporation provides that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that the indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to the certificate of incorporation, are not exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or otherwise. Section 145(f) of the DGCL further provides that a right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses arising under a provision of the certificate of incorporation shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to such provision after the occurrence of the act or omission which is the subject of the civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with certain of our directors. Such agreements generally provide for indemnification by reason of being our director, as the case may be. These agreements are in addition to the indemnification provided by our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The underwriting agreement provides that the underwriters are obligated, under certain circumstances, to indemnify our directors, officers and controlling persons against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Please refer to the form of underwriting agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto. In connection with our acquisition by affiliates of TPG Global, LLC (together with its affiliates, TPG), we entered into an indemnification agreement pursuant to which we agreed to indemnify TPG, including the TPG funds invested in us and their respective affiliates, against liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by TPG arising out of or in connection with securities offerings, including liabilities under the securities laws, actions or failures to act by us or our affiliates generally, or the performance by TPG of services under the transaction and monitoring fee agreement described above. We also maintain officers and directors liability insurance that insures against liabilities that our officers and directors may incur in such capacities. Section 145(g) of the DGCL provides that a corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another entity, against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under that section.

Undertakings The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes: (1) That for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (2) That for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) For the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser, if the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. (4) The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. (5) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the II-4 registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. (6) To provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser. II-5 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the city of Huntersville, North Carolina on June 16, 2014.
