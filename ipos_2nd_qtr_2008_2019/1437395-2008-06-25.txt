SUMMARY INFORMATION ABOUT PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC ("PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC") is a development stage company, incorporated in the State of Florida on November 13, 2007, to develop a website and sell pashmina and other accessories on that website. Our intent is to begin by purchasing product from Jenlis, Inc a respected seller in that field. The initial advantage to purchasing from Jenlis, Inc is the availability of quality product without a need to carry extensive inventory. Jenlis, Inc has an established internet retail and wholesale business and would benefit by expanding its wholesale business presence. Jenlis, Inc is a direct importer maintaining a substantial inventory in South Florida. There is already an extensive market for pashmina for casual wear as well as for bridal parties, corporate events, and holiday gifts. The internet provides the lowest cost marketing arena with the broadest audience for these type products. Once established, the marketing model can be expanded to many other products limited primarily by the ability to establish similar advantageous purchasing arrangements. We have not generated any revenues to date and our activities have been limited to developing our business plan. We will not have the necessary capital to develop or execute our business plan until we are able to secure financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on suitable terms. 6 There is $5,828 cash on hand in our corporate bank account. PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC currently has accounts payable and liabilities of $0 as of May 31, 2008. In addition PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC anticipates that the costs associated with this offering will be approximately $5,000. As of the date of this prospectus, we have not generated or realized any revenues from our business operations. The following financial operation summarizes the more complete historical financial information as indicated on the audited financial statements we have filed with this prospectus. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY The company does not own any real estate or other properties. The company's office is located at 9694 Royal Palm Blvd., Coral Springs, FL 33065 and our telephone number is 954-856-5718. Our fax number is 954-755-5115. Our Domain Name is www.pashminadepot.com the business office is located at the home of Edward Sanders, the CEO of the company at no charge to the company. SUMMARY OF OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION Balance Sheet As of May 31, 2008 ------------------ ------------------ Total Assets $ 5,828 Total Liabilities $ 0 Equity $ 5,828 For the Year ended Operating Data May 31, 2008 ------------------ ------------------ Revenue Nil Net Loss $ 172 Net Loss Per Share $ 0 PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC has no revenues and has achieved losses since inception.

RISK FACTORS Please consider the following risk factors and other information in this prospectus relating to our business and prospects before deciding to invest in our common stock.

You should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this prospectus before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The Company considers the following to be the material risks for an investor regarding this offering. Secure Window should be viewed as a high-risk investment and speculative in nature. An investment in our common stock may result in a complete loss of the invested amount. Please consider the following risk factors before deciding to invest in our common stock. 7 AUDITOR'S GOING CONCERN - ----------------------- THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE ABILITY OF PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC. TO CONTINUE ITS OPERATIONS AS A GOING CONCERN In their audit report dated May 31, 2008; our auditors have expressed an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business. Because our officers may be unwilling or unable to loan or advance any additional capital to Pashminadepot.com, Inc. we believe that if we do not raise additional capital within 12 months of the effective date of this registration statement, we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plans. Due to the fact that there is no minimum investment and no refunds on sold shares, you may be investing in a Company that will not have the funds necessary to develop its business strategies. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your entire investment. Because the Company has been issued an opinion by its auditors that substantial doubt exists as to whether it can continue as a going concern it may be more difficult to attract investors. RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION - ---------------------------------------- SINCE PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC. ANTICIPATES OPERATING EXPENSES WILL INCREASE PRIOR TO EARNING REVENUE, IT MAY NEVER ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY The Company anticipates an increase in its operating expenses, without realizing any revenues from the sale of its products. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that the Company will prove successful. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that our products will attract customers; generate any operating revenue or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unable to address these risks, there is a high probability that our business can fail, which will result in the loss of your entire investment. OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING, RESULTING IN THE COMPLETE LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT If we are not successful in earning revenue once we have started our sale activities, we may require additional financing to sustain our business operations. Currently, we do not have any arrangements for financing and can provide no assurances to investors that we will be able to obtain any when required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors, including the Company's sales results. These factors may have an affect on the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing and make such additional financing unavailable to us. See "Description of Business." No assurance can be given that the Company will obtain access to capital markets in the future or that adequate financing to satisfy the cash requirements of implementing our business strategies will be available on acceptable terms. The inability of the Company to gain access to capital markets or obtain acceptable financing could have a material adverse effect upon the results of its operations and its financial conditions. IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING, OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL, WHICH WILL RESULT IN THE COMPLETE LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT. 8 SINCE WE LACK AN OPERATING HISTORY, WE FACE A HIGH RISK OF BUSINESS FAILURE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT. PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC is a development stage company and has not yet begun to execute its business plan. Thus, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that we will be able to operate the business successfully. We were incorporated on November 13, 2007 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities and business planning. Based upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods. We will incur these losses due to expenses associated with developing the business plan. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating revenue in the future, or in raising funds through the sale of our shares, adequate to pay for our business operations and planned expenditures. As of the date of this prospectus, we have earned no revenue. Failure to generate revenue will cause us to go out of business, which will result in the complete loss of your investment. AS OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS OTHER OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, HE MAY BE UNABLE TO DEVOTE A MAJORITY OF HIS TIME TO THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT, THERE MAY BE PERIODIC INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR OPERATIONS AND OUR BUSINESS COULD FAIL. Mr. Sanders, our sole officer and director, has other outside business activities and is devoting only approximately 10-25 hours per week to our operations. Our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are not convenient to Mr. Sanders, which may result in periodic interruptions or suspensions of our business plan. If the demands of the company's business require the full time of our executive officer, he is prepared to adjust his timetable in order to devote more time to conducting our business operations. However, our executive officer may be unable to devote sufficient time to the management of the company's business, which may result in periodic interruptions in the implementation of the company's business plans and operations. Such delays could have a significant negative effect on the success of our business. SHOULD OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR LEAVE THE COMPANY, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS. The company is entirely dependent on the efforts and abilities of its sole officer and director. The loss of our sole officer and director could have a material adverse effect on the business and its prospects. The company believes that all commercially reasonable efforts have been made to minimize the risks attendant the departure from service of our current sole officer and director. However, replacement personnel may be unavailable to us. Moreover, even if available, replacement personnel may not enable the company to operate profitably. All decisions regarding the management of the company's affairs will be made exclusively by its sole officer and director. Purchasers of the offered shares may not participate in the management of the company and, therefore, are dependent upon the management abilities of the company's sole officer and director. The only assurance that the shareholders of the company (including purchasers of the offered shares) have that the company's sole officer and director will not abuse his discretion in making decisions, with respect to its affairs and other business decisions, is his fiduciary obligations and business integrity. Accordingly, no person should purchase offered shares unless that person is willing to entrust all aspects of management to the company's sole officer and director, or his successors. Potential purchasers of the offered shares must carefully evaluate the personal experience and business performance of the company's management. 9 The company's management may retain independent contractors to provide services to the company. Those contractors have no fiduciary duty to the shareholders of the company and may not perform as expected. The company does not maintain key person life insurance on its sole officer and director. IF WE CANNOT SECURE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, OR IF AVAILABLE CAPITAL IS TOO EXPENSIVE, OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL. Developing and executing our business plan of establishing internet sales of pashmina and related accessories may require a significant capital investment. Debt or equity financing may not be available for us to do so, or if available may be too expensive. To start executing our planned service requires an initial investment of approximately $45,000, and we anticipate 12 months of operational losses at approximately $3,000 per month before we can generate adequate cash flow to cover operations. IF WE EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDING ESTABLISHING A SUBSTANTIAL INVENTORY, AND FAIL TO MANAGE THE RESULTING GROWTH EFFECTIVELY, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE HARMED. Our plans including developing name recognition for our private label products may not occur. Our growth strategy is subject to significant risks which you should carefully consider before purchasing the shares we are offering. Although we plan on researching our market carefully, we may be slow to achieve profitability, or may not become profitable at all, which will result in losses. There can be no assurance that we will succeed. Our systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support the expansion of our business operations. The combination of product cost, maintenance of inventory, marketing expenses and shipping costs may exceed our revenues. Significant growth will place managerial demands on all aspects of our operations. Our future operating results will depend substantially upon our ability to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our purchasing, marketing, and distribution. RISKS RELATED TO THIS OFFERING - ------------------------------ BECAUSE THERE IS NO PUBLIC TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESELL YOUR STOCK There is currently no public trading market for our common stock. Therefore, there is no central place, such as a stock exchange or electronic trading system, to resell your shares. If you do want to resell your shares, you will have to locate a buyer and negotiate your own sale. The offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the Company's shares have been arbitrarily determined by the Company and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective criteria of value. Additionally, as the Company was formed recently and has only a limited operating history and no earnings, the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings and no investment banker, appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares. INVESTORS WILL PAY MORE FOR "PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC" COMMON STOCK THAN THE PRO RATA PORTION OF OUR ASSETS ARE WORTH; AS A RESULT INVESTING IN THE COMMON STOCK MAY RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE LOSS. 10 AS WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO MARKET FOR OUR SHARES, SHAREHOLDERS MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL THEIR SHARES. EVEN IF A MARKET SHOULD DEVELOP, THE PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE AND SHAREHOLDERS MAY LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. Further, even if a market develops, our common stock will be subject to price fluctuations and volatility. The company cannot apply directly to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. Additionally, the stock can be listed or traded only to the extent that there is interest by broker/dealers in acting as a market maker in the company's stock. Despite the company's best efforts, the company may not be able to convince any broker/dealers to act as market-makers and make quotations on the OTC Bulletin Board. It is the company's intent to contact potential market makers for the OTC Bulletin Board after it has completed its primary offering. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY'S SHARES ARE TRADED, THEY MAY TRADE UNDER $5.00 PER SHARE AND THUS WILL BE A PENNY STOCK. TRADING IN PENNY STOCKS HAS MANY RESTRICTIONS AND THESE RESTRICTIONS COULD SEVERELY AFFECT THE PRICE AND LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY'S SHARES. In the event our shares are traded, and our stock trades below $5.00 per share our stock would be known as a "penny stock" which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given to you prior to purchase of any penny stock. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") has adopted regulations which generally define a "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Depending on market fluctuations, our common stock could be considered to be a "penny stock". A penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities. In addition he must receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. He must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser. Consequently, the "penny stock" rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our common stock to resell them. These disclosures require you to acknowledge you understand the risk associated with buying penny stocks and that you can absorb the entire loss of your investment. Penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume. Consequently, the price of the stock is oftentimes volatile and you may not be able to buy or sell the stock when you want. AS THE COMPANY HAS 100,000,000 AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES and 10,000,000 AUTHORIZED PREFERRED SHARES., THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT COULD ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES DILUTING THE COMPANY'S CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. The company has 100,000,000 authorized common shares of which only 8,500,000 are currently outstanding and will be issued and outstanding if all the shares in this offering are sold. The company's management could, without the consent of the company's existing shareholders issue substantially more shares causing a large dilution in our current shareholders' equity position. Additionally, large share issuances by the company would generally have a negative impact on our share price. It is possible that due to additional share issuance you could lose a substantial amount or all of your investment. AS OUR COMPANY'S SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR CURRENTLY OWNS 100 % OF THE OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, INVESTORS MAY FIND DECISIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY'S SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR CONTRARY TO THEIR INTERESTS. 11 The company's sole officer and director owns approximately 100 % of our currently outstanding common stock. As a result, he will be able to decide who will be directors and control the direction of the company. Our sole officer and director's interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. Factors that could cause his interests to differ from the interests of other stockholders include the impact of corporate transactions on the timing of our business operations and his ability to continue to manage the business, in terms of the amount of time he is able to devote to the company. IF WE FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION OR ARE FORCED INTO BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION, INVESTORS WILL LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. If we file for bankruptcy protection, or a petition for involuntary bankruptcy is filed by creditors against us, all funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to the bankruptcy laws. In this case, you will lose your investment and your funds will be used to pay creditors. INVESTING IN THE COMPANY IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND COULD RESULT IN THE ENTIRE LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT Purchasing the offered shares is highly speculative and involves significant risk. The offered shares should not be purchased by any person who cannot afford to lose their entire investment. The business objectives of the Company are also speculative, and it is possible that we would be unable to accomplish them. The Company's shareholders may be unable to realize a substantial or any return on their purchase of the offered shares and may lose their entire investment. For this reason, each prospective purchaser of the offered shares should read this prospectus and all of its exhibits carefully and consult with their attorney, business and/or investment advisor. INVESTING IN OUR COMPANY MAY RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE LOSS BECAUSE BUYERS WILL PAY MORE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK THAN THE PRO RATA PORTION OF THE ASSETS ARE WORTH The Company has only been recently formed and has only a limited operating history and no earnings, therefore, the price of the offered shares is not based on any data. The offering price and other terms and conditions regarding the Company's shares have been arbitrarily determined and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective criteria of value. No investment banker, appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares. The arbitrary offering price of $0.01 per common share as determined herein is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of the Company's common stock. Pashminadepot.com, Inc.'s assets do not substantiate a share price of $0.01. This premium in share price applies to the terms of this offering and does not attempt to reflect any forward looking share price subsequent to the Company obtaining a listing on any exchange, or becoming quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. You may never realize a return on your investment. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT A PURCHASER OF SHARES WILL REALIZE A RETURN ON HIS INVESTMENT OR THAT HE WILL NOT LOSE HIS ENTIRE INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY. To date, the company has limited operations and revenues. We have never earned a profit and there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve profitable operations. Our ability to implement our business plan is dependent, among other things, on the completion of this Offering. If we fail to raise any or a sufficient amount of money in this offering, we may fail as a business. Even if we raise sufficient amount of funding in this Offering, there can be no assurance that our business model will succeed. 12 We are a development stage company formed November 13, 2007 with the purpose to establish itself as a corporation engaged in the sale of pashmina and other accessories on the internet. PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC may be unable to establish "traffic" on the internet and would then be unable to generate revenues. Additionally, internet advertising expenses such as pay per click with search engines (Google, Yahoo etc) could exceed revenues. There would be a substantial doubt, then, about our ability to continue as a going concern. We anticipate incurring losses during the period of time necessary to develop internet traffic and to be recognized by the major search engines. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will ever operate profitably, even if this offering is successful. Investors should not purchase shares in this offering unless they can afford to lose their entire investment. Because we are a newly formed company, there is no corporate operating history on which to evaluate our potential for success. Additionally, we face many risks inherent in a start-up business, including difficulties and delays frequently encountered in connection with the commencement of operations, operational difficulties and our potential underestimation of initial and ongoing costs. We are also dependent, at least initially, on one primary source of supply. Over time, we might be able to diversify our sources. Executing the business plan requires that we spend significant funds based entirely on our preliminary evaluation of the potential of the market. It is impossible to predict the success of our business before marketing starts. The ability of the company to generate revenues will depend upon a variety of unpredictable factors, including: The internet has many other companies selling these products, some of whom have established reputations, better and less expensive sources of supply, more diverse product lines, and high levels of recognition in the major search engines. Because there may be a substantial delay between the completion of this offering and the business plan execution, our expenses may be increased and it may take us longer to generate revenues. We have no way to predict when we will begin to generate sales. There is No Minimum Number of Shares we have to sell in this Offering. We are making this offering on a "best efforts, no minimum basis." What this means is that all the net proceeds from this Offering will be immediately available for use by us and we don't have to wait until a minimum number of Shares have been sold to keep the proceeds from any sales. We can't assure you that subscriptions for the entire Offering will be obtained. We have the right to terminate the offering of the Shares at any time, regardless of the number of Shares we have sold since there is no minimum subscription requirement. Our ability to meet our financial obligations and cash needs and to achieve our objectives could be adversely affected if the entire offering of Shares is not fully subscribed for. State Blue Sky laws may limit resale of the Shares. The holders of our shares of common stock and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there may be significant state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares. Accordingly, even if we are successful in having the Shares available for trading on the OTCBB, investors should consider any secondary market for the Company's securities to be a limited one. We intend to seek coverage and publication of information regarding the Company in an accepted publication 13 which permits a "manual exemption." This manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being registered if the company issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state. However, it is not enough for the security to be listed in a recognized manual. The listing entry must contain (1) the names of issuers, officers, and directors, (2) an issuer's balance sheet, and (3) a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations. Furthermore, the manual exemption is a nonissuer exemption restricted to secondary trading transactions, making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities. Most of the accepted manuals are those published in Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Service, Fitch's Investment Service, and Best's Insurance Reports, and many states expressly recognize these manuals. A smaller number of states declare that they 'recognize securities manuals' but do not specify the recognized manuals. The following states do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption: Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and Wisconsin. If we do not execute our business plan on schedule or within budget, our ability to generate revenue may be diminished or delayed. Our ability to adhere to our schedule and budget face many uncertainties WE DO NOT MAINTAIN PRODUCT LIABILITY COVERAGE. WE COULD BECOME LIABLE FOR UNINSURED PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. HOWEVER, WE INTEND TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS LIABILITY RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS IF WE CANNOT EFFECTIVELY DEVELOP A QUALITY INTERNET SITE, WE WILL NOT ATTRACT CUSTOMERS. EVEN IF WE DO CREATE A QUALITY INTERNET SITE, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THIS CAN BE CONVERTED TO PROFITABLE SALES. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements regarding management's plans and objectives for future operations, including plans and objectives relating to our planned entry into our service business. The forward-looking statements and associated risks set forth in this prospectus include or relate to, among other things, (a) our projected profitability, (b) our growth strategies, (c) anticipated trends in our industry, (d) our ability to obtain and retain sufficient capital for future operations, and (e) our anticipated needs for working capital. These statements may be found under "Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation" and "Description of Business," as well as in this prospectus generally. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, the risks outlined under "Risk Factors" and matters described in this prospectus generally. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus may not in fact occur. The forward-looking statements herein are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements are based on the assumptions that we will be able to continue our business strategies on a timely basis, that we will attract customers, that there will be no material adverse competitive or in the conditions under which our business operates, that our sole officer and director will remain employed as such, and that our forecasts accurately anticipate market demand. The foregoing assumptions are based on judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions, and future business decisions, all 14 of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any such assumption could prove to be inaccurate and therefore there can be no assurance that the results contemplated in forward-looking statements will be realized. In addition, as disclosed elsewhere in this "Risk Factors" section of this prospectus, there are a number of other risks inherent in our business and operations, which could cause our operating results to vary markedly and adversely from prior results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Increases in the cost of our services, or in our general or administrative expenses, or the occurrence of extraordinary events, could cause actual results to vary materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Management decisions, including budgeting, are subjective in many respects and subject to periodic revisions in order to reflect actual business conditions and developments. The impact of such conditions and developments could lead us to alter our marketing, capital investment or other expenditures and may adversely affect the results of our operations. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking information included in this prospectus, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved. USE OF PROCEEDS Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per share is $0.01 The funds raised through this offering will be used to develop and complete the business and marketing plan. DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE As there is no established public market for our shares, the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to our shares have been arbitrarily determined by PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value, or any other objective criteria of value. In addition, no investment banker, appraiser, or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares. The price of the current offering is fixed at $0.01 per share. This price is significantly greater than the price paid by the company's sole officer and director for common equity since the company's inception on November 13, 2007. The company's sole officer and director paid $0.001 per share, a difference of $0.009 per share lower than the share price in this offering. DILUTION OF THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR YOUR SHARES Dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders. The following tables compare the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing stockholders. 15 Financial Position of the COMPANY IF ALL SHARES ARE SOLD - -------------------------------------------------------- Price per share ............................................... $ 0.01 Net tangible book value per share before offering ............. $ 0.001 Potential gain to existing shareholders ....................... $ 0.003 Net tangible book value per share after offering .............. $ 0.004 Increase to present stockholders in net tangible book value per share after offering .................................... $ 0.003 Capital contributions ......................................... $ 6000 Number of shares outstanding before the offering .............. 6,000,000 Number of shares after offering held by existing stockholders . 6,000,000 Percentage of ownership after offering ........................ 71% PURCHASERS OF SHARES IN THIS OFFERING IF ALL SHARES SOLD - -------------------------------------------------------- Price per share ............................................... $ 0.01 Dilution per share ............................................ $ 0.009 Capital contributions ......................................... $ 25,000 Percentage of capital contributions ........................... 81% Number of shares after offering held by public investors ...... 2,500,000 Percentage of ownership after offering ........................ 29% THE OFFERING BY THE COMPANY PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC is registering 2,500,000 shares of its common stock for offer and sale.

We currently plan to have our common stock listing on the OTC Bulletin Board, subject to the effectiveness of this Registration Statement. In addition, a market maker will be required to file a Form 211 with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority before the market maker will be able to make a market in our shares of common stock. At the date hereof, we are not aware that any market maker has any such intention. All of the shares registered herein will become tradable on the effective date of this registration statement. The company will not offer the shares through a broker-dealer or anyone affiliated with a broker-dealer.

There is currently one (1) shareholder of our common stock. The company is hereby registering 2,500,000 common shares. The price per share is $0.01 and will remain so unless and until the shares are quoted on the Over-The-Counter (OTC) Bulletin Board or an exchange. In the event the company receives payment for the sale of their shares, PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC. will receive all of the proceeds from such sales. PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC. is bearing all expenses in connection with the registration of the shares of the company. 16 PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We are offering the shares on a "self-underwritten" basis directly through Edward Sanders, our executive officer and director named herein, who will not receive any commissions or other remuneration of any kind for selling shares in this offering, except for the reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the sale of the common stock. The offering will conclude when all 2,500,000 shares of common stock have been sold, or 90 days after this registration statement becomes effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission. PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC may at its discretion extend the offering for an additional 90 days. This offering is a self-underwritten offering, which means that it does not involve the participation of an underwriter to market, distribute or sell the shares offered under this prospectus. We will sell shares on a continuous basis. We reasonably expect the amount of securities registered pursuant to this offering to be offered and sold within two years from this initial effective date of this registration. In connection with their selling efforts in the offering, Mr. Sanders will not register as broker-dealers pursuant to Section 15 of the Exchange Act, but rather will rely upon the "safe harbor" provisions of Rule 3a4-1 under the Exchange Act. Generally speaking, Rule 3a4-1 provides an exemption from the broker-dealer registration requirements of the Exchange Act for persons associated with an issuer that participate in an offering of the issuer's securities. Mr. Sanders is not subject to any statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act.

The company is registering an additional 2,500,000 shares of its common stock for possible resale at the price of $0.01 per share.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are not a party to any material legal proceedings and to our knowledge; no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by any party. BUSINESS INTRODUCTION PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC is a development stage company and was incorporated in Florida on November 13, 2007; to sell pashmina shawls and other related accessories on the internet We intend to create a website and market it through effective use of internet advertising such as Google and Yahoo pay per click. The internet is the broadest medium in existence, so if you market something on the internet, it will have the widest reach with the most effective cost basis Internet sales are in a rapidly increasing cycle. We have not generated any revenues to date and our activities have been limited to developing the Business Plan. We will not have the necessary capital to develop our Business Plan until we are able to secure financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on suitable terms. See "Managements Discussion and Analysis Plan of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources." We have no plans to change our business activities or to combine with another business and are not aware of any events or circumstances that might cause us to change our plans. We have no revenues, have achieved losses since inception, have no operations, have been issued a going concern opinion and rely upon the sale of our securities to funds operations. 18 The following description of our business is intended to provide an understanding of our Company and the direction of our strategy. STRATEGY AND SERVICE We have established through market research that there is an extensive market for pashmina via the internet for a variety of social events such as weddings as well as corporate events and also for individual use and gifts. PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC intends to purchase pashmina on a wholesale basis, at least initially, from Jenlis Inc and resell them via the internet. Jenlis Inc. has been selling pashmina both retail and wholesale on the internet for 3 years and has an established reputation for a quality product. The key to our marketing and business strategy is to rely on maintaining our own inventory rather than rely on drop shipping. We believe this would give us the best opportunity to control product and customer service. We intend to replicate and expand the success of our primary supplier Jenlis, Inc. We intend to provide a business model of controlling inventory and providing exceptional customer service. We believe that business model can be successfully translated to many other products. Mr. Sanders, our CEO, prior to the November 13, 2007 start up of PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC has been instrumental in validating the business concept of PASHMINADEPOT.COM, Inc. He has: o Been a founder, principal, and officer of Jenlis, Inc. o Been instrumental in the development of AmazingCollections.com, a DBA of Jenlis, Inc that has been selling pashmina on the internet since 2005, including the change to being a direct importer of private label product. o Been instrumental in the development of Lookingforluck.com, a DBA of Jenlis, Inc as a retail and wholesale seller of another product line on the internet since 2006. Mr. Sanders, our CEO, brings start-up experience and successful internet sales experience to PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC. THE MARKET There is no way to accurately estimate the overall market for pashmina sales on the internet, however we can rely on the knowledge that Amazingcollections.com has developed sales exceeding $200,000 annually. That business started as a home "hobby" business until renting a warehouse and developing its own private label with the greatest growth coming in the past 18 months. It is believed that the overall internet market for this product group is literally thousands of times what is currently serviced by Jenlis, Inc and that exceptional customer service will allow PASHMINADEPOT.COM, Inc. to capture an effective share of that market. MANAGEMENT It is intended that our CEO will provide all the labor for the company initially and then hiring either employees or using independent contractors as sales growth demands. 19 SALES AND MARKETING We intend to hire an independent contractor to do the website development and maintenance. There are many such companies readily available through prior experience with Jenlis, Inc. We believe we can do this in an economical and effective manner. ADVERTISING Advertising will be done primarily through internet search engines. Mr. Sanders has effective experience in the utilization of pay per click advertising through this process. Additionally there are methods of improving "web presence" on search engines by means without the need for pay per click. Both methods will be used try to establish PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC. COMPETITION There are many competitors on the internet selling similar products. We believe the most effective way to be successful against this competition is a combination of quality product and exceptional customer service. Our experience tells us that there are many companies selling inferior product and very few companies willing to truly put their stamp on customer service. Utilizing the Jenlis, Inc. model, PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC intends to make itself available by phone and email to customers on a personal level This means that the website will have the personal cell number of the principals as well as the home address. Inquiries will typically be responded to within minutes. This type of service is typically lacking in internet sales and is extraordinarily received. STAFFING As of June, 2008, PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC. has no permanent staff other than its sole officer and director, Edward Sanders, who is the President and Chairman of the company. Mr. Sanders has the flexibility to work on PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC up to 10 to 25 hours per week. He is prepared to devote more time to our operations as may be required. He is not being paid at present. EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS At present, PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC has no employees other than its current sole officer and director, Mr. Sanders, who has not been compensated. There are no employment agreements in existence. The company presently does not have, pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, the company may adopt plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to the company's director. During the initial implementation of our marketing strategy, the company intends to hire independent consultants to develop its website, rather than hire full time website development/maintenance employees. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION This section of the prospectus includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: "believe", "expect", "estimate", "anticipate", "intend", "project" and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. 20 We are a development stage company organized to develop an internet sales site and product distribution model. We have not yet generated or realized any revenues from business operations. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve (12) months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we begin marketing our products to customers. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than revenues generated such as from the proceeds of loans we undertake. From inception to May 31, 2008, the company's business operations have primarily been focused on developing our business plan and market research. LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC was incorporated in the State of Florida on November 13, 2007; we are a development stage company attempting to enter into the internet sales market. We have not generated any revenues from our operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including the financial risks associated with the limited capital resources currently available to us for the implementation of our business strategies. (See "Risk Factors"). To become profitable and competitive, we must develop the business and marketing plan, execute the plan, obtain inventory and develop a shipping and product distribution structure. Our sole officer and director undertakes to provide us with initial operating and loan capital to sustain our business plan over the next twelve (12) month period partially through this offering and will seek alternative financing through means such as borrowings from institutions or private individuals. PLAN OF OPERATION Over the 12 month period starting upon the effective date of this registration statement, the company must raise capital in order to complete the Business and Marketing Plan and to commence the execution. Since inception (November 13, 2007) to, May 31, 2008, PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC has spent a total of $ 172 on start-up costs. The company has not generated any revenue from business operations. All proceeds currently held by the company are the result of the sale of common stock to its officers. The company incurred expenditures of $3,000 for accounting services, the preparation of audited financial statements and legal services. The company also had expenditures of $172 for general administrative costs. Since inception, the majority of the company's time has been spent refining its business plan and marketing, conducting industry research, and preparing for a primary financial offering. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of the date of this registration statement, we have yet to generate any revenues from our business operations. On November 13, 2007, PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC issued 6,000,000 shares of common stock to our sole officer and director for cash proceeds of $0.001 per share. 21 As we anticipate needing a minimum of $45,000 in order to execute our business plan in a meaningful way over the next year, the available cash is not sufficient to allow us to commence full execution of our business plan. Our business expansion will require significant capital resources that may be funded through the issuance of common stock or of notes payable or other debt arrangements that may affect our debt structure. Despite our current financial status we believe that we may be able to issue notes payable or debt instruments in order to start executing our Business and Marketing Plan. We anticipate that receipt of such financing may require granting a security interest in the service offering, but are willing to grant such interest to secure the necessary funding. Through May, 2008 we have spent a total of $172 in general operating expenses. We raised the cash amounts used in these activities from our officer. To date, we have managed to keep our monthly cash flow requirement low for two reasons. First, our sole officer has agreed not to draw a salary until a minimum of $500,000 in funding is obtained or until we have achieved $500,000 in gross revenues. Second, we have been able to keep our operating expenses to a minimum by operating in space owned by our sole officer and are only paying the direct expenses associated with our business operations. Given our low monthly cash flow requirement and the agreement of our officer, management believes that, even though our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and assuming that we do not commence our anticipated operations it has sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months. In the early stages of our company, we will need cash for completing the business and marketing plan. We anticipate that during the first year, in order to execute our business plan to any meaningful degree, we would need to spend a minimum of $45,000 on such endeavors. If we are unable to raise the funds partially through this offering we will seek alternative financing through means such as borrowings from institutions or private individuals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to keep costs from being more than these estimated amounts or that we will be able to raise such funds. Even if we sell all shares offered through this registration statement, we expect that we will seek additional financing in the future. However, we may not be able to obtain additional capital or generate sufficient revenues to fund our operations. If we are unsuccessful at raising sufficient funds, for whatever reason, to fund our operations, we may be forced to seek a buyer for our business or another entity with which we could create a joint venture. If all of these alternatives fail, we expect that we will be required to seek protection from creditors under applicable bankruptcy laws. Our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and believes that our ability is dependent on our ability to implement our business plan, raise capital and generate revenues. See Note 6 of our financial statements. MANAGEMENT OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS Our sole officer and director will serve until his successor is elected and qualified. Our officers are elected by the Board of Directors to a term of one (1) year and serve until their successor is duly elected and qualified, or until they are removed from office. The Board of Directors has no nominating, auditing or compensation committees. 22 The name, address, age and position of our president, secretary/treasurer, and director and vice president is set forth below: Name and Address Age Position(s) - ---------------- --- ----------- Edward Sanders 63 President, Secretary/ Treasurer 9694 Royal Palm Blvd. Principal Executive Officer Coral Springs, FL 33065 Principal Financial Officer and sole member of the Board of Directors The person named above has held his offices/positions since the inception of our company and is expected to hold his offices/positions until the next annual meeting of our stockholders. COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Our Board of Directors has not established any committees, including an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee or a Nominating Committee, any committee performing a similar function. The functions of those committees are being undertaken by the entire board as a whole. Because we do not have any independent directors, our Board of Directors believes that the establishment of committees of the Board would not provide any benefits to our company and could be considered more form than substance. We do not have a policy regarding the consideration of any director candidates which may be recommended by our stockholders, including the minimum qualifications for director candidates, nor has our Board of Directors established a process for identifying and evaluating director nominees. We have not adopted a policy regarding the handling of any potential recommendation of director candidates by our stockholders, including the procedures to be followed. Our Board has not considered or adopted any of these policies as we have never received a recommendation from any stockholder for any candidate to serve on our Board of Directors. Given our relative size and lack of directors and officers insurance coverage, we do not anticipate that any of our stockholders will make such a recommendation in the near future. While there have been no nominations of additional directors proposed, in the event such a proposal is made, all members of our Board will participate in the consideration of director nominees. None of our directors is an "audit committee financial expert" within the meaning of Item 401(e) of Regulation S-B. In general, an "audit committee financial expert" is an individual member of the audit committee or Board of Directors who: o understands generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements, o is able to assess the general application of such principles in connection with accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves, o has experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements comparable to the breadth and complexity to our financial statements, o understands internal controls over financial reporting, and o understands audit committee functions. 23 Our Board of Directors is comprised of individuals who were integral to our formation and who are involved in our day to day operations. While we would prefer that one or more of our directors be an audit committee financial expert, none of these individuals who have been key to our development have professional backgrounds in finance or accounting. As with most small, early stage companies until such time our company further develops its business, achieves a stronger revenue base and has sufficient working capital to purchase directors and officers insurance, we do not have any immediate prospects to attract independent directors. When we are able to expand our Board of Directors to include one or more independent directors, we intend to establish an Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. It is our intention that one or more of these independent directors will also qualify as an audit committee financial expert. Our securities are not quoted on an exchange that has requirements that a majority of our Board members be independent and we are not currently otherwise subject to any law, rule or regulation requiring that all or any portion of our Board of Directors include "independent" directors, nor are we required to establish or maintain an Audit Committee or other committee of our Board of Directors. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND WE HAVE NOT VOLUNTARILY IMPLEMENTED VARIOUS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MEASURES, IN THE ABSENCE OF WHICH, STOCKHOLDERS MAY HAVE MORE LIMITED PROTECTIONS AGAINST INTERESTED DIRECTOR TRANSACTIONS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND SIMILAR MATTERS. Recent Federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or The NASDAQ Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address Board of Directors ' independence, audit committee oversight, and the adoption of a code of ethics. Our Board of Directors is comprised of one individual who is also our executive officer. Our executive officer makes decisions on all significant corporate matters such as the approval of terms of the compensation of our executive officer and the oversight of the accounting functions. Although we have adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct we have not yet adopted any of these other corporate governance measures and, since our securities are not yet listed on a national securities exchange, we are not required to do so. We have not adopted corporate governance measures such as an audit or other independent committees of our Board of Directors as we presently do not have any independent directors. If we expand our board membership in future periods to include additional independent directors, we may seek to establish an audit and other committees of our Board of Directors. It is possible that if our Board of Directors included independent directors and if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, stockholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. For example, in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees may be made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions. 24 CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS In November 2007 we adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct which is applicable to our employees and which also includes a Code of Ethics for our CEO and principal financial officers and persons performing similar functions. A code of ethics is a written standard designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote o honest and ethical conduct, o full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in regulatory filings and public statements, o compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, o the prompt reporting violation of the code, and o accountability for adherence to the code. A copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to our SB-2 filing. Any person desiring a copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, can obtain one by going to Edgar and looking at the attachments to our SB-2 BACKGROUND OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS EDWARD SANDERS, PRESIDENT, CEO, DIRECTOR, SECRETARY/TREASURER RESUME EDWARD SANDERS 2005 to present - Vice president Jenlis, Inc an internet sales company with several websites. 1990 to present - Corporate Express Imaging Corporate Express Imaging is the largest computer supply dealer in the US. For the first 6 years Mr. Sanders was in sales and since that time he has been the director of the bid department. Corporate Express Imaging is a wholly owned division of Corporate Express Inc, a NYSE company. Corporate Express Imaging has sales in excess of $450 million annually. Corporate Express, Inc has Revenues in excess of $9 billion. 1983 to 1990 Partner in Silky Button Company, a manufacturer of covered buttons and belts to the garment industry. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST At the present time, there is a possible direct conflict of interest with our sole officer and director as he is a vice president of Jenlis, Inc., initially anticipated to be the primary supplier to PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC. We do not anticipate any problems from this relationship as Jenlis, Inc already sells on a wholesale basis to other business enterprises, both internet sales and "brick and mortar" retailers. The only conflict that we foresee is Mr. Sanders' devotion of time to projects that do not involve us. In the event that Mr. Sanders ceases devoting time to our operations, he has agreed to resign as an officer and director. 25 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION SUMMARY OF COMPENSATION We did not pay any salaries in 2007 or 2008. We do not anticipate beginning to pay salaries until we have adequate funds to do so. There are no stock option plans, retirement, pension, or profit sharing plans for the benefit of our officers and director other than as described herein. REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS The following table sets forth the remuneration of our sole director and officer for the period from inception through May 31,2008. CAPACITIES IN WHICH AGGREGATE NAME OF INDIVIDUAL REMUNERATION WAS RECEIVED - ------------------ ----------------------------- Edward Sanders Sole Executive Officer and $0 Director We have no employment agreements with our sole Executive Officer and Director. We will not pay compensation to Directors for attendance at meetings. We will reimburse the Directors for reasonable expenses incurred during the course of their performance. DIRECTOR COMPENSATION Mr. Edward Sanders a member of our Board of Directors is also our executive officer. We do not pay fees to directors for attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors or of committees; however, we may adopt a policy of making such payments in the future. We will reimburse out-of-pocket expenses incurred by directors in attending board and committee meetings. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS We do not have any long-term incentive plans that provide compensation intended to serve as incentive for performance. EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS At this time, PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC has not entered into any employment agreements with our sole officer and director. If there is sufficient cash flow available from our future operations, the company may in the future enter into employment agreements with our sole officer and director, or future key staff members. INDEMNIFICATION Under our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the corporation, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any proceeding, including a lawsuit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in our best interest. We may advance expenses incurred in defending a proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in a proceeding as to which he is to be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorney's fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Florida. 26 Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Florida law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS The following table sets forth, as of the date of this prospectus, the total number of shares owned beneficially by our sole officer and director, and key employees, individually and as a group, and the present owners of 5% or more of our total outstanding shares. The table also reflects what his ownership will be assuming completion of the sale of all shares in this offering. The stockholder listed below has direct ownership of his shares and possesses sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the shares. Number Percentage of Shares of ownership after offering after offering assuming all assuming all Name and address Number of Shares of the shares of the shares Beneficial Ownership (1) Before Offering are sold are sold - ------------------------ ---------------- -------------- -------------- Edward Sanders 6,000,000 8,500,000 71% 9694 Royal Palm Blvd. Coral Springs, FL 33065 All Officers and 6,000,000 8,500,000 71% Directors as a Group (1 person) _________ (1) The person named above may be deemed to be a "parent" and "promoter" of our company, within the meaning of such terms under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by virtue of his direct and indirect stock holdings. Mr. Sanders is the only "promoter" of our company. On November 13, 2007, a total of 6,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to our sole officer and director, all of which are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 of the Rules and Regulations of the SEC promulgated under the Securities Act. Under Rule 144, the shares can be publicly sold, subject to volume restrictions and restrictions on the manner of sale, commencing one year after their acquisition. Under Rule 144, a shareholder can sell up to 1% of total outstanding shares every three months in brokers' transactions. Shares purchased in this offering, which will be immediately resalable, and sales of all of our other shares after applicable restrictions expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price, if any, of our common stock and the shares we are offering. Our sole officer and director will continue to own the majority of our common stock after the offering, regardless of the number of shares sold. Since he will continue control our company after the offering, investors in this offering will be unable to change the course of our operations. Thus, the shares we are offering lack the value normally attributable to voting rights. This could result in a reduction in value of the shares you own because of their ineffective voting power. None of our common stock is subject to outstanding options, warrants, or securities convertible into common stock. 27 The company is hereby registering 2,500,000 of its common shares, in addition to the 6,000,000 shares currently issued and outstanding. The price per share is $0.01 and will remain so unless and until the shares are quoted on the Over-The-Counter (OTC) Bulletin Board or an exchange. The company may sell at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices only after the shares are quoted on either the OTC Bulletin Board or an exchange (please see "Plan of Distribution" below). The 6,000,000 shares currently issued and outstanding were acquired by our sole officer and director on November 13, 2007. We issued a total of 6,000,000 common shares for consideration of $ 6,000, which was accounted for as a purchase of common stock. In the event the company receives payment for the sale of their shares, PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC will receive all of the proceeds from such sales. PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC is bearing all expenses in connection with the registration of the shares of the company. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES COMMON STOCK Our authorized number of shares is one hundred ten million (110,000,000). The authorized common stock is one hundred million (100,000,000) shares with a par value of $.0001 for an aggregate par value of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and ten million shares of preferred stock (10,000,000) with a par value of ($.0001) for an aggregate par value of one thousand dollars ($1,000). o have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available if and when declared by our Board of Directors; o are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs; o do not have preemptive, subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights; o and are entitled to one non-cumulative vote per share on all matters on which stockholders may vote. We refer you to the Bylaws of our Articles of Incorporation and the applicable statutes of the State of Florida for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of our securities. NON-CUMULATIVE VOTING Holders of shares of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares, voting for the election of directors, can elect all of the directors to be elected, if they so choose, and, in that event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any of our directors. After this offering is completed, present stockholders will own approximately 71% of our outstanding shares. 28 CASH DIVIDENDS As of the date of this prospectus, we have not declared or paid any cash dividends to stockholders. The declaration of any future cash dividend will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial position, our general economic conditions, and other pertinent conditions. It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in our business operations. REPORTING After we complete this offering, we will not be required to furnish you with an annual report. Further, we will not voluntarily send you an annual report. We will be required to file reports with the SEC under section 15(d) of the Securities Act. The reports will be filed electronically. The reports we will be required to file are Forms 10-KSB, 10-QSB, and 8-K. You may read copies of any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an Internet site that will contain copies of the reports we file electronically. The address for the Internet site is www.sec.gov. STOCK TRANSFER AGENT We have not engaged the services of a transfer agent at this time. However, within the next twelve months we anticipate doing so. Until such a time a transfer agent is retained, PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC will act as its own transfer agent. STOCK OPTION PLAN The Board of Directors of PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC has not adopted a stock option plan ("Stock Option Plan"). The company has no plans to adopt a stock option plan but may choose to do so in the future. If such a plan is adopted, this plan may be administered by the board or a committee appointed by the board (the "Committee"). The committee would have the power to modify, extend or renew outstanding options and to authorize the grant of new options in substitution therefore, provided that any such action may not, without the written consent of the optionee, impair any rights under any option previously granted. PASHMINADEPOT.COM, INC may develop an incentive based stock option plan for its officers and directors and may reserve up to 10% of its outstanding shares of common stock for that purpose. LITIGATION We are not a party to any pending litigation and none is contemplated or threatened. EXPERTS Our financial statements have been audited for the period ending May 31, 2008 by Moore and Associates, Chartered as set forth in their report included in this prospectus.

(A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of PashminaDepot.com, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) as of May 31, 2008, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows from inception on November 13, 2007 through May 31, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PashminaDepot.com, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) as of May 31, 2008 and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows from inception on November 13, 2007 through May 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred a net loss of $172, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 6. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /S/ MOORE & ASSOCIATES, CHARTERED Moore & Associates Chartered Las Vegas, Nevada June 5, 2008 2675 S.

GENERAL ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS Pashminadepot.com, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) was incorporated on November 13, 2007 under the laws of the State of Florida to develop a website and sell pashmina and other accessories on that website. It has no operations and in accordance with SFAS #7 is considered to be in the development stage. NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRACTICES Accounting Basis - ---------------- These financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Cash and Cash Equivalents - ------------------------- For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less. Earnings (Loss) per Share - ------------------------- The basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the Company's net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the Company's net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of the first of the year for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no diluted shares outstanding. Dividends - --------- The Company has not adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends. No dividends have been paid during the period shown. Income Taxes - ------------ The Company provides for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." SFAS No. 109 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. No provision for income taxes is included in the statement due to its immaterial amount, net of the allowance account, based on the likelihood of the Company to utilize the loss carry-forward F-7 Advertising - ----------- The Company expenses advertising as incurred. The advertising since inception has been $0. Use of Estimates - ---------------- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue and Cost Recognition - ---------------------------- The Company has no current source of revenue; therefore the Company has not yet adopted any policy regarding the recognition of revenue or cost. NOTE 3. INCOME TAXES: The Company provides for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect currently. SFAS No. 109 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the Company's opinion, it is uncertain whether they will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize the net deferred tax asset. Details for the last three years follow: Year Ended May 31, 2008 ------------ Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance Current Taxes Payable 0.00 ------ Income Tax Expense $ 0.00 ====== The Company has filed no income tax returns since inception. NOTE 4. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY On November 13, 2007, the company received $6,000 contributed capital from its founder. On November 13, 2007, the Company issued 6,000,000 of its $0.0001 par value common stock for $6,000 cash, $0.001 per share, to the founder of the Company. F-8 The company has authorized 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock at $.0001 par value. As of May 31, 2008, zero preferred shares are issued and outstanding. NOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The sole officer and director of the Company is involved in other business activities and may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities that become available. He may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and other business interests. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts. NOTE 6. GOING CONCERN The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the period November 13, 2007 (date of inception) through May 31, 2008 the Company has had a net loss of $172. As of May 31, 2008, the Company has not emerged from the development stage. In view of these matters, recoverability of any asset amounts shown in the accompanying financial statements is dependent upon the Company's ability to begin operations and to achieve a level of profitability. Since inception, the Company has financed its activities principally from the sale of equity securities. The Company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from loans and the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. NOTE 7. THE EFFECT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Below is a listing of the most recent accounting standards and their effect on the Company. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN No. 48"), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes--an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The Interpretation provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under FIN No. 48, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN No. 48 was effective July 1, 2007. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-2, "Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43." EITF Issue No. 06-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. EITF Issue No. 06-2 was effective July 1, 2007. F-9 Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Current Year Misstatements. SAB No. 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet (iron curtain) and an income statement (rollover) approach to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, and provides for a one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. This statement is effective May 1, 2008. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective July 1, 2008, although early adoption is permitted. The FASB has replaced SFAS No. 141 with a new statement on Business Combinations that changes the way that minority interest is recorded and modified as a parent's interest in a subsidiary changes. The adoption of these new Statements is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's current financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. F-10 PART II. INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN THE PROSPECTUS OTHER EXPENSES OF ISSUANCE AND DISTRIBUTION The registrant will pay for all expenses incurred by this offering.

Include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act; ii. Reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information in the registration statement. iii.

(5) For determining any liability under the Securities Act, treat each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus as a new registration statement for the securities offered in the registration statement, and that offering of the securities at that time as the initial bona fide offering of those securities. (6) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised by the Securities and Exchange Commission that such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
