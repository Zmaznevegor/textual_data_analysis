PROSPECTUS SUMMARY About Us We operate, control and beneficially own the pharmaceutical businesses in China of Lotus East under the terms of the Contractual Arrangements. Other than the Contractual Arrangements with Lotus East, we do not have any business or operations. Pursuant to the Contractual Arrangements we provide business consulting and other general business operation services to Lotus East. Through these Contractual Arrangements, we have the ability to control the daily operations and financial affairs of Lotus East, appoint each of their senior executives and approve all matters requiring stockholder approval. As a result of these Contractual Arrangements, which enable us to control Lotus East, we are considered the primary beneficiary of Lotus East. Accordingly, we consolidate Lotus Easts results, assets and liabilities in our financial statements. The creditors of Lotus East, however, do not have recourse to any assets we may have. PRC law currently places certain limitations on foreign ownership of Chinese companies. To comply with these foreign ownership restrictions, we operate our business in China through the Contractual Arrangements with Lotus East. The contractual relationship among the above companies as follows: Notwithstanding that Lotus, Liang Fang and En Zhe Jia are separate legal entities and the legal obligations of the parties are governed by the Contractual Arrangements, there is commonality of control between Lotus and Lotus East as set forth in the following table: 3 Name Executive Officer/Director of Lotus Principal Stockholder of Lotus Stockholder of Liang Fang Stockholder of En Zhe Jia Dr. Liu Zhong Yi √ √ √ √ Mrs. Song Zhenghong (1) √ √ √ √ Wen Li Xian √ (1) Mrs. Song Zhenghong is the spouse of Dr. Liu Zhong Yi. Based in Beijing, China, Lotus East is engaged in the production, trade and retailing of pharmaceuticals, focusing on the development of innovative medicines and investing in strategic growth to address various medical needs. Lotus East owns and operates 10 drug stores throughout Beijing, China that sell Western and traditional Chinese medications, lease medical treatment facilities to licensed physicians, and generate revenues from the leasing of retail space to third party vendors and the leasing of advertising locations at its retail stores. Our principal executive offices are located at 16 Cheng Zhuang Road, Feng Tai District, Beijing 100071 China and our telephone number is 86-10-63899868. Our fiscal year end is December 31. ABOUT THE OFFERING On February 25, 2008, we entered into a Convertible Redeemable Preferred Share and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the Securities Purchase Agreement) whereby we sold 5,747,118 shares of our Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock to 18 accredited investors and issued those purchasers five year common stock purchase warrants to purchase 2,873,553 shares of our common stock in a private offering resulting in gross proceeds to us of $5,000,000. The terms of this offering are described in greater detail later in this prospectus under Managements Discussion and Analysis and Plan of Operations - Recent Capital Raising Transaction beginning on page 34. This prospectus covers the resale of a total of 8,620,671 shares of our common stock by selling security holders which includes 5,747,118 shares that are issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock and 2,873,553 shares that are issuable upon the exercise of warrants. Selling security holders may resell their shares from time-to-time, including through broker-dealers, at prevailing market prices. We will not receive any proceeds from the resale of our shares by the selling security holders. To the extent the warrants are exercised on a cash basis, we will receive the exercise price of the warrants. We will pay all of the fees and expenses associated with registration of the shares covered by this prospectus.

Outstanding After this Offering : 48,122,986 shares of common stock, assuming the conversion of all outstanding Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock into an aggregate of 5,747,118 shares of common stock, but giving no effect to the exercise of the warrants. 4 TOTAL DOLLAR VALUE OF SHARES INCLUDED IN THIS PROSPECTUS UNDERLYING SERIES A CONVERTIBLE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK This prospectus includes the resale of 5,747,118 shares of common stock underlying shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. The Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock is presently convertible into shares of our common stock on a one for one basis. The closing price of our common stock as reported on the OTC Bulletin Board on February 25, 2008, which was the date we entered into the agreement to sell the securities, was $0.81. The total dollar value of the common stock underlying the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock that are being registered for resale is approximately $4,655,166 based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the sale of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. DOLLAR AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS TO SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS The table below sets forth disclosure of the dollar amount of each payment (including the value of any payments to be made in shares of our common stock) in connection with the sale of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock that we have made or will make to:  each selling security holder,  any affiliate of a selling security holder, or  any person with whom any selling security holder has a contractual relationship regarding the sale of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. The amounts include liquidated damages, payments made to finders or placement agents and any other potential payments.

On the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement the market price of our common stock as reported on the OTC Bulletin Board was $0.80. Accordingly, the warrant holders did not realize any possible profit as a result of any discount on the value of the underlying shares of common stock at the time of the transaction. POSSIBLE PROFIT TO THE WARRANT HOLDERS Under the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement with the selling security holders we issued the investors common stock purchase warrants to purchase a total of 2,873,553 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.20 per share. On the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement the market price of our common stock as reported on the OTC Bulletin Board was $1.00. Accordingly, the warrant holders did not realize any possible profit as a result of any conversion discount for the warrants held by the selling security holders at the time of the transaction. COMPARISON OF NET PROCEEDS TO US AND TOTAL POSSIBLE PROFIT TO SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS Gross proceeds to us $ 5,000,000 Less reimbursement of legal fees: (68,568 ) Less placement agent fees (400,000 ) Less interest during first year 0 Net proceeds to us $ 4,531,432 Combined total possible profit of selling security holders 0 Approximate percentage of the net proceeds received by us to the (i) total of all possible payments to the selling security holders ($0) and (ii) total possible discount to the market price of the shares underlying the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock ($0). 100 % The foregoing table gives no effect to the receipt of any proceeds upon the possible exercise of the warrants on a cash basis. PRIOR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS WITH THE SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS Longview Fund, LP, a selling security holder, was an investor in the sale of our 14% convertible secured notes in February 2007 and participated upon the same terms and conditions as the other investors. Under this offering, Longview Fund, LP purchased $2,750,000 principal amount note and we issued it common stock purchase warrants to purchase 1,375,000 shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of $1.50 per share. During the period from February 12, 2007 to February 25, 2008 (the date of repayment of the remaining principal balance and any unpaid interest), we paid Longview Fund LP quarterly interest payments aggregating $391,044. On February 25, 2008 we satisfied the note in full. We used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock to satisfy the note due Longview Fund, LP. Other than the foregoing, we have not been a party to any prior securities transaction with any selling security holder, an affiliate of any selling security holder, or any person with whom any selling security holder has a contractual relationship, including any predecessors of any of those persons, regarding any prior securities transaction. 6 RELATIONSHIP OF OUTSTANDING SHARES BEFORE AND AFTER SALE OF SERIES A CONVERTIBLE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK The table below sets forth disclosure about our common stock held by the selling security holders, our affiliates and affiliates of the selling security holders.

You should not invest in our common stock unless you can afford to lose your entire investment. You should consider carefully the following risk factors and other information in this prospectus before deciding to invest in our common stock. RISKS RELATING TO OVERALL BUSINESS OPERATIONS THE SERIES A CONVERTIBLE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK HAS A MANDATORY CONVERSION AND WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS AVAILABLE TO PAY THE REDEMPTION AMOUNTS. Under the designations, rights and preferences of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock at the option of the holder for a period of 90 days beginning on February 25, 2010. The redemption price which is equal to $0.87 per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, must be paid in cash, in one lump sum within one month from the end of the 90 day period. Assuming that sufficient funds are available to us to pay these redemption amounts, if one or more of the holders of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock should elect redemption of those shares, the payment of the redemption price will materially and adversely impact our liquidity. In addition, as described elsewhere herein, we are dependent on Lotus East to both pay our management fees on a current basis and to repay the amounts we have advanced that company. If for any reason those amounts should not have been tendered and one or more of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock holders should request redemption, it is possible we would not have sufficient funds to pay the redemption amounts. IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH PRC LAWS LIMITING FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF CHINESE COMPANIES, WE CONDUCT OUR PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS THROUGH LOTUS EAST BY MEANS OF THE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OPERATIONS OTHER THAN PURSUANT TO THE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH LOTUS EAST. THE TERM OF THOSE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS IS ONLY FOR 10 YEARS AND THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THOSE AGREEMENTS WILL BE RENEWED. IF THE PRC GOVERNMENT DETERMINES THAT THE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE REGULATIONS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND WE COULD BE FORCED TO CEASE OPERATIONS. 8 The PRC government restricts foreign investment in pharmaceutical businesses in China. Lotus East holds the licenses and approvals necessary to operate its pharmaceutical business in China and through the Contractual Arrangements with Lotus East and its stockholders we substantially control Lotus East. Neither Lotus nor Lotus International, however, are engaged in any business or operations other than pursuant to the terms of the various Contractual Arrangements with Lotus East as described elsewhere in this prospectus. As such, we are completely dependent on the Contractual Arrangements. We do not generate any revenues and have no assets. All of Lotus Easts assets and operations are located in the PRC. As described in the financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus, the assets and liabilities at each of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the results of operations for 2007 and 2006 are those of Lotus East. We cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce these contracts. If we are unable to enforce any legal rights we may have under these contracts or otherwise, our ability to continue as a going concern is in jeopardy. In addition, the terms of these contracts expire in September 2016 and there are no assurances these agreements will be renewed. If the Contractual Arrangements are not renewed or are significantly modified, unless we have expanded our business and operations, of which there are no assurances, we will in all likelihood be forced to cease our operations. The Contractual Arrangements are also subject to enforcement under the laws of the PRC. Although we believe we comply with current PRC regulations, we cannot assure you that the PRC government would agree that these operating arrangements comply with PRC licensing, registration or other regulatory requirements, with existing policies or with requirements or policies that may be adopted in the future. If the PRC government determines that we do not comply with applicable law, it could revoke Lotus Easts business and operating licenses, require us to discontinue or restrict our operations, restrict our right to collect revenues, require us to restructure our operations, impose additional conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply, impose restrictions on our business operations or on our customers, or take other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business. OUR CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH LOTUS EAST AND THEIR RESPECTIVE STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT BE AS EFFECTIVE IN PROVIDING CONTROL OVER THESE ENTITIES AS DIRECT OWNERSHIP. We have no equity ownership interest in Lotus East and rely on the Contractual Arrangements to control and operate such businesses. These Contractual Arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over Lotus East as direct ownership. For example, Lotus East could fail to take actions required for our businesses despite its contractual obligation to do so. If Lotus East fails to perform under the agreements with us, we may have to rely on legal remedies under PRC law, which may not be effective. In addition, we cannot assure you that the Lotus East stockholders would always act in our best interests. CERTAIN OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS ARE ALSO OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS OF LOTUS EAST. WE ARE NOT RECEIVING THE BENEFIT OF CERTAIN TERMS OF THE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN OBLIGATIONS TO OUR COMPANY AND OBLIGATIONS LOTUS EAST WILL BE RESOLVED IN OUR FAVOR. 9 While pursuant to the Contractual Arrangements we have the ability to control the daily operations and financial affairs of Lotus East, appoint each of their senior executives and approve all matters requiring approval by their respective members, these actions on our behalf are determined by our Board of Directors. Dr. Lui, our CEO, and his wife Mrs. Zhenghong, are members of our Board of Directors and principal stockholders of our company and they are also officers, directors and principal stockholders of Lotus East. Conflicts of interests between their duties to our company and Lotus East may arise. Dr. Lui and Mrs. Zhenghong each have a duty of loyalty and care to us under Nevada law when there are any potential conflicts of interests between our company and Lotus East. We cannot assure you, however, that when conflicts of interest arise, Dr. Liu and or Mrs. Zhenghong will act completely in our interests or that conflicts of interests will be resolved in our favor. In addition, Dr. Liu and/or Mrs. Zhenghong could violate their legal duties by diverting business opportunities from us to others. In addition, while the terms of the Contractual Arrangements provide that we are to be paid quarterly service fees equal to the net profit of Lotus East, such payments have not been tendered to us and those funds are being retained by Lotus East to fund their operations. At December 31, 2007 approximately $9 million is due to us by Lotus East which remains unpaid as of the date hereof. Although we have no business and operations other than pursuant to the terms of the Contractual Arrangements, we incur operating expenses related to our public company reporting requirements including legal and accounting fees. There are no assurances that these fees will be paid, or that any other conflicts of interest which may arise between our company and Lotus East related to their obligation to pay the amounts due us will be resolved in our favor. WE HAVE LENT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE NET PROCEEDS FROM OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED FINANCINGS TO LOTUS EAST ON AN INTEREST FREE, UNSECURED BASIS. IF THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT REPAID, OR IF LOTUS EAST DOES NOT BEGIN PAYING THEIR QUARTERLY SERVICE FEES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO PAY OUR OPERATING EXPENSES WHICH COULD RESULT IN A REMOVAL OF OUR COMMON STOCK FROM QUOTATION ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD. In 2007, we sold $3,000,000 principal amount 14% secured convertible notes in a private placement and we lent approximately $2 million of those proceeds to Lotus East for working capital. In 2008, we received net proceeds from the sale of shares of our Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock of approximately $4.6 million. We used approximately $2,576,557 of those proceeds to repay in full all of our outstanding obligations under our 14% secured convertible notes. Of the remaining proceeds, we lent approximately $1,600,000 to Lotus East. These loans are in the form of an unsecured, interest free advances for use by Lotus East in their operations including in their research and development activities. We do not have an understanding with Lotus East regarding the repayment of the amounts advanced to that company. If these funds are not repaid, we may not have sufficient capital to pay our operating expenses which could result in our inability to remain current in our reporting obligations under Federal securities laws. If we were unable to remain current in those requirements, our common stock would be removed from quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board and our stockholders would in all likelihood lose their entire investment in our company. IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN THE ADEQUACY OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS, OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE ACCURATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 COULD BE IMPAIRED, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECREASE SUBSTANTIALLY. 10 We have committed limited personnel and resources to the development of the external reporting and compliance obligations that would be required of a public company. Recently, we have taken measures to address and improve our financial reporting and compliance capabilities and we are in the process of instituting changes to satisfy our obligations in connection with joining a public company, when and as such requirements become applicable to us. Prior to taking these measures, we did not believe we had the resources and capabilities to do so. We plan to obtain additional financial and accounting resources to support and enhance our ability to meet the requirements of being a public company. We will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures, and documentation thereof. If our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems or procedures fail, we may not be able to provide accurate financial statements on a timely basis or comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as it applies to us. Any failure of our internal controls or our ability to provide accurate financial statements could cause the trading price of our common stock to decrease substantially. RISKS RELATED TO LOTUS EASTS OPERATIONS LOTUS EASTS SUCCESS DEPENDS ON COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS, LICENSEES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES OVER WHOM IT HAS LIMITED CONTROL. Due to the complexity of the process of developing pharmaceuticals, Lotus Easts core business depends on arrangements with pharmaceutical institutes, corporate and academic collaborators, licensors, licensees and others for the research, development, clinical testing, technology rights, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of its products. It has one research collaboration and outsources other business functions. Its license agreements could obligate it to diligently bring potential products to market, make milestone payments and royalties that, in some instances, could be substantial, and incur the costs of filing and prosecuting patent applications. There are no assurances that Lotus East will be able to establish or maintain collaborations that are important to its business on favorable terms, or at all. A number of risks arise from its dependence on collaborative agreements with third parties. Product development and commercialization efforts could be adversely affected if any collaborative partner:  terminates or suspends its agreement with Lotus East;  causes delays;  fails to timely develop or manufacture in adequate quantities a substance needed in order to conduct clinical trials;  fails to adequately perform clinical trials;  determines not to develop, manufacture or commercialize a product to which it has rights; or  otherwise fails to meet its contractual obligations. Lotus Easts collaborative partners could pursue other technologies or develop alternative products that could compete with the products it is developing. THE PROFITABILITY OF LOTUS EASTS PRODUCTS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON ITS ABILITY TO PROTECT PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND OPERATE WITHOUT INFRINGING THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. 11 The profitability of Lotus Easts products will depend in part on its ability to obtain and maintain manufacturing rights and preserve trade secrets, and the period its intellectual property remains protected. Lotus East must also operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and without third parties circumventing its rights. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, including Lotus East, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are largely unresolved. The biotechnology patent situation outside the U.S. is uncertain, is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries, and may not protect Lotus Easts intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Because patent applications are maintained in secrecy in some cases, Lotus East cannot be certain that it or its licensors are the first creators of inventions described in our pending patent applications or patents or the first to file patent applications for such inventions. Most of Lotus Easts drug products have been approved by the PRCs Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) but have not received patent protection. For instance, Valsartan, one of Lotus Easts most profitable products, is produced by other companies in China, including Novartis. If Novartis or any other company were to obtain patent protection for Valsartan in China, or for any of Lotus Easts other drug products, it would have a material adverse effect on its revenue. Other companies may independently develop similar products and design around any patented products Lotus East develops. We cannot assure you that:  any of Lotus Easts patent applications will result in the issuance of patents;  Lotus East will develop patentable products;  the manufacturing rights Lotus East has been issued will provide it with any competitive advantages;  the patents of others will not impede Lotus Easts ability to do business; or  third parties will not be able to circumvent Lotus Easts manufacturing rights. There are no assurances that Lotus East will be able to meaningfully protect its trade secrets. We cannot assure you that any of Lotus Easts existing confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, advisors or collaborators will provide meaningful protection for its trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure. Collaborators, advisors or consultants may dispute the ownership of proprietary rights to Lotus Easts products, for example by asserting that they developed the product independently. LOTUS EAST MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN MANUFACTURING ITS PRODUCTS. Before Lotus Easts products can be profitable, they must be produced in commercial quantities in a cost-effective manufacturing process that complies with regulatory requirements, including GMP, production and quality control regulations. If Lotus East cannot arrange for or maintain commercial-scale manufacturing on acceptable terms, or if there are delays or difficulties in the manufacturing process, it may not be able to conduct clinical trials, obtain regulatory approval or meet demand for its products. Production of Lotus Easts products could require raw materials which are scarce or which can be obtained only from a limited number of sources. If Lotus East is unable to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials, the development, regulatory approval and marketing of its products could be delayed. LOTUS EAST COULD NEED MORE CLINICAL TRIALS OR TAKE MORE TIME TO COMPLETE ITS CLINICAL TRIALS THAN WE HAVE PLANNED. 12 Clinical trials vary in design by factors including dosage, end points, length, and controls. Lotus East may need to conduct a series of trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of its products. The results of these trials may not demonstrate safety or efficacy sufficiently for regulatory authorities to approve Lotus Easts products. Further, the actual schedules for its clinical trials could vary dramatically from the forecasted schedules due to factors including changes in trial design, conflicts with the schedules of participating clinicians and clinical institutions, and changes affecting product supplies for clinical trials. Lotus East relies on collaborators, including academic institutions, governmental agencies and clinical research organizations, to conduct, supervise, monitor and design some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our products. Since these trials depend on governmental participation and funding, Lotus East has less control over their timing and design than trials it sponsors. Delays in or failure to commence or complete any planned clinical trials could delay the ultimate timelines for Lotus East product releases. LOTUS EAST MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE REGULATORY APPROVALS OR CLEARANCES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO COMMERCIALIZE ITS PRODUCTS. The PRC imposes significant statutory and regulatory obligations upon the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products. It typically has a lengthy approval process in which it examines pre-clinical and clinical data and the facilities in which the product is manufactured. Regulatory submissions must meet complex criteria to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the ultimate products. Addressing these criteria requires considerable data collection, verification and analysis. Lotus East may spend time and money preparing regulatory submissions or applications without assurances as to whether they will be approved on a timely basis or at all. Lotus Easts product candidates, some of which are currently in the early stages of development, will require significant additional development and pre-clinical and clinical testing prior to their commercialization. These steps and the process of obtaining required approvals and clearances can be costly and time-consuming. If Lotus Easts potential products are not successfully developed, cannot be proven to be safe and effective through clinical trials, or do not receive applicable regulatory approvals and clearances, or if there are delays in the process:  the commercialization of Lotus Easts products could be adversely affected;  any competitive advantages of the products could be diminished; and  revenues or collaborative milestones from the products could be reduced or delayed. Governmental and regulatory authorities may approve a product candidate for fewer indications or narrower circumstances than requested or may condition approval on the performance of post-marketing studies for a product candidate. Even if a product receives regulatory approval and clearance, it may later exhibit adverse side effects that limit or prevent its widespread use or that force Lotus East to withdraw the product from the market. Any marketed product and its manufacturer will continue to be subject to strict regulation after approval. Results of post-marketing programs may limit or expand the further marketing of products. Unforeseen problems with an approved product or any violation of regulations could result in restrictions on the product, including its withdrawal from the market and possible civil actions. 13 In manufacturing Lotus Easts products it is required to comply with applicable good manufacturing practices regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the maintenance of records and documentation. If Lotus East cannot comply with regulatory requirements, including applicable good manufacturing practice requirements, it may not be allowed to develop or market the product candidates. If Lotus Eat fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process, it may be subject to sanctions, including fines, product recalls or seizures, injunctions, refusal of regulatory agencies to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approve applications, total or partial suspension of production, civil penalties, withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications and criminal prosecution. COMPETITORS MAY DEVELOP AND MARKET PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS THAT ARE LESS EXPENSIVE, MORE EFFECTIVE OR SAFER, MAKING LOTUS EASTS PRODUCTS OBSOLETE OR UNCOMPETITIVE. Some of Lotus Easts competitors and potential competitors have greater product development capabilities and financial, scientific, marketing and human resources than it does. Technological competition from pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies is intense and is expected to increase. Other companies have developed technologies that could be the basis for competitive products. Some of these products have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing the desired curative effect than products Lotus East is developing. Alternative products may be developed that are more effective, work faster and are less costly than its products. Competitors may succeed in developing products earlier than Lotus East, obtaining approvals and clearances for such products more rapidly than it, or developing products that are more effective than those of Lotus East. In addition, other forms of treatment may be competitive with its products. Over time, Lotus Easts products may become obsolete or uncompetitive. LOTUS EASTS OPERATIONS AND THE USE OF ITS PRODUCTS COULD SUBJECT IT TO DAMAGES RELATING TO INJURIES OR ACCIDENTAL CONTAMINATION. Lotus Easts research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials. It is subject to central government, provincial and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of such materials and waste products. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from handling and disposing of such materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident involving hazardous materials, Lotus East could be held liable for resulting damages. Lotus East is not insured with respect to this liability. Such liability could exceed its resources. IF LOTUS EAST WERE SUCCESSFULLY SUED FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY, IT COULD FACE SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES THAT MAY EXCEED ITS RESOURCES. Lotus East may be held liable if any product it develops, or any product which causes injury or is found unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing, sale or use. These risks are inherent in the development of pharmaceutical products. Lotus East does not have product liability insurance. If Lotus East choose to obtain product liability insurance but cannot obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, the commercialization of products that it develops may be prevented or inhibited. If it is sued for any injury caused by its products, Lotus Easts liability could exceed its total assets. 14 LOTUS EAST HAS LIMITED BUSINESS INSURANCE COVERAGE. The insurance industry in China is still at an early stage of development. Insurance companies in China offer limited business insurance products. Lotus East does not have any business liability or disruption insurance coverage for its operations in China. Any business disruption, litigation or natural disaster may result in our incurring substantial costs and the diversion of its resources. LOTUS EASTS SUCCESS DEPENDS ON ATTRACTING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. Lotus East depends on a core management and scientific team. Although most of these personnel are founders and stockholders of Lotus East, there can be no assurance that it can be successful in retaining them. The unavailability or departure of such key personnel may seriously disrupt and harm its operations, business and the implementation of its business strategy and plans. Lotus Easts future success depends in large part on its continued ability to attract and retain other highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing and government regulation. It faces competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. If Lotus Easts recruitment and retention efforts are unsuccessful, its business operations could suffer. RISKS RELATED TO DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA BOTH OUR COMPANY AND LOTUS EAST MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY COMPLEXITY, UNCERTAINTIES AND CHANGES IN PRC REGULATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS AND COMPANIES, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO OWN KEY ASSETS. The PRC government regulates the pharmaceutical industry including foreign ownership of, and the licensing and permit requirements pertaining to, companies in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws and regulations are relatively new and evolving, and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainty. As a result, in certain circumstances it may be difficult to determine what actions or omissions may be deemed to be a violation of applicable laws and regulations. Issues, risks and uncertainties relating to PRC government regulation of the pharmaceutical industry include the following:  we only have contractual control over Lotus East. We do not own it due to the restriction of foreign investment in Chinese businesses; and  uncertainties relating to the regulation of the pharmaceutical business in China, including evolving licensing practices, means that permits, licenses or operations at our company may be subject to challenge. This may disrupt Lotus Easts business, or subject it to sanctions, requirements to increase capital or other conditions or enforcement, or compromise enforceability of related contractual arrangements, or have other harmful effects on it. The interpretation and application of existing PRC laws, regulations and policies and possible new laws, regulations or policies have created substantial uncertainties regarding the legality of existing and future foreign investments in, and the businesses and activities of, pharmaceutical businesses in China, including our business. ADVERSE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL POLICIES OF THE PRC GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE OVERALL ECONOMIC GROWTH OF CHINA, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT LOTUS EASTS BUSINESS. 15 All of Lotus Easts business operations are conducted in China. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects are subject to a significant degree to economic, political and legal developments in China. Chinas economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including with respect to:  the amount of government involvement,  level of development,  growth rate,  control of foreign exchange, and  allocation of resources. While the PRC economy has experienced significant growth in the past 20 years, growth has been uneven across different regions and among various economic sectors of China. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall PRC economy, but may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to Lotus East. Since early 2004, the PRC government has implemented certain measures to control the pace of economic growth. Such measures may cause a decrease in the level of economic activity in China, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. IF PRC LAW WERE TO PHASE OUT THE PREFERENTIAL TAX BENEFITS CURRENTLY BEING EXTENDED TO FOREIGN INVESTED ENTERPRISES AND NEW OR HIGH-TECHNOLOGY ENTERPRISES LOCATED IN A HIGH-TECH ZONE, LOTUS EAST WOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE TAXES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL AND ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Under PRC laws and regulations, a foreign invested enterprise may enjoy preferential tax benefits if it is registered in a high-tech zone and also qualifies as new or high-technology enterprise. As a foreign invested enterprise as well as a certified new or high-technology enterprise located in a high-tech zone in Beijing: Lotus East is registered in the Liangxiang Economic Tech Development Zone and is entitled to an exemption from enterprise income tax Until December 12, 2008. If the PRC law were to phase out preferential tax benefits currently granted to new or high-technology enterprises and technology consulting services, we would be subject to the standard statutory tax rate, which currently is 33%, and we would be unable to obtain business tax refunds for our provision of technology consulting services. Loss of these preferential tax treatments could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. UNCERTAINTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE PRC LEGAL SYSTEM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US. We conduct our business through the Contractual Arrangements with Lotus East. Our operations in China are governed by PRC laws and regulations. We are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. 16 Since 1979, PRC legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. In particular, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published decisions and their nonbinding nature, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until some time after the violation. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. YOU MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES IN EFFECTING SERVICE OF LEGAL PROCESS, ENFORCING FOREIGN JUDGMENTS OR BRINGING ORIGINAL ACTIONS IN CHINA BASED ON UNITED STATES OR OTHER FOREIGN LAWS AGAINST US OR OUR MANAGEMENT. All of Lotus Easts assets are located outside the United States and all of its current operations are conducted in China. Moreover, the majority of our directors and officers are nationals or residents of China. All or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for our stockholders to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of China would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or such officers and/or directors predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities law of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in China against us or such persons predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OF CURRENCY CONVERSION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPANY. The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Lotus East receives all of its revenues in RMB. Under our current structure, our income is restricted to payments under the Contractual Arrangements with Lotus East. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of Lotus East to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay the monthly fees due us, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated obligations. As such, we may not be able to receive all amounts due to us from Lotus East under the Contractual Arrangements. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents Lotus East from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy its currency demands, we may not have sufficient funds available to pay our obligations as they become due.. 17 FLUCTUATION IN THE VALUE OF RMB MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOUR INVESTMENT. The value of RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. All of Lotus Easts financial assets and its revenues and costs are denominated in RMB. We rely entirely on fees paid to us by Lotus East. Any significant fluctuation in value of RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, earnings and financial position, and the value of the consulting fees payable to us by Lotus East. For example, an appreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar would make any new RMB denominated investments or expenditures more costly to Lotus East, to the extent that it might need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for such purposes. An appreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar would also result in foreign currency translation losses for financial reporting purposes when we translate our U.S. dollar denominated financial assets into RMB, as RMB is our reporting currency. WE FACE RISKS RELATED TO HEALTH EPIDEMICS AND OTHER OUTBREAKS. Lotus Easts business could be adversely affected by the effects of SARS or another epidemic or outbreak. China reported a number of cases of SARS in April 2004. Any prolonged recurrence of SARS or other adverse public health developments in China may have a material adverse effect on Lotus Easts business operations. For instance, health or other government regulations adopted in response may require temporary closure of Lotus Easts production facilities or of its offices. Such closures would severely disrupt its business operations and adversely affect our results of operations. Lotus East has not adopted any written preventive measures or contingency plans to combat any future outbreak of SARS or any other epidemic. RISKS RELATED TO HOLDING OUR SECURITIES OUR CORPORATE ACTIONS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY CONTROLLED BY OUR MANAGEMENT. Our executive officers and directors own approximately 61% of our outstanding common stock and approximately 54% of voting control. These stockholders, acting individually or as a group, could exert substantial influence over matters such as electing directors and approving mergers or other business combination transactions. In addition, because of the percentage of ownership and voting concentration in these principal stockholders, elections of our board of directors will generally be within the control of these stockholders. It would be difficult for our stockholders to propose and have approved proposals not supported by management. There can be no assurances that matters voted upon by our officers and directors in their capacity as stockholders will be viewed favorably by all stockholders of our company. THE ELIMINATION OF MONETARY LIABILITY AGAINST OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS UNDER NEVADA LAW AND THE EXISTENCE OF INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS TO OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES BY US MAY DISCOURAGE LAWSUITS AGAINST OUR DIRECTORS AND/OR OFFICERS. Our articles of incorporation do not contain any specific provisions that eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to our company and stockholders, however we are prepared to give such indemnification to our directors and officers to the extent provided by Nevada law. These indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit our company and stockholders. 18 WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ESTABLISHING ADEQUATE MANAGEMENT, LEGAL AND FINANCIAL CONTROLS IN THE PRC. PRC companies have historically not adopted a Western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which includes strong corporate governance, internal controls and, database, financial and other control systems. As a result, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards. Therefore, we may, in turn, experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure on our part may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls which could impact the reliability of our financial statements which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. THE EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING WARRANTS, THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AS INTEREST ON THE OUTSTANDING NOTES AND THE POSSIBLE CONVERSION OF THOSE OUTSTANDING NOTES WILL BE DILUTIVE TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. At April 24, 2008 we had 42,375,868 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and the following securities which are convertible or exercisable into shares of our common stock were outstanding:  5,747,118 shares of our common stock issuable upon the possible conversion of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock;  up to an additional 919,540 shares of our common stock which we may issue the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stockholders as dividend payments; and  4,623,553 of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of common stock purchase warrants with exercise prices ranging from $0.87 to $1.50 per share. The issuance of the shares as dividend payment, the exercise of the warrants and/or the conversion of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock and will have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. CERTAIN OF OUR OUTSTANDING WARRANTS CONTAIN CASHLESS EXERCISE PROVISIONS WHICH MEANS WE WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY CASH PROCEEDS UPON THEIR EXERCISE. In February 2007 and February 2008, we issued five year common stock purchase warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4,373,553 shares of our common stock with current exercise prices of $1.20 per share in connection with the sales of our 14% secured convertible notes and the shares of our Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. All of these warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis at any time when there is not an effective registration statement covering the shares of our common stock underlying the warrants which means that the holders, rather than paying the exercise price in cash, may surrender a number of warrants equal to the exercise price of the warrants being exercised. The utilization of this cashless exercise feature will deprive us of additional capital which might otherwise be obtained if the warrants did not contain a cashless feature. 19 WE HAVE NOT VOLUNTARILY IMPLEMENTED VARIOUS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MEASURES, IN THE ABSENCE OF WHICH, STOCKHOLDERS MAY HAVE MORE LIMITED PROTECTIONS AGAINST INTERESTED DIRECTOR TRANSACTIONS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND SIMILAR MATTERS. Recent Federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address board of directors independence, audit committee oversight, and the adoption of a code of ethics. While we have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we have not adopted any of these other corporate governance measures such as an audit or other independent committees of our board of directors and, since our securities are not yet listed on a national securities exchange, we were not required to do so. If we expand our board membership in future periods to include additional independent directors, we may seek to establish an audit and other committees of our board of directors. It is possible that if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, stockholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. For example, in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees may be made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions. WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL RISKS RELATING TO OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND OUR ABILITY TO HAVE THOSE CONTROLS ATTESTED TO BY OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS. As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules which require that for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2008 the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements must attest to and report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as well as the operating effectiveness of our internal controls. While there is presently pending a proposal for a one year delay which, if approved, could extend the compliance period to our fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, regardless of the effective date in the event we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors with respect to our internal controls, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and our ability to obtain financing as needed could suffer. BECAUSE OUR STOCK CURRENTLY TRADES BELOW $5.00 PER SHARE, AND IS QUOTED ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD, OUR STOCK IS CONSIDERED A PENNY STOCK WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS LIQUIDITY. As the trading price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share, our common stock is considered a penny stock, and trading in our common stock is subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under this rule, broker/dealers who recommend low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special sales practice requirements. The broker/dealer must make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written consent prior to the transaction. 20 SEC regulations also require additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a penny stock, including the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and its associated risks. These requirements severely limit the liquidity of securities in the secondary market because few broker or dealers are likely to undertake these compliance activities. In addition to the applicability of the penny stock rules, other risks associated with trading in penny stocks could also be price fluctuations and the lack of a liquid market. IF THE SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS ALL ELECT TO SELL THEIR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THE SAME TIME, THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR SHARES MAY DECREASE. It is possible that the selling security holders will offer all of the shares for sale. Further, because it is possible that a significant number of shares could be sold at the same time hereunder, the sales, or the possibility thereof, may have a depressive effect on the market price of our common stock.

Payment of dividends will be within the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to the limitations in the designations, rights and preferences of our Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, and will depend, among other factors, upon our earnings, capital requirements and our operating and financial condition. At the present time, our anticipated financial capital requirements are such that we intend to follow a policy of retaining earnings in order to finance the development of our business. Pursuant to the designations, rights and preferences of our Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock each share pays a mandatory dividend at an annual rate of 8.00%, compounded annually, of the sum of:  $0.87 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares), plus  an amount equal to any dividend that has accumulated through such date on a share of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock has not paid in full that are payable in respect of such share, whether or not such dividends are declared. 22 Dividend payments are to be made in additional shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock on February 25 of each year. The terms of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock prohibit us from declaring or paying dividends on our common stock as long as the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock is outstanding.

Any proceeds that we receive from the exercise of the outstanding warrants, if exercised on a cash basis, will be used by us for general working capital. The actual allocation of proceeds realized from the exercise of the warrants will depend upon the amount and timing of such exercises, our operating revenues and cash position at such time and our working capital requirements. There can be no assurances that any of the outstanding warrants will be exercised on a cash basis, if at all. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION Overview Prior to September 6, 2006, we operated as a retailer of jewelry, framed art and home accessories. On September 28, 2006, we closed the Share Exchange Agreement with Lotus International whereby we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Lotus International in exchange for newly-issued shares of our common stock. As a result Lotus International became our wholly-owned subsidiary and Lotus Internationals stockholders owned the majority of our voting stock. The acquisition of Lotus International by us was accounted for as a reverse merger because on a post-merger basis, the former stockholders of Lotus International held a majority of our outstanding common stock on a voting and fully-diluted basis. As a result, Lotus International is deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes. 23 Additionally, on September 6, 2006, Lotus International entered into the Contractual Arrangements with Lotus East whereby the stockholders of Lotus East transferred all operating, voting and control to Lotus. The acquisition of the Lotus International by Lotus is accounted for as a reverse merger because on a post-merger basis, the former stockholders of Lotus International held a majority of the outstanding common stock of Lotus on a voting and fully-diluted basis. As a result of the Contractual Arrangements, Lotus East was deemed to be the acquirer of Lotus International for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the financial statement data presented herein are those of Lotus East for all periods prior to our acquisition of Lotus International on September 28, 2006, and the financial statements of the consolidated companies from the acquisition date forward. Neither Lotus nor Lotus International are engaged in any business or operations other than pursuant to the terms of the various Contractual Arrangements with Lotus East as described elsewhere in this report. As such, we are completely dependent on the Contractual Arrangements. We do not generate any revenues and have no assets. Pursuant to the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46R Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R), under generally accepted accounting principles Lotus East which are deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs) we are required to consolidate the financial statements of Lotus East with our financial statements. Accordingly, and as described elsewhere in this report, the assets and liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the results of operations for 2007 and 2006 are those of Lotus East. All of those assets and operations are located in the PRC and the Contractual Arrangements are subject to enforcement under the laws of the PRC. If we are unable to enforce any legal rights we may have under these contracts or otherwise, our ability to continue as a going concern is in jeopardy. In addition, the terms of these contracts expire in September 2016 and there are no assurances these agreements will be renewed. If the Contractual Arrangements are not renewed or are significantly modified, unless we have expanded our business and operations, of which there are no assurances, we will in all likelihood be forced to cease our operations. When used in this section, and except as may be set forth otherwise, the terms we, us, ours, and similar terms includes Lotus and its subsidiary Lotus International as well as Lotus East. Results of Operations - For 2007 Versus 2006 Total Revenues Total revenues for 2007 were $56,873,115 as compared to $36,207,689 for 2006, an increase of $20,665,426 or approximately 57%. For 2007 and 2006, net revenues consisted of the following: 2007 2006 Wholesale $ 41,651,106 $ 25,430,069 Retail 3,471,960 3,532,623 Other revenues 11,750,049 7,244,997 Total revenues $ 56,873,115 $ 36,207,689 24  For 2007, wholesale revenues increased by $16,221,037 or approximately 64%. The significant increase in tangible product revenues is mainly attributed to continued strong sales of our best selling product, VALSARTAN Capsules, a medicine for primary hypertension or high blood pressure. Additionally, we start various distributing third party manufactured pharmaceutical products through our existing sale network. Furthermore, a significant increase in wholesale revenues is attributed to the reversal of a sales return allowance of approximately $2,200,000 originally recorded in 2006, as discussed below.  For 2007, retail revenues decreased by $60,663 or approximately 2%. The slight decrease in retail revenue was due to decreased sales in traditional Chinese medicine through our retail channel. As part of our strategic plan, we gradually reduced our Chinese medicine inventory level in 2007 as the quality of traditional Chinese medicine stored at our retail location is more difficult to control. A portion of our Chinese medicine inventory was sold at a lower price as part of the inventory reduction effort.  For 2007, other revenues increased by $4,505,052, or approximately 62%. The significant increase in other revenues is attributed to the following: 2007 2006 Leasing revenues $ 859,288 $ 696,637 Third-party manufacturing 9,482,572 4,855,402 Advertising revenues 601,335 571,293 Research and development and lab testing services 806,854 1,121,665 Total other revenues $ 11,750,049 $ 7,244,997  During 2007, we subleased more of our counter spaces to third parties and increased the lease amount at certain sublease locations. As a result , our leasing revenue increased in 2007 as compared to 2006.  During 2007, the number of our third party contract manufacturing projects have increased significantly. In connection with third-party manufacturing, the customer supplies the raw materials and we are paid a fee for manufacturing their product. As a result of increased third party contract manufacturing projects in 2007, our third-party manufacturing revenues increased by $4,627,170 or approximately 95%.  Our revenue from the advertisement contract whereby we receive approximately $50,000 per month for the lease of counter and other space at our retail locations remained materially consistent in 2007. We expect this revenue to increase in the future as we sign similar contracts.  In each of 2007 and 2006, we performed research and development and lab testing projects for various third parties and performed drug testing and analysis. The number of research and development and lab testing projects decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006, our revenue from research and development and lab testing services decreased accordingly. 25 Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes raw materials, packing materials, shipping, and manufacturing costs, which includes allocated portion of overhead expenses such as utilities and depreciation directly related to product production. For 2007, cost of sales amounted to $33,678,963, or approximately 59.2% of total net revenues, as compared to $26,129,687 or approximately 72.2% of total revenues for 2006. The decrease in costs of sales as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to a 54% increase in third-party manufacturing revenues. We do not incur raw material costs in connection with the manufacture of third party products and receive a higher gross profit margin. Additionally, in 2007, we reduced our reserve for obsolete inventory by approximately $247,000 and accordingly, reduced our cost of sales by $247,000. Gross Profit Gross profit for 2007 was $23,194,152, reflecting an overall margin of approximately 40.8% as compared to $10,078,002 or approximately 27.8% for 2006. The increase in gross profit margin is attributable to decrease in cost of sales as percentage of total net revenue. Although we recognized higher than average gross profits during 2007, there could be no assurances that we will continue to recognize similar gross profit margin in the future. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for 2007 were $11,885,859, an increase of $6,276,701, or approximately 112%, from 2006. This increase included the following:  Selling expenses. For 2007, selling expenses amounted to $6,460,206 as compared to $3,030,421 for 2006, an increase of $3,429,785 or approximately 113%. This increase is attributable to a $615,000 increase in sales commissions and bonuses provided to our sales managers and representatives as incentives. Additionally, we contracted an advertisement and planning company in Beijing for approximately $2 million to promote our products and brand name recognition. We expect our selling expenses will continue to increase as our revenues increase and expect to spend increased funds on adverting and promotion of our products as well as sales training.  Research and development. For 2007, research and development costs amounted to $2,411,651 as compared to $387,337 for 2006, an increase of $2,024,314. This increase is primarily attributable to the research and development agreements Lotus East entered into in 2007 with third parties for the design, research and development of designated pharmaceutical projects for Lotus East. As part of the agreements, Lotus East paid approximately $3,200,000 (RMB 24,000,000) to these parties and recognized $2,411,651 as expense during 2007.  General and administrative. For 2007, general and administrative expenses were $3,014,002 as compared to $2,191,400 for 2006, an increase of $822,602, or approximately 38% as summarized below: 26 2007 2006 Salaries and related benefits $ 1,457,501 $ 1,012,438 Amortization 140,471 183,613 Depreciation 10,550 22,102 Rent 242,856 206,965 Travel and entertainment 284,357 164,804 Professional fees 250,472 105,081 Other 627,795 496,397 Total $ 3,014,002 $ 2,191,400 The changes in these expenses from 2007 as compared to 2006 included the following:  Salaries and related benefits increased $445,063 or 44% primarily due the increase in compensation of executive officers and directors and the increased use of our part time employees,  Amortization of our manufacturing rights decreased by $ 43,142 or 24% primarily due to a decrease in Valsartan manufacturing right, which was fully amortized in 2006, of approximately $95,000 and partially offset by an increase in amortization of revenue rights of approximately $44,000,  Depreciation decreased by $11,552 or approximately 52.3% primarily due to certain office fixed assets were fully depreciated in 2006,  Rent increased by $35,891 or approximately 17.3% primarily due to an unfavorable change in currency exchange rate,  Travel and entertainment expenses increased by $119,553 or 73% due to increased sales-related travel,  Professional fees increased by $145,391 or 138% due to an increase in accounting and legal fees related to our reporting obligations under Federal securities laws, and  Other selling, general and administrative expenses, which includes utilities, office supplies and expenses increased by $131,398 or 27% primarily due to increase in office expenses as well as increase in the cost of directors and officers insurance. Income from Operations We reported income from operations of $11,308,293 for 2007 as compared to income from operations of $4,468,844 for 2006, an increase of $6,839,449 or approximately 153%. This increase is attributable to our higher net revenues in 2007 and greater gross profit margin which was offset by increased operating expenses. 27 Total Other Income (Expense) For 2007, total other income excluding interest expense amounted to $1,947,570 as compared to $0 for 2006, an increase of $1,947,570. This change is primarily attributable to a one-time gain of $2,160,795 from the forgiveness of income and value added taxes and $102,154 of interest income from our cash deposits which was offset by one-time debt issuance costs of $205,379 and a one-time registration rights penalty of $110,000, both associated with the issuance of 14% secured convertible notes in a financing transaction in 2007. Interest expense increased $2,038,735 in fiscal 2007 from 2006. Included in 2007 interest expense is $1,458,484 of a non-cash expense for the amortization of debt discount related to these secured convertible notes, as well as $370,417 of interest associated with those notes which were satisfied in February 2008. Interest expense in 2007 also included $209,834 of interest paid to related parties on loans made to Lotus East as compared to $325,824 paid in 2006. Net Income, Other Comprehensive Income and Comprehensive Income As a result of these factors, we reported net income of $11,217,128 for 2007 as compared to $4,143,020 for 2006. In 2007 we reported an unrealized gain on foreign currency translation of $1,480,352, an increase of $1,152,784, or approximately 352%, from 2006. We report in U.S. dollars, but the functional currency of Lotus East is the RMB. Translation adjustments result from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars, with the average translation rates applied to our income statement of 7.6172 RMB to $1.00 in 2007. As a result of this non-cash gain, we reported comprehensive income of $12,697,480, or basic net income per common share of $0.27, for 2007 as compared to $4,470,588, or basic net income per common share of $0.10 for 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2007, we had a cash balance of $4,557,957. Substantially all of this cash is deposited in financial institutions in China. Our working capital position increased $16,236,314 to $24,652,137 at December 31, 2007 from $8,415,823 at December 31, 2006. This increase in working capital is primarily attributable to increases of approximately $2.47 million in cash, approximately $13.1 million in accounts receivable and approximately $757,000 in prepaid expenses as well as reductions of approximately $1.475 million in value-added and service taxes payable and approximately $602,000 due to related parties offset a decrease of approximately $196,000 in advances from customers and an increase of approximately $2.6 million on convertible debt, net. 28 The increase in accounts receivable at December 31, 2007 reflects our increased sales during 2007. At December 31, 2007, we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable balances of $548,083 as compared to $539,627 at December 31, 2006 and reflects our best estimate of probable losses. In determining the allowance for doubtful accounts, our management reviews our accounts receivable aging as well as the facts and circumstances of specific customers who may indicate the collection of specific amounts are at risk. As is customary in the PRC, we extend relatively long payment terms to our customers. Our terms of sale generally require payment within four months to a year, which is considerably longer than customary terms offered in the United States, however, we believe that our terms of sale are customary amongst our competitors for a company our size within our industry. We also occasionally offer established customers longer payment terms on new products as an incentive to purchase these products, which has served to further increase the average days outstanding for accounts receivable. As the market for these new products is established, we will discontinue offering this sales incentive. Occasionally we will request a customer to prepay an order prior to shipment. At December 31, 2007 our balance sheet reflected advances from customers of $34,531 as compared to $231,340, a decrease of $196,809, or approximately 85%, from December 31, 2006 due to product delivery timing difference. At December 31, 2007, our inventories of raw materials and finished goods totaled $3,410,739, an increase of approximately 9% from December 31, 2006. Our inventory levels may vary based upon our production schedule and the timing of shipments. We expect to maintain higher inventory levels to accommodate for anticipated future sales growth as well as a wider variety of products. From time to time we have obtained either working capital advances from our executive officers or loans from these officers, employees and other related parties. The following table provides comparative balances at December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2006: December 31, 2007 2006 Difference Due from related party $ 0 $ 1,826,626 $ (1,826,626 ) Due to related parties - current liabilities $ 323,178 $ 925,484 $ (602,306 ) Due to related parties - long term liabilities $ 738,300 $ 863,447 $ (125,147 ) Notes payable - related parties $ 4,738,508 $ 4,729,880 $ 8,628 At December 31, 2006, an entity owned by our CEO owed us $1,826,626 for funds lent to this entity. During 2007, this related party repaid approximately $1,061,000 of these advances and on December 31, 2007, our CEO agreed to offset the remaining balance due under a note payable to related party in the amount of approximately $814,000 which represented funds which had been advanced to us from time to time for working capital. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, due to related parties - current and long term reflected amounts due for working capital advances made to us as well as a portion of the assignment of the fee payable under the agreement with our CEO, Mr. Liu, related to Wu Lan Cha Bu Emergency Hospital. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions appearing later in this prospectus. During 2007 we paid $680,797 of these advances and recorded interest of $58,774 on those working capital advances. During 2007, we also paid $194,709 of the assignment fees payable. Additional changes in due to related party balances is attributable to foreign currency translations. Notes payable - related parties reflect balances due various related parties for long-term notes. During 2007, interest expense related to these notes was $209,834. 29 Net cash used in operating activities for 2007 was $850,455 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $4,834,642 for 2006. For 2007, net cash used in operating activities was attributable primarily to our net income of $11,217,128, a decrease in advances from customers of $204,267 and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $27,266 and unearned revenue of $71,402 together with a reduction in valued-added and service taxes payable of $608,526, which was offset by cash used to fund an increase in accounts receivable of $9,746,076, inventories of $58,942, prepaid and other current assets of $714,013 and non-cash items totaling $2,033,479. For the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by operating activities was attributable primarily to our net income of $4,143,020, the add back of depreciation and amortization of $581,564, a decrease in inventory balance of $3,928,236, an increase in taxes payable of $1,999,675, and an increase in other liabilities of $446,660 offset by a net increase in accounts receivable of $6,189,358 (net of increases in allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $2,732,889) and prepaid expenses of $75,155. Net cash provided by investing activities for 2007 was $679,237 as compared to $1,242,262 for 2006. In 2007, we purchased factory equipment for $381,772 as compared to $1,480 spent in 2006 and, in 2007 we collected amounts due to us by a related party of $1,061,009 as compared to $1,243,742 collected in 2006. Net cash provided by financing activities was $2,411,093 for 2007 and reflects proceeds of $3,459,351 from issuance of debt net of repayments of related party advances and debt issuance costs of $1,048,258. Net cash used in financing activities was $4,193,487 for 2006 and was attributable to payments on related party advances and loans. We reported a net increase in cash for 2007 of $2,239,875 for 2007 as compared to $1,928,222 for 2006. In 2007, we lent approximately $2 million of the net proceeds received from the sale of $3 million principal amount convertible debt to Lotus East, which they used as working capital. These advances are unsecured and interest free. In 2008, we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of equity to satisfy these notes, lent Lotus East an additional $1.6 million and retained the balance to fund our operating expenses. We have no operations other than the Contractual Arrangements with Lotus East and, accordingly, we are dependent upon the quarterly service fees due us to provide cash to pay our operating expenses. Such payments have not been tendered to us and those funds are being retained by Lotus East to fund their operations. At December 31, 2007 Lotus East owned us approximately $9 million for such fees and we do not know when such funds will be paid to us. Our CEO is also the CEO and principal shareholder of Lotus East. Accordingly, we are solely reliant upon his judgment to ensure that the funds advanced to Lotus East are repaid to us. If these funds should not be repaid, or if Lotus East should continue to withhold payment of the quarterly service fee due us under the Contractual Arrangement, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds to pay our operating expenses in future periods. Other than our existing cash we presently have no other alternative source of working capital. We currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures but believe that our working capital is sufficient to fund our current operations for approximately the next 12 months. Lotus East has historically funded its capital expenditures from their working capital and have advised us that they believe this capital is sufficient for their current needs. However, the ability of Lotus East to raise any significant capital to expand their operations is very limited. We believe that it is in our best long term interests to assist Lotus East in their growth plans. Accordingly, it is likely that we will seek to raise working capital to fund the expansion of its production line, upgrade of its manufacturing facilities and technologies, expand its retail operations, and fund research and development projects as well as providing working capital necessary for its ongoing operations and obligations. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in obtaining additional capital, or that such capital will be available in terms acceptable to our company. 30 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses, fair valuation of stock related to stock-based compensation and income taxes. We based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition Product sales . Product sales are generally recognized when title to the product has transferred to customers in accordance with the terms of the sale. We recognize revenue in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101,  Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements  as amended by SAB No. 104 (together, SAB 104), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 48  Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists.  SAB 104 states that revenue should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned. In general, we record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. SFAS No. 48 states that revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product shall be recognized at the time of sale only if the sellers price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale, the buyer has paid the seller, or the buyer is obligated to pay the seller and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product, the buyers obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product, the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller, the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer, and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated. We recognize revenue for the sale of pharmaceutical products and for payments received, if any, under reimbursement of development costs as follows: Product Sales . Revenue from product sales, net of estimated provisions, is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably probable. Our customers consist of pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel, hospitals, and retail customers. Provisions for sales discounts, and estimates for chargebacks, and product returns are established as a reduction of product sales revenue at the time revenues are recognized, based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact these reserves. Factors include current contract prices and terms, estimated wholesaler inventory levels, remaining shelf life of product, and historical information for similar products in the same distribution channel. These revenue reductions are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance, or as an addition to accrued expenses if the payment is due to a party other than the customer. 31 Product returns . We account for sales returns in accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to its estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned. We determine the estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns, but also by considering other factors that could impact sales returns. These factors include levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product discontinuances, and price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products. In general, for wholesale sales, we provide credit for product returns that are returned six months prior to and up to six months after the product expiration date. Upon sale, we estimate an allowance for future product returns. We provide additional reserves for contemporaneous events that were not known and knowable at the time of shipment. In order to reasonably estimate future returns, we analyzed both quantitative and qualitative information including, but not limited to, actual return rates, the level of product manufactured by us, the level of product in the distribution channel, expected shelf life of the product, current and projected product demand, the introduction of new or generic products that may erode current demand, and general economic and industry wide indicators. We also utilize the guidance provided in SAB 104 in establishing our return estimates. Other revenues . Other revenues consist of (i) rental income received for the lease of retail space to various retail merchants; (ii) advertising revenues from the lease of counter space at our retail locations; (iii) rental income from the lease of retail space to licensed medical practitioners; and (iv) revenues received by us for research and development projects. We recognize revenues upon performance of such funded research. We recognize revenues from leasing of space as earned from contracting third parties. Revenues received in advance are reflected as deferred revenue on the accompanying balance sheets. Additionally, we receive income from the sale of developed drug formulas. Income from the sale of drug formulas are recognized upon performance of all of our obligations under the respective sales contract and are included in other income on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis. Management judgment and estimates are made in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts. Specifically, we analyze the aging of accounts receivable balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms. Significant changes in customer concentration or payment terms, deterioration of customer credit-worthiness or weakening in economic trends could have a significant impact on the collectability of receivables and our operating results. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The reserve for bad debts increased to $548,083 at December 31, 2007, up from $539,627 at December 31, 2006. This increase is due to the increasing level of sales revenue and its corresponding exposure. At December 31, 2007, accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns, amounted to $20,430,827. 32 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the weighted-average method. Inventory consists of finished capsules, liquids, finished oral suspension powder and other western and traditional Chinese medicines and medical equipment. At least on a quarterly basis, we review our inventory levels and write down inventory that has become obsolete or has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value or is in excess of expected requirements. Inventory levels are evaluated by management relative to product demand, remaining shelf life, future marketing plans and other factors, and reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventories are recorded for amounts which may not be realizable. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, we examine the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property and equipment are as follows: Buildings and leasehold improvement 20 to 40 years Manufacturing equipment 10 to 15 years Office equipment and furniture 5 to 8 years Income Taxes Taxes are calculated in accordance with taxation principles currently effective in the United States and PRC. We account for income taxes using the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which provides guidance for how companies should measure fair value when required to use a fair value measurement for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP). SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. 33 In December 2006, FASB Staff Position No. EITF 00-19-2, Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements, was issued. The FSP specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement, whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement, should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We believe that our current accounting is consistent with the FSP. Accordingly, adoption of the FSP had no effect on our financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, under which entities will now be permitted to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS 157. The adoption of SFAS 159 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Accounting and Reporting of Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). These two standards must be adopted in conjunction with each other on a prospective basis. The most significant changes to business combination accounting pursuant to SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 are the following: (a) recognize, with certain exceptions, 100 percent of the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in acquisitions of less than a 100 percent controlling interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity, (b) acquirers shares issued in consideration for a business combination will be measured at fair value on the closing date, not the announcement date, (c) recognize contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair values, with subsequent changes in fair value generally reflected in earnings, (d) the expensing of all transaction costs as incurred and most restructuring costs, (e) recognition of pre-acquisition loss and gain contingencies at their acquisition date fair values, with certain exceptions, (f) capitalization of acquired in-process research and development rather than expense recognition, (g) earn-out arrangements may be required to be re-measured at fair value and (h) recognize changes that result from a business combination transaction in an acquirers existing income tax valuation allowances and tax uncertainty accruals as adjustments to income tax expense. We anticipate these new standards will significantly affect our accounting for future business combinations following adoption on January 1, 2009. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-- an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133  (FAS 161). FAS 161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The guidance in FAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. This Statement encourages, but does not require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. We are currently assessing the impact of FAS 161. 34 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of the date of this prospectus, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors, however we have agreed to guarantee loans for Lotus East, if required. As of the date of this report, we have not entered into any guarantee arrangements with Lotus East. The term off-balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have: (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets. Certain Effects of Product Returns on our Financial Statements As described elsewhere herein, our return policy typically allows product returns for products within a 12 month window from six months prior to the expiration date and up to six months after the expiration date of a product. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned pursuant to our return policy, and record a related reserve at the time of sale which is reflected on our balance sheet as a deduction from accounts receivable. The amount of these reserves is deducted from our gross sales to determine our net revenues for the period. The amount of actual product returns could be either higher or lower than the amounts we accrued and any changes in our estimates are recorded in the income statement, as either an increase or decrease in our gross sales to determine our net revenues for the period, in the period of the change. If we over or under estimate the quantity of product which will ultimately be returned, there may be a material impact to our financial statements. Historically, approximately 65% of our total revenues consist of sales of four principal products and product returns from these principal products, as well as our other products, have been immaterial. Accordingly, based upon our experience we historically do not record a reserve at the time of sale and there have been no accounting entries related to our product return policy which have reduced our gross revenues or had any material impact on our financial statements During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, however, we sold approximately $2,300,000 of products which were either less popular products or products that were nearing their expiration dates to existing customers at reduced prices in a one-time transaction. The customers had the right to return these products pursuant to our product return policy. Because of the one-time nature of the transaction and the age of the products sold, we did not believe that the customary assumptions which we utilize when determining the amount of reserve to establish for product returns were appropriate as it was more than remotely possible that all or substantially all of the products would be returned by the customer and we would not collect any revenues from this transaction. Accordingly, we believed that it was prudent to fully reserve the amount of the sales and at December 31, 2006, we increased our allowance for sales returns by $2,300,000 which equaled 100% of the amount of revenues recorded in the transaction. This accounting treatment had the effect of reducing our net revenues by $2,300,000 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. However, we recorded cost of sales related to this product of approximately $2,200,000 during the year fiscal 2006, which had the effect of increasing our cost of sales during the year by that amount, and correspondingly reducing our gross profit and income from operations. Based on managements estimate, during 2006 we wrote off inventory that we deemed obsolete. 35 During the year ended December 31, 2007 we collected substantially all of the amounts billed to these customers for the product. Accordingly, we reduced our allowance for sales returns at during 2007 by approximately $2,200,000 recorded as a reserve at December 31, 2006. The collection of this receivable had the effect of increasing our net revenues during 2007 by $2,200,000, even through the sales of these products were actually made during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Because we recorded the costs associated with these products in our cost of sales during fiscal 2006, both our gross profit margin and income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $2,200,000. Recent Capital Raising Transaction On February 25, 2008, we entered into a Convertible Redeemable Preferred Share and Warrant Purchase Agreement by and among our company, Dr. Liu Zhong Yi and Mrs. Song Zhenghong, and certain accredited investors pursuant to which we sold the purchasers 5,747,118 shares of our Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 2,873,553 shares of our common stock in a private placement pursuant to Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, for the aggregate purchase price of $5 million. Net proceeds, exclusive of expenses of placement, were $4.6 million after we paid fees of $400,000 to Maxim Group, LLC, our placement agent for the offering. We used approximately $2,576,557 of the net proceeds to repay in full all of our outstanding obligations under our 14% secured convertible notes due February 2008. We lent $1.6 million to Lotus East to fund its operations and we are using the remainder of the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. A description of the designations, rights and preferences of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock as well as a description of the terms of the warrants can be found later in this prospectus under Description of Securities. We agreed to undertake to file a registration statement within 60 days following the closing date in order to register the maximum number of common stock issuable from conversion or exercise of the shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock and warrants sold in the offering that is allowable under applicable federal securities regulations. This prospectus is a part of that registration statement. We are also obligated to have the registration statement declared effective within 120 days following the closing date. Otherwise, we are subject to liquidated damages, equal to 1% of the total conversion price and exercise price for the common stock being registered under the registration statement, for every 30-day period following the date that the registration statement should have been effective, prorated for any period less than 30 days, until either all of common shares registered under the registration statement have been sold or all such common shares may be sold in any three month period pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, whichever is earlier. We must also pay the liquidated damages up to a maximum of $500,000 if sales cannot be made pursuant to the registration statement for any reason excepting market conditions. In connection with the purchase agreement, Dr. Liu and Mrs. Zhenghong entered into an escrow agreement with the purchasers and delivered in the aggregate 7,500,000 shares of our common stock owned by them to an escrow account. Approximately 2,083,334 of the escrowed shares are being held in escrow subject to our meeting certain earning targets as set forth below:  the target for 2007 was $8.5 million in net income which was achieved,  the target for 2008 is 95% of $13.8 million in net income after eliminating the effect of non-cash charges associated with the offering and adjusting for differences in the exchange rate between RMB and US dollars used in our financial statements, and 36  the target for 2009 is 95% of $17.5 million in net income after eliminating the effect of non-cash charges associated with offering and adjusting for differences in the exchange rate between RMB and US dollars used in our financial statements . So long as the shares remain in escrow pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement, Dr. Liu and Mrs. Hong retain voting control over the securities. The escrow shares will be transferred to the purchasers if we do not meet the earning targets, and released back to stockholders if we do. Approximately 416,666 of the escrowed shares is being held in escrow subject to our listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market within 18 months following the closing date. These escrowed shares will be transferred to the purchasers if the listing is not completed within that time period, and released back to the stockholders if it is. Finally, 5,000,000 of the escrowed shares are held in escrow to ensure that the purchasers receive their full redemption payments if they choose to redeem their shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. If a purchaser receives less than the full redemption amount for each preferred share being redeemed, the purchaser will receive a number of escrowed shares to make up the difference, based on the then-current market price of the common shares. Following the end of the redemption period, these escrowed shares, less those transferred to any purchasers that redeemed their shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, will be released back to the stockholders. OUR BUSINESS Overview We operate, control and beneficially own the pharmaceutical businesses in China of Lotus East under the terms of the Contractual Arrangements.

Accordingly, we consolidate Lotus Easts results, assets and liabilities in our financial statements. The creditors of Lotus East, however, do not have recourse to any assets we may have. PRC law currently places certain limitations on foreign ownership of Chinese companies. To comply with these foreign ownership restrictions, we operate our business in China through the Contractual Arrangements with Lotus East. The contractual relationship among the above companies as follows: 37 Notwithstanding that Lotus, Liang Fang and En Zhe Jia are separate legal entities and the legal obligations of the parties are governed by the Contractual Arrangements, there is commonality of control between Lotus and Lotus East as set forth in the following table: Name Executive Officer/Director of Lotus Principal Stockholder of Lotus Stockholder of Liang Fang Stockholder of En Zhe Jia Dr. Liu Zhong Yi √ √ √ √ Mrs. Song Zhenghong (1) √ √ √ √ Wen Li Xian √ (1) Mrs. Song Zhenghong is the spouse of Dr. Liu Zhong Yi.

Lotus East Based in Beijing, China, Liang Fang is engaged in the production, trade and retailing of pharmaceuticals, focusing on the development of innovative medicines and investing in strategic growth to address various medical needs. Liang Fang owns and operates 10 drug stores throughout Beijing, China that sell Western and traditional Chinese medications, lease medical treatment facilities to licensed physicians, and generate revenues from the leasing of retail space to third party vendors and the leasing of advertising locations at its retail stores. En Zhe Jia is the sole manufacturer for Liang Fang and maintains facilities for the production of medicines, patented Chinese medicine, as well as the research and production of other new medicines. Lotus Easts business is composed of three parts:  manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products, including the manufacture of pharmaceutical products for other distributors (OEM manufacturing), 39  retailing of Western and traditional Chinese medications, and medical treatment equipment through retail locations; and  research and development as outlined below: Manufacturing and Distribution of Pharmaceutical Products Lotus Easts production enterprise is located in the Chaoyang District of Beijing and covers a floor space of approximately 50,000 square feet. It possesses liquid phase, gas phase, spectrum, and mass spectrum equipment and a variety of types of purification and distilling equipment, all of which can be used for production and research and development of biochemical medicines, Chinese traditional medicines, chemical compound medicines, antibiotics and other new medicines. As one of the first enterprises to be authenticated by the National China Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Lotus East believes it has an advanced automatic pharmacy product line which is GMP authenticated under certificate numbers C0849, C0850, D1645, and G3452. Medicines produced by Lotus East include:  material medicine,  troches,  capsules,  granule medicaments;  freeze-dried powder for injections,  injections of small capacities, and  eye drops. Different production control zones are used with separated air conditioning system according to different production and control needs. Production and sale of its pharmaceuticals and wholesale distribution of third party manufactured pharmaceuticals is Lotus Easts largest and most profitable business and accounts for approximately 73% of our net revenues in 2007. Under various manufacturing contracts, Lotus East provides contract manufacturing services for several drug companies including the manufacture of product to their specifications. Currently, Lotus East markets and sells its products only in PRC. Lotus Easts principal pharmaceutical manufactured products include: Valsartan In 2000, Lotus East obtained approval from the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of China to sell Valsartan as a raw material and as a capsule (Maixin). Among its best selling products, Valsartan is a drug that treats hypertension or high blood pressure. This product is globally recognized as the ideal anti-high blood pressure medication by the medical industry due to its most stable and longest lasting treatment results and minimum side-effects. High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled. Valsartan works by blocking a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, Valsartan relaxes blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. Lotus Easts goal is to make Valsartan the number one prescribed brand in its class of high blood pressure medications in the PRC. 40 Through October 2006, Lotus East held manufacturing rights to produce Valsartan. It estimates that there are currently 10 enterprises producing single regent dosage and fixed-dose combinations of Valsartan in China. The foreign pharmacy Novartis Pharma sells Valsartan under its brand name, Diovan. According to clinical verification, the two products, Maixin and Diovan, have the same clinical effects. Lotus East believes that the longer its product is on the market, its market share will increase year by year due to brand recognition and continued sales efforts. Lotus East also believes that even if the Chinese government does not take any measures to protect these products, other enterprises still can not replicate its products before February 2009 because it takes at least 28 months to replicate any orally taken medicine. By then, even if the market has fiercer competition, Lotus East believes its market will be relatively mature and that its production cost will be lower than those new products. Accordingly, it believes that its sales revenue from Valsartan can stay relatively stable. Brimonidine Tartrate Eyes Drops Brimonidine Tartrate is a drug used to constrict adrenaline receptors, an important step in treating glaucoma. Lotus East sells Brimonidine Tartrate eye drops under its brand name Muxin. The drug was first put into market in the U.S. in 1998 and in August 2004, Lotus East received the rights to manufacture and release the drug in the Chinese market. A fast and obvious curative effect, very few side effects, a very high exponent of cure and high endurement are prime features of the drug. It will produce no harmful effects of reducing blood pressure, resulting in calmness and so on, much like diazepam. The imported product of its kind is Alphagan and is produced by Allergan (Hangzhou) Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. According to clinical experiments of Peoples Hospital of Peking University and Tianjin Eye Hospital, Muxin and imported Alphagan have exactly the same curative effect but the side-effects of Muxin are fewer than Alphagan. As a result, Lotus East believes that its product has a stronger competitive advantage. Lotus East holds manufacturing rights to produce Brimonidine Tartrate through August 2009. Lotus East estimates that other enterprises will not be able to replicate this product until March 2010, as it believes it takes at least 30 months to replicate an eye drop medicine. Currently, Lotus East has minimal competition and believes its market share will not decrease. However, it does anticipate lowers profits after 2010. Levofloxacin Lactate for Injection Levofloxacin is a popular anti-bacterial drug for the treatment of mild, moderate, and severe infections caused by susceptible trains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions such as acute maxillary sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, complicated and uncomplicated urinary tract infections, and acute pyelonephritis. Lotus East received the rights to manufacture and release the drug in the Chinese market in 2005. It currently sells Levofloxacin Lactate for Injection under its brand name Junxin. The imported product of its kind is manufactured by Japanese pharmaceutical company, Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. Levofloxacin is one of most widely use antibiotics in China and Lotus East believes this product will remain competitive through 2011. 41 Nicergoline for Injection Nicergoline for Injection is a national medical insurance product. It is an a-receptor blockage nerve system blood-brain medicine with remarkable curative effect. On the cerebral level, it prompts a lowering of vascular resistance, an increase in arterial flow and stimulates the use of oxygen and glucose. Nicergoline also improves blood circulation in the lungs and limbs and has been shown to inhibit blood platelet aggregation. It is used to treat senile dementia, migraines of vascular origin, transient ischemia, platelet hyper-aggregability and macular degeneration. Lotus East received the rights to manufacture this product in 2006 and release the drug in the Chinese market in 2007. The estimated patient base for this product in China is approximately 30,000,000 people and Lotus East believes this product will remain competitive through 2011. Lotus East also acts as a wholesale distributor to distribute various pharmaceutical products manufactured by third party manufactures. The revenue from wholesale distribution in 2007 was approximately 28% of Lotus Easts wholesale revenue. With the implementation in China of macro-economic policy, the overall profit margin of medicines shall decrease. As of the date of this report, we can not estimate the effect of these economic policies on our results of operations. Retail Drugstores Lotus East owns and operates 10 drug stores throughout many different districts of Beijing, including:  Xin Zhong Tai Drugstore  Long Ren Tang Drugstore  Wan Shou Road Drugstore  He Ping Li Drugstore  Feng Lin Lu Zhou  Youth Lake Drugstore  Capital Airport Drugstore  Young An Zhong Sheng Drugstore  Cheng Zhuang Road Drugstore  Feng Tai Drugstore These 10 drug stores all offer in excess of 5,000 types of Western and traditional Chinese medications, and medical treatment equipment. Lotus East has over 200 employees including registered pharmacists at these drug stores. The drug stores attempt to compete according to lower pricing and more efficient distribution and management practices. Through its retail operations, Lotus East also generates revenue through the leasing of office space to licensed physicians, the lease of store front areas to various merchants, and the lease of advertising space in the retail pharmacies. 42 Distribution Methods and Lotus Easts Customers Currently, Lotus East sells drugs through approximately 70 distribution agents and drug distribution companies in China covering Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing. GuangDong, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Henan, Hubei, LiaoNing, HeiLongjiang, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Hebei, Anhui, Yunnan, Sichuan, Shanxi provinces in the PRC. Lotus East works with various distribution companies to distribute its products. The demand for new drugs in China is substantial as the drug distribution companies suffer from very low profit margins from the distribution of old generic drugs. Additionally, Lotus East has a network of connections with hospitals in the Inner Mongolia and surrounding areas which provide direct access to hospitals in these areas. Lotus Easts drug products are also sold through its retail drug stores. Lotus East recognizes the importance of branding as well as packaging. All of its products bear a uniform brand but it also brands and packages its products with specialized designs to differentiate the different categories of its products. Lotus East conducts promotional marketing activities to publicize and enhance the companys image as well as to reinforce the recognition of its brand name, including:  publishing advertisements and articles in national as well as specialized and provincial newspapers, magazines, and in other media, including the Internet;  participation in national meetings, seminars, symposiums, exhibitions for bio-pharmaceutical and other related industries;  organizing cooperative promotional activities with distributors; and  sending direct mail to major physician offices and laboratories. Excluding customers in its retail operations, Lotus East currently has over 100 customers, including over 30 direct customers in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, GuangDong, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Henan, Hubei, LiaoNing, HeiLongjiang, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Hebei, Anhui, Yunnan, Sichuan, Shanxi provinces in the PRC. In 2007 Lotus East spent approximately $2,600,000 on advertising expenses as compared to approximately $82,000 in 2006. Agreement with Wu Lan Cha Bu Emergency Hospital On October 10, 2006, Lotus East entered into a five-year loan agreement and contract with Wu Lan Cha Bu Emergency Hospital whereby Lotus East agreed to lend to Wu Lan Cha Bu Emergency Hospital approximately $3,840,000 for the construction of a hospital ward in Inner Mongolia, China. In exchange for the loan, Wu Lan Cha Bu Emergency Hospital agreed that Lotus East would be the exclusive provider for all medicines and disposable medical treatment apparatus to it for a period of 20 years. In October 2006, Dr. Liu Zhong Yi, our Chief Executive Officer and the CEO and principal stockholder of Lotus East, loaned these funds to Wu Lan Cha Bu Emergency Hospital on behalf of Lotus East. Accordingly, on October 10, 2006 Lotus East entered into an assignment agreement whereby it assigned all of its rights, obligations, and receipts under the loan agreement to Dr. Liu, except for the rights to revenues from the sale of medical and disposable medical treatment apparatus which will remain with Lotus East. As compensation to Dr. Liu for accepting the assignment under the loan agreement including all of the risks and obligations and for Dr. Liu not accepting the rights to revenues from the sale of medical and disposable medical treatment apparatus which will remain with Lotus East, Lotus East agreed to pay Dr. Liu an aggregate of approximately $1,150,000 to be paid in five equal annual installments of approximately $230,000. The hospital construction project is estimated to be completed by 2009 and it is anticipated that Lotus East will begin generating revenue from the hospital after the completion date. 43 Competition Vertically integrated pharmaceutical operations are still at an early stage of development in China due to heavy state involvement in the past and Lotus East believes that the industry is fragmented. Lotus East faces competition from domestic drug research and development companies and drug manufacturing companies which are growing rapidly. Its direct competitors are domestic pharmaceutical companies and new drug research and development institutes that have fairly strong research and development capabilities in new drugs such as Beijing Venture Biopharma Technology Co., Ltd., Fosun Group Co., Ltd. and Chongqing Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Co. Ltd., Zhuhai Lizhu and Beijing Nohua. Lotus East also faces competition of foreign companies who have strong proprietary pipeline and strong financial resources. These companies have significantly greater assets than Lotus East and have a larger current market share. Lotus East believes its advantage is its local concentration in research and development as well as its local distribution network, and lower prices. Lotus East attempts to focus more on quality, and establishing long-term good cooperative relations with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine and medicine test organizations. Lotus East believes that it is able to compete as a result of its research and development capability, extensive sales network and lower prices. Other than these competitors, most of Lotus Easts other competitors produce only one or two products. Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers Lotus East designs, creates prototypes and manufactures its products at its manufacturing facilities located at Beijing, PRC. Its principal raw materials include Brimonidine Tartrate, Brimonidine Tartrate and Valsartan. The prices for these raw materials are subject to market forces largely beyond Lotus Easts control, including energy costs, organic chemical prices, market demand, and freight costs. The prices for these raw materials have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future. Intellectual property Lotus East relies on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret protection laws in PRC and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and its brand. Lotus East intends to apply for patent protection of certain of its special technologies to protect our core technologies. There are no assurances, however, that if such applications are made that the patents will be granted. Lotus East also enters into confidentiality, non-compete and invention assignment agreements with its employees and consultants and nondisclosure agreements with third parties. Maixing and Liang Fang are its registered trademarks in the PRC. Research and Development Lotus East places great emphasis on product research and development and it has established a research and development center. Lotus Easts research and development team is comprised of nine individuals who are focused on discovering new drugs as well as developing generic and improved drugs based on existing products already on the market and traditional Chinese medicinal products. Lotus East also contracts third party research and development institutes to conduct various research and development projects on its behalf. From research and development performed during and prior to fiscal 2005, Lotus East has a product pipeline containing approximately seven products in different dosage forms which are ready for commercialization in China for the treatment of diseases.

Additionally, Lotus East is also subject to various regulations and permit systems by the Chinese government. The Drug Administration Law of the PRC governs Lotus East and its products. The State Food & Drug Administration of the PRC regulates and implements drug laws. The State FDA has granted Lotus East six government permits for it to produce the following products:  Valsartan Capsules,  the material of Valsartan,  Levofloxacin Lactate for Injection,  the material of Levofloxacin Lactate,  Brimonidine Tartrate Eyes Drops with a density of 0.1, and  Brimonidine Tartrate Eyes Drops with the density of 0.3.

Lotus East has the requisite approval and licenses from the Ministry of Agriculture in order to operate its production facilities. Compliance with Environmental Law Lotus East complies with the Environmental Protection Law of China and its local regulations. In compliance with PRC environmental regulations, Lotus East spent approximately $150,000 in 2006 and approximately $170,000 in 2007 on compliance with environmental regulations, principally for waste discharge processing and dust cleaning. 46 Employees We do not have any employees. As of April 23, 2008 Lotus East has 239 employees, including 199 full time employees and 40 part time employees. All of these employees are all located in the PRC and who receive labor insurance.

The value attributable to any option awards is computed in accordance with FAS 123R.

Code of Ethics We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to provide guiding principles to all of our employees. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics does not cover every issue that may arise, but it sets out basic principles to guide our employees and provides that all of our employees must conduct themselves accordingly and seek to avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. Any employee which violates our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics will be subject to disciplinary action, up to an including termination of his or her employment. Generally, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics provides guidelines regarding:  compliance with laws, rules and regulations,  conflicts of interest,  insider trading,  corporate opportunities,  competition and fair dealing,  discrimination and harassment,  health and safety,  record keeping,  confidentiality,  protection and proper use of company assets,  payments to government personnel, 51  waivers of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics,  reporting any illegal or unethical behavior, and  compliance procedures. In addition, we have also adopted a Code of Ethics for our Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers. In addition to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our CEO and senior financial officers are also subject to specific policies regarding:  disclosures made in our filings with the SEC,  deficiencies in internal controls or fraud involving management or other employees who have a significant role in our financial reporting, disclosure or internal controls,  conflicts of interests, and  knowledge of material violations of securities or other laws, rules or regulations to which we are subject. A copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. Committees of the Board of Directors Our Board of Directors has not established any committees, including an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee or a Nominating Committee, any committee performing a similar function. The functions of those committees are being undertaken by the entire board as a whole. Our board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because it believes the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by our Board of Directors as a whole. Further, we are currently quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, which does not have any qualitative requirements mandating the establishment of any particular committees. We do not have a policy regarding the consideration of any director candidates which may be recommended by our shareholders, including the minimum qualifications for director candidates, nor has our Board of Directors established a process for identifying and evaluating director nominees. We have not adopted a policy regarding the handling of any potential recommendation of director candidates by our shareholders, including the procedures to be followed. Our Board has not considered or adopted any of these policies as we have never received a recommendation from any shareholder for any candidate to serve on our Board of Directors. Given the nature of our operations and lack of directors and officers insurance coverage, we do not anticipate that any of our shareholders will make such a recommendation in the near future. While there have been no nominations of additional directors proposed, in the event such a proposal is made, all members of our Board will participate in the consideration of director nominees. None of our directors is an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of Item 401(e) of Regulation S-B. In general, an audit committee financial expert is an individual member of the audit committee or Board of Directors who:  understands generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements,  is able to assess the general application of such principles in connection with accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves,  has experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements comparable to the breadth and complexity to our financial statements,  understands internal controls over financial reporting, and  understands audit committee functions. 52 Since the closing of the share exchange with Lotus International, we have relied upon the personal relationships of our CEO to attract individuals to our Board of Directors. While we would prefer that one or more of our directors be an audit committee financial expert, the individuals whom we have been able to attract to our Board do not have the requisite professional backgrounds. While the OTC Bulletin Board does not impose any qualitative standards requiring companies to have independent directors or requiring that one or more of its directors be audit committee financial experts, it is our intent to expand our Board of Directors during 2008 to include additional independent directors as well as one or more directors who are considered audit committee financial experts. At that time we intent to establish an Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Executive Compensation Summary Compensation Table The following table summarizes all compensation recorded by us in each of the last two completed fiscal years for our principal executive officer, each other executive officer serving as such whose annual compensation exceeded $100,000 and up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would have been made in this table but for the fact that the individual was not serving as an executive officer of our company at December 31, 2007.

This provision limits our rights and the rights of our stockholders to recover monetary damages against a director for breach of the fiduciary duty of care except in the situations described above. This provision does not limit our rights or the rights of any stockholder to seek injunctive relief or rescission if a director breaches his duty of care. These provisions will not alter the liability of directors under federal securities laws. Our by-laws require us to indemnify directors and officers against, to the fullest extent permitted by law, liabilities which they may incur under the circumstances described above. Our articles of incorporation further provide for the indemnification of any and all persons who serve as our director, officer, employee or agent to the fullest extent permitted under Nevada law. Insofar as the limitation of, or indemnification for, liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing, or otherwise, we have been advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such limitation or indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. 54 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS Dr. Liu leases Lotus East a 249 square meter retail space for no charge on a month-to-month basis. On October 10, 2006, Lotus East entered into a five-year loan agreement and contract with Wu Lan Cha Bu Emergency Hospital whereby Lotus East agreed to lend to Wu Lan Cha Bu Emergency Hospital approximately $3,840,000 for the construction of a hospital ward in Inner Mongolia, China. In exchange for the loan, Wu Lan Cha Bu Emergency Hospital agreed that Lotus East would be the exclusive provider for all medicines and disposable medical treatment apparatus to it for a period of 20 years. In October 2006, Dr. Liu Zhong Yi, our Chief Executive Officer and the CEO and principal stockholder of Lotus East, loaned these funds to Wu Lan Cha Bu Emergency Hospital on behalf of Lotus East. Accordingly, on October 10, 2006 Lotus East entered into an assignment agreement whereby it assigned all of its rights, obligations, and receipts under the loan agreement to Dr. Liu, except for the rights to revenues from the sale of medical and disposable medical treatment apparatus which will remain with Lotus East. As compensation to Dr. Liu for accepting the assignment under the loan agreement including all of the risks and obligations and for Dr. Liu not accepting the rights to revenues from the sale of medical and disposable medical treatment apparatus which will remain with Lotus East, Lotus East agreed to pay Dr. Liu an aggregate of approximately $1,150,000 to be paid in five equal annual installments of approximately $230,000. During 2007 Dr. Liu was paid $ 194,709 under the terms of this agreement. From time to time Lotus East has lent working capital to related parties. At December 31, 2006 we had a receivable of $1,826,626 from an affiliated entity owned by Dr. Liu. During 2007 this related party repaid approximately $1,061,000 of these advances and at December 31, 2007 Dr. Liu agreed to offset the remaining balance due against a note payable to a related party in the amount of $814,000. At December 31, 2007 amounts due from related parties was $0. In 2007, we sold $3,000,000 principal amount 14% secured convertible notes in a private placement and we lent approximately $2 million of those proceeds to Lotus East for working capital. In 2008 we received net proceeds from the sale of shares of our Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock of approximately $4.6 million. We used approximately $2,576,557 of those proceeds to repay in full all of our outstanding obligations under our 14% secured convertible notes. Of the remaining proceeds, we lent approximately $1,600,000 to Lotus East. These loans are in the form of an unsecured, interest free advances for use by Lotus East in their operations including in their research and development activities. We do not have an understanding with Lotus East regarding the repayment of the amounts advanced to that company.

Holders of common stock are entitled to share in all dividends that the Board of Directors, in its discretion, declares from legally available funds. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, subject to the preferences of any shares of preferred stock which may then be authorized and outstanding, each outstanding share entitles its holder to participate in all assets that remain after payment of liabilities and after providing for each class of stock, if any, having preference over the common stock. Holders of common stock have no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights, and there are no redemption provisions for the common stock. The rights of the holders of common stock are subject to any rights that may be fixed for holders of preferred stock, when and if any preferred stock is authorized and issued. All outstanding shares of common stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock Our articles of incorporation authorized the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series with such designations, voting powers, if any, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and such qualifications, limitations and restrictions, as are determined by resolution of our Board of Directors. In February 25, 2008 we designated a series of 10,000,000 shares as Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock and we subsequently sold 5,747,118 shares in the financing transaction described earlier in this prospectus under Managements Discussion and Analysis and Plan of Operations - Recent Capital Raising Transaction. The designations, rights and preferences of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock include: Each of the shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock is convertible into one share of our common stock, subject to proportional adjustment for stock splits, dividends and similar corporate events. Holders of preferred shares may not convert the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock if the conversion would result in the holder beneficially owning more than 4.99% of our outstanding common shares. This limitation may be waived by a holder on not less than 61 days written notice to us. The shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock pay an 8% dividend annually, which is payable annually on February 25 of each year in additional shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock also pay any dividend paid on the common shares on an as converted basis. For a period of 90 days after February 25, 2010, the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the purchasers at the redemption price of $0.87 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like), and no other shares of our capital stock may be redeemed prior to any redemption of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. 57 The holders of the shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock vote with holders of the common stock on an as converted basis, except that the holders of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Shares are not entitled to vote for the election of our directors. We are prohibited from taking certain corporate actions without the approval of the holders of a majority of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding., including:  issuing securities senior to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock,  selling substantially all of our assets,  repurchasing securities, or  declaring or paying dividends. Under the Certificate of Designation, under certain circumstances the purchasers have a preemptive right, from the closing date until the conclusion of a public offering by us, to purchase any equity securities we may offer that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock or its equivalent. Common stock purchase warrants In connection with the sale of our 14% secured convertible notes in February 2007 we issued the purchasers five year common stock purchase warrants to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of our common stock with an initial exercise price of $1.50 per share. The exercise price of these warrants was reduced to $1.20 per share pursuant to its terms as a result of the financing transaction involving our Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. Holders of the warrants may not exercise the warrants if the exercise would result in the holder beneficially owning more than 4.99% of our outstanding common shares. That limitation may be waived by a holder of the warrants on not less than 61 days written notice to us. In connection with the sale of shares of our Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock in February 2008 we issued the purchasers five year common stock purchase warrants to purchase up to 2,873,553 shares of our common stock with an initial exercise price of $1.20 per share, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the warrants. Holders of the warrants may not exercise the warrants if the exercise would result in the holder beneficially owning more than 4.99% of our outstanding common shares. That limitation may be waived by a holder of the warrants on not less than 61 days written notice to us. With respect to both series of the foregoing warrants, the warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis when there is not an effective registration statement covering the shares of common stock underling the warrant. In January 2008 we issued a consulting firm a four year common stock purchase warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $1.50 per share as partial compensation under the terms of an agreement. The warrant, which is not exercisable for the first year, is exercisable on a cashless basis. We granted the holder piggy back registration rights.

None of the selling security holders has, or within the past three years has had, any position, office or other material relationship with us or any of our predecessors or affiliates, other than as described previously in this section. 64 We have agreed to pay full costs and expenses, incentives to the issuance, offer, sale and delivery of the shares, including all fees and expenses in preparing, filing and printing the registration statement and prospectus and related exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto and mailing of those items. We will not pay selling commissions and expenses associated with any sale by the selling security holders. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION Each selling security holder and any of their pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares of common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board or any other stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. A selling security holder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares:  ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;  an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;  privately negotiated transactions;  settlement of short sales entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part;  broker-dealers may agree with the selling security holders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share;  through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;  a combination of any such methods of sale; or  any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. The selling security holders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as amended, if available, rather than under this prospectus. Broker-dealers engaged by the selling security holders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling security holders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) NASD Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with NASD IM-2440. In connection with the sale of the common stock or interests therein, the selling security holders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The selling security holders may also sell shares of the common stock short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The selling security holders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). 65 The selling security holders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. Each selling security holder has informed us that it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the common stock. In no event shall any broker-dealer receive fees, commissions and markups which, in the aggregate, would exceed eight percent (8%). We are required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by us incident to the registration of the shares. We have agreed to indemnify the selling security holders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Because selling security holders may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act including Rule 172 thereunder. In addition, any securities covered by this prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus. There is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale shares by the selling security holders. Under applicable rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale shares may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the common stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the selling security holders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of shares of the common stock by the selling security holders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the selling security holders and have informed them of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act). Shares Eligible For Future Sale At April 24, 2008 we had 42,375,868 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, of which approximately 36,214,940 shares are restricted securities. In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, a person, or person whose shares are aggregated, who is not our affiliate or has not been an affiliate during the prior three months and owns shares that were purchased from us, or any affiliate, at least six months previously, is entitled to make unlimited public resales of such shares provided there is current public information available at the time of the resales. After a one-year holding period a non-affiliate is entitled to make unlimited public resales of our shares without the requirement that current public information be available at the time of the resales. A person, or persons whose shares are aggregated, who are affiliates of our company and own shares that were purchased from us, or any affiliate, at least six months previously is entitled to sell within any three month period, a number of shares of our common stock that does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, subject to manner of sale provisions, notice requirements and the availability of current public information about us. 66 Future sales of restricted common stock under Rule 144 or otherwise or of the shares which we are registering under this prospectus could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. We are unable to estimate the number of shares that may be sold in the future by our existing shareholders or the effect, if any, that sales of shares by such shareholders will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by existing shareholders could adversely affect prevailing market prices.

F-6 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ........................ F-7 to F-31 F-1 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors Lotus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries Beijing, China We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lotus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purposes of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the amount and disclosures in the combined financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Lotus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. /s/ Sherb & Co., LLP -------------------- Certified Public Accountants Boca Raton, Florida March 17, 2008 F-2 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Liang Fang's affiliate, En Zhe Jia is a Chinese limited liability company and was formed under laws of the People's Republic of China on September 17, 1999. En Zhe Jia is the sole manufacturer for Liang Fang and maintains facilities for the production of medicines, patented Chinese medicine, as well as the research and production of other new medicines. As a result of the management agreements between Lotus International and Lotus East, Lotus East was deemed to be the acquirer of Lotus International for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the financial statement data presented are those of Lotus East for all periods prior to the Company's acquisition of Lotus International on September 28, 2006, and the financial statements of the consolidated companies from the acquisition date forward. On May 29, 2007, the Company formed a new entity, Lotus Century Pharmaceutical (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd. ("Lotus Century"), a wholly foreign-owned enterprise ("WFOE") organized under the laws of the Peoples' Republic of China. Lotus Century is a Chinese limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lotus Pharmaceutical International, Inc. Lotus Century intends to be engaged in development of innovative medicines, medical technology consulting and outsourcing services, and related training services. Basis of presentation - --------------------- The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("US GAAP"). The consolidated statements include the accounts of Lotus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Lotus and Lotus Century and variable interest entities under its control (Liang Fang and En Zhe Jia). All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Company has adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46R"), an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. FIN 46R requires a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which the Company, through contractual arrangements, bears the risks of, and enjoys the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entities, and therefore the Company is the primary beneficiary of these entities. As a VIE, Lotus East's revenues are included in the Company's total revenues, its income from operations is consolidated with the Company's, and the Company's net income includes all of Lotus East's net income. F-9 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Use of estimates - ---------------- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in 2007 and 2006 include the allowance for doubtful accounts, the allowance for obsolete inventory, the useful life of property and equipment and intangible assets, accruals for taxes due and stock-based compensation. Fair value of financial instruments - ----------------------------------- The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, convertible debt, customer advances, and amounts due from/to related parties approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. Cash and cash equivalents - ------------------------- For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and money market accounts to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions mainly in the PRC and the United States. Balances in the United States are insured up to $100,000 at each bank. Accounts receivable - ------------------- The Company records accounts receivable, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, customer's historical payment history, its current credit-worthiness and current economic trends. The amount of the provision, if any is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations within "General and administrative expenses". Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection. The Company policy regarding sales returns is discussed below. The activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns accounts for accounts receivable for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 is as follows: F-10 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Allowance Allowance for doubtful for sales accounts returns Total ----------- ----------- ----------- Balance - December 31, 2005 ....... $ 45,161 $ - $ 45,161 Additions ......................... 482,853 2,250,081 2,732,934 Foreign currency translation adjustments ..................... 11,613 47,318 58,931 ----------- ----------- ----------- Balance - December 31, 2006 ....... 539,627 2,297,399 2,837,026 Reductions ........................

An allowance is established when management determines that certain inventories may not be saleable. If inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand, the Company will record reserves for the difference between the cost and the market value. These reserves are recorded based on estimates and reflected in cost of sales. The Company recorded an inventory reserve of $42,554 and $280,251, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Property and equipment - ---------------------- Property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", the Company examines the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable. Impairment of long-lived assets - ------------------------------- In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", the Company periodically reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value. The Company did not consider it necessary to record any impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. F-11 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Advances from customers - ----------------------- Advances from customers at December 31, 2007 and 2006 of $34,531 and $231,340, respectively, consist of prepayments from third party customers to the Company for merchandise that had not yet shipped. The Company will recognize the advances as revenue as customers take delivery of the goods, in compliance with its revenue recognition policy. Income taxes - ------------ The Company is governed by the Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China and the United States. Income taxes are accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. Earnings per common share - ------------------------- Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of the common shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible debt (using the if-converted method). The following table presents a reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings per share: FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, ------------------------ 2007 2006 ----------- ----------- Net income for basic and diluted earnings per share .. $11,217,128 $ 4,143,020 ----------- ----------- Weighted average shares outstanding - basic .......... 41,417,434 40,360,530 Effect of dilutive securities: Convertible debentures ............................... 2,443,672 - ----------- ----------- Weighted average shares outstanding- diluted ......... 43,861,106 40,360,530 ----------- ----------- Earnings per share - basic ........................... $ 0.27 $ 0.10 =========== =========== Earnings per share - diluted ......................... $ 0.26 $ 0.10 =========== =========== In 2007, 1,500,000 outstanding warrants have not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per shares as the effect would be anti-dilutive. Revenue recognition - ------------------- Product sales Product sales are generally recognized when title to the product has transferred to customers in accordance with the terms of the sale. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Staff F-12 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, " Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements " as amended by SAB No. 104 (together, "SAB 104"), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 48 " Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists. " SAB 104 states that revenue should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned. In general, the Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. SFAS No. 48 states that revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product shall be recognized at the time of sale only if the seller's price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale, the buyer has paid the seller, or the buyer is obligated to pay the seller and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product, the buyer's obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product, the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller, the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer, and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated. The Company's net product revenues represent total product revenues less allowances for returns. Allowance for returns The Company accounts for sales returns in accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to its estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned. The Company determines the estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns, but also by considering other factors that could impact sales returns. These factors include levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product discontinuances, and price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products. In general, for wholesale sales, the Company provides credit for product returns that are returned six months prior to and up to six months after the product expiration date. Upon sale, the Company estimates an allowance for future product returns. The Company provides additional reserves for contemporaneous events that were not known and knowable at the time of shipment. In order to reasonably estimate future returns, the Company analyzed both quantitative and qualitative information including, but not limited to, actual return rates, the level of product manufactured by the Company, the level of product in the distribution channel, expected shelf life of the product, current and projected product demand, the introduction of new or generic products that may erode current demand, and general economic and industry wide indicators. The Company also utilizes the guidance provided in SAB 104 in establishing its return estimates. Historically, approximately 65% of our total revenues consist of sales of four principal products and product returns from these principal products, as well as the Company's other products, have been immaterial. Accordingly, based upon the Company's experience, it historically does not record a reserve at the time of sale and there have been no accounting entries related to its product return policy which have reduced its gross revenues or had any material impact on its financial statements. However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company sold approximately $2,300,000 of products which were either less popular products or products that were nearing their expiration dates to existing customers at reduced prices in a one-time transaction. The customers had the right to return these products pursuant to our product return policy. F-13 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Accordingly, the Company reduced its allowance for sales returns as during 2007 by $2,200,000 recorded as a reserve at December 31, 2006. The collection of this receivable had the effect of increasing the Company's net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 by $2,200,000, even though the sales of these products were actually made during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Because the Company recorded the costs associated with these products in its cost of sales during fiscal 2006, both the Company's gross profit margin and income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $2,200,000. The allowance for product returns at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $0 and $2,297,399, respectively. Because of the one-time nature of the transaction and the age of the products sold, the Company did not believe that the customary assumptions which it utilizes when determining the amount of reserve to establish for product returns, were appropriate, as it was more than remotely possible that all or substantially all of the products would be returned by the customer and the Company would not collect any revenues from this transaction. During the year ended December 31, 2007 the Company collected substantially all of the amounts billed to these customers for the product. Other revenues Other revenues consist of (i) leasing revenues received for the lease of retail space to various retail merchants; (ii) advertising revenues from the lease of counter space at the Company's retail locations; (iii) leasing revenue from the lease of retail space to licensed medical practitioners; (iv) revenues received by the Company for research and development projects and lab testing jobs conducted on behalf of third party companies, and; (v) revenues received for performing third party contract manufacturing projects. In connection with third-party manufacturing, the customer supplies the raw materials and we are paid a fee for manufacturing their product and revenue is recognized at the completion of the manufacturing job. The Company recognizes revenues from leasing of space and advertising revenues as earned from contracting third parties. The Company recognizes revenues upon performance of any research or lab testing jobs. Revenues received in advance are reflected as deferred revenue on the accompanying balance sheet. Additionally, the Company receives income from the sale of developed drug formulas. Income from the sale of drug formulas, if any, are recognized upon performance of all of the Company's obligations under the respective sales contract and are included in other income on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Concentrations of credit risk - ----------------------------- Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade accounts receivable. Substantially all of the Company's cash is maintained with state-owned banks within the People's Republic of China of which no deposits are covered by insurance. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risks on its cash in bank accounts. A significant portion of the Company's sales are credit sales which are primarily to customers whose ability to pay is dependent upon the industry economics prevailing in these areas; however, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables is limited due to generally short payment terms. The Company also performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to help further reduce credit risk. F-14 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Shipping costs - -------------- Shipping costs are included in cost of sales and totaled $420,082 and $570,152 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Advertising - ----------- Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses are included in selling expenses and totaled $2,602,997 and $81,888 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Foreign currency translation - ---------------------------- The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company is the local currency, the Chinese Renminbi ("RMB"). Results of operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period, assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate at the end of the period, and equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in determining comprehensive income. The cumulative translation adjustment and effect of exchange rate changes on cash at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $228,926 and $44,805, respectively. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred. Asset and liability accounts at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were translated at 7.3141 RMB to $1.00 USD and at 7.8175 RMB to $1.00 USD, respectively. Equity accounts were stated at their historical rate. The average translation rates applied to income statements for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were 7.6172 RMB and 7.9819 RMB to $1.00 USD, respectively. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows," cash flows from the Company's operations is calculated based upon the local currencies using the average translation rate. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet. Research and development - ------------------------ Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs primarily consist of cost of material used and salaries paid for the development of the Company's products and fees paid to third parties. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company entered into a various research and development agreement with third parties. Under the research and development agreements, the third parties are responsible for designing, researching and developing designated pharmaceutical projects for the Company. As part of the agreements, the Company paid RMB 24,000,000 (approximately $3.2 million) to these third parties. The Company will have the primary ownership of the designated research and development project results. For the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company expensed $2,411,651 and $387,337 as research and development expense, respectively, and paid for future research and development services in the amount of $769,742 at December 31, 2007, which has been included in prepaid expenses on the accompanying balance sheets and expensed over the contract term. F-15 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Accumulated other comprehensive income - -------------------------------------- Accumulated other comprehensive income consisted of unrealized gains on currency translation adjustments from the translation of financial statements from Chinese RMB to US dollars. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, accumulated other comprehensive income was $1,480,352 and $327,568, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements - -------------------------------- In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,"Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157), which provides guidance for how companies should measure fair value when required to use a fair value measurement for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP). SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on its financial statements. In September 2006, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-1, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Service Provider to Manufacturers or Resellers of Equipment Necessary for an End-Customer to Receive Service from the Service Provider (EITF 06-1). EITF 06-1 provides that consideration provided to the manufacturers or resellers of specialized equipment should be accounted for as a reduction of revenue if the consideration provided is in the form of cash and the service provider directs that such cash be provided directly to the customer. Otherwise, the consideration should be recorded as an expense. The provisions of EITF 06-1 will be effective on January 1, 2008. The adoption of EITF 06-1 will not have any effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In December 2006, FASB Staff Position No. EITF 00-19-2,"Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements" was issued. The FSP specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement, whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement, should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." The Company believes that its current accounting is consistent with the FSP. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,"The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" , under which entities will now be permitted to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS 157. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS 159 will have on its financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Accounting and Reporting of Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). These two standards must be adopted in conjunction with each other on a F-16 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements (continued) - -------------------------------------------- prospective basis. The most significant changes to business combination accounting pursuant to SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 are the following: (a) recognize, with certain exceptions, 100 percent of the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in acquisitions of less than a 100 percent controlling interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity, (b) acquirers' shares issued in consideration for a business combination will be measured at fair value on the closing date, not the announcement date, (c) recognize contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair values, with subsequent changes in fair value generally reflected in earnings, (d) the expensing of all transaction costs as incurred and most restructuring costs, (e) recognition of pre-acquisition loss and gain contingencies at their acquisition date fair values, with certain exceptions, (f) capitalization of acquired in-process research and development rather than expense recognition, (g) earn-out arrangements may be required to be re-measured at fair value and (h) recognize changes that result from a business combination transaction in an acquirer's existing income tax valuation allowances and tax uncertainty accruals as adjustments to income tax expense. The Company anticipates these new standards will significantly affect the Company's accounting for future business combinations following adoption on January 1, 2009. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-- an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 " ("FAS 161"). FAS 161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The guidance in FAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. This Statement encourages, but does not require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impact of FAS 161. Reclassifications - ----------------- Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period's financial statement presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The manufacturing rights issued are in connection with the Company's products Valsartan and Brimonidine. The manufacturing rights for Valsartan became effective in November 2000 and had a life of 6.5 years, which expired in 2007. The manufacturing rights for Brimonidine became effective on August 27, 2005 and have a life of 5 years. On October 9, 2006, the Company entered into a five-year loan agreement and a contract with Wu Lan Cha Bu Emergency Hospital ("Wu Lan"), whereby the Company agreed to lend to Wu Lan approximately $3,840,000 for the construction of a hospital ward in Inner Mongolia, China. In exchange for agreeing to lend to Wu Lan the funds, Wu Lan agreed that the Company will be the exclusive provider for all medicines and disposable medical treatment apparatus to Wu Lan for a period of twenty (20) years. In October 2006, the Company's chief executive officer, Mr. Liu, lent these funds to Wu Lan on behalf of the Company. The Company entered into an assignment agreement whereby the Company assigned all of its rights, obligations, and receipts under the Loan Agreement to Mr. Liu, except for the rights to revenues from the sale of medical and disposable medical treatment apparatus which will remain with the Company.

F-21 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 7 - CONVERTIBLE DEBT (continued) In connection with the debt issuance on February 12, 2007, $50,000 was deducted from the gross proceeds, which was deferred as a debt discount and will be amortized over the life of the convertible debentures. Other fees incurred in connection with the debt issuance include $234,719 of legal fees and other costs, which were treated as a deferred debt issue costs and are being amortized to debt issue cost expense over the life of the debenture. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") 98-5 and EITF 00-27, the convertible notes were considered to have an embedded beneficial conversion feature (BCF) because the effective conversion price was less than the fair value of the Company's common stock. This convertible notes were fully convertible at the issuance date, therefore the portion of proceeds allocated to the convertible notes of $808,420 was determined to be the value of the beneficial conversion feature and was recorded as a debt discount and is being amortized over the 12-months note term. The Purchasers also received Common Stock Purchase Warrants (the "Warrants"). Pursuant to the terms of the Warrants, the Purchasers are entitled to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $1.50 per share. The Warrants have a term of 5 years after the issue date of February 12, 2007. These warrants were treated as a discount on the secured notes and were valued at $808,419 to be amortized over the 12-month note term. The fair market value of each stock warrant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in accordance with SFAS No. 123R using the following weighted-average assumptions: expected dividend yield 0%; risk-free interest rate of 4.62%; volatility of 105% and an expected term of five years. During the year ended December 31, 2007, amortization of debt issue costs was $205,379. The remaining balance of debt issue costs at December 31, 2007 was $29,340. The amortization of debt discounts for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,458,484, which has been included in interest expense on the accompanying statement of operations. The balance of the debt discount is $208,355 at December 31, 2007.

F-22 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 7 - CONVERTIBLE DEBT (continued) The Company evaluated whether or not the secured convertible debentures contain embedded conversion options, which meet the definition of derivatives under SFAS 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and related interpretations. The Company concluded that since the secured convertible debentures had a fixed conversion rate of $1.00, the secured convertible debt was not a derivative instrument. The Company granted registration rights to holders of the Securities. Generally, the Company shall file with the Commission a Form SB-2 registration statement (the "Registration Statement") (or such other form that it is eligible to use) in order to register the Registrable Securities for resale and distribution under the 1933 Act within forty-five (45) calendar days after the Closing Date (the "Filing Date"), and cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective not later than one hundred and fifty (150) calendar days after the Closing Date (the "Effective Date").

(208,355) ----------- Convertible debentures, net ................................ $ 2,561,645 =========== In February 2008, in connection with a private placement (See Note 12), the convertible debt and any unpaid interest was repaid in full. NOTE 8 - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY In February 2007, the Company's Board of Directors and its consenting majority stockholders have adopted and approved an amendment to increase the number of the Company's authorized shares of capital stock from 50,000,000 to 210,000,000 total authorized shares of capital stock.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 8 - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (continued) In connection with the debt financing (See Note 7), the Company granted 1,500,000 to investors purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $1.50 per share. The Warrants have a term of 5 years after the issue date of February 12, 2007. On February 25, 2008, pursuant to a Convertible Redeemable Preferred Share and Warrant Purchase Agreement (See Note 14), the exercise price of these warrants were reduced to $1.20 per share. NOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. SFAS 109 additionally requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. Realization of deferred tax assets, including those related to the U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, are dependent upon future earnings, if any, of which the timing and amount are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax asset related to the U.S. net operating loss carryforward has been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The Company is governed by the Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China and the United States. Under the Income Tax Laws of PRC, Chinese companies are generally subject to an income tax at an effective rate of 33% (30% state income taxes plus 3% local income taxes) on income reported in the statutory financial statements after appropriate tax adjustments. The PRC local government has provided various incentives to companies in order to encourage economic development. Such incentives include reduced tax rates and other measures. Since 2002, the Company has been entitled to an income tax exemption for a six-year period and was exempted from all of its income tax in the 2007 and 2006 period. The estimated tax savings due to the tax exemption for the years ending December 31, 2007 and 2006 amounted to approximately $4,600,000 and $1,400,000, respectively. The net effect on earnings per share if the income tax had been applied would decrease basic earnings per share for December 31, 2007 and 2006 to $0.16 and $0.07, respectively. Lotus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was incorporated in the United States and has incurred net operating losses of $704,000 for income tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2007 subject to the Internal Revenue Code Section 382, which places a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by net operating losses after a change in ownership. The net operating loss carries forwards for United States income taxes, which may be available to reduce future years' taxable income. These carry forwards will expire, if not utilize, through 2027. Management believes that the realization of the benefits from these losses appears uncertain due to the Company's limited operating history and continuing losses for United States income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Company has provided a 100% valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset benefit to reduce the asset to zero. Management will review this valuation allowance periodically and make adjustments as warranted. The valuation allowance at December 31, 2007 was approximately $246,000. The consolidated income is earned overseas and the Company does not intend to repatriate the funds and, in the event of repatriation there will be a tax on the repatriated income The components of income (loss) before income tax consist of the following: Year Ended December 31, ------------------------------ 2007 2006 ------------ ----------- U.S. Operations ......... $ (2,801,788) $ (153,800) Chinese Operations ...... 14,018,916 4,296,820 ------------ ----------- $ 11,217,128 $ 4,143,020 ============ =========== F-24 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Beginning January 1, 2008, the new PRC Enterprise Income Tax ("EIT") law will replace the existing laws for PRC Domestic Enterprises ("DES") and PRC Foreign Invested Enterprises ("FIEs"). The key changes are: a. The new standard PRC EIT rate of 25% will replace the 33% rate currently applicable to both DES and FIEs, except for High Tech companies who pays a reduced rate of 15%; and b. Companies established before March 16, 2007 will continue to enjoy tax holiday treatment approved by local government for a grace period of the next 5 years or until the tax holiday term is completed, whichever is sooner. BUSINESS TAX and VALUE ADDED TAX The Company is subject to value added tax ("VAT") for manufacturing products and business tax for services provided. The applicable VAT tax rate is 17% for products sold in the PRC, and the business tax rate is 5% for services provided in PRC. The amount of VAT liability is determined by applying the applicable tax rate to the invoiced amount of goods sold (output VAT) less VAT paid on purchases made with the relevant supporting invoices (input VAT). Under the commercial practice of the PRC, the Company paid value added taxes ("VAT") and business tax based on tax invoices issued. The tax invoices may be issued subsequent to the date on which revenue is recognized, and there may be a considerable delay between the date on which the revenue is recognized and the date on which the tax invoice is issued. In the event that the PRC tax authorities dispute the date of which revenue is recognized for tax purposes, the PRC tax office has the right to assess a penalty, which can range from zero to five times the amount of the taxes which are determined to be late or deficient. According to the PRC tax laws, any potential tax penalty payable on late or deficient payments of this tax could be between zero and five times the F-25 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES (continued) amount of the late or deficient tax payable, and will be expensed as a period expense if and when a determination has been made by the taxing authorities that a penalty is due. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company accrued $572,200 and $2,047,851, respectively of unpaid business and value-added taxes. In January 2008, the Chinese local government granted Lotus East a special tax waiver to exempt and release any unpaid value added tax liabilities and any related penalties as of December 31, 2007 and for all periods prior to December 31, 2007. In connection with this special tax waiver, the Company recorded a gain from forgiveness of unpaid value-added tax of $2,160,795.

NOTE 12 - OPERATING RISK (a) Country risk Currently, the Company's revenues are primarily derived from the sale of pharmaceutical products to customers in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). The Company hopes to expand its operations to countries outside the PRC, however, such expansion has not been commenced and there are no assurances that the Company will be able to achieve such an expansion successfully. Therefore, a downturn or stagnation in the economic environment of the PRC could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition. (b) Products risk In addition to competing with other manufacturers of pharmaceutical product offerings, the Company competes with larger Chinese and International companies who may have greater funds available for expansion, marketing, research and development and the ability to attract more qualified personnel. These Chinese companies may be able to offer products at a lower price. There can be no assurance that the Company will remain competitive. (c) Political risk Currently, PRC is in a period of growth and is openly promoting business development in order to bring more business into PRC. Additionally PRC allows a Chinese corporation to be owned by a United States corporation. If the laws or regulations are changed by the PRC government, the Company's ability to operate the PRC subsidiaries could be affected. F-27 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 13 - RESTATEMENT For the year ending December 31, 2006, the Company revised certain accounting treatment related to the recording of an intangible asset and a corresponding related party liability associated with an assignment agreement and exclusive revenue rights as described in Notes 4 and 5. The Company initially did not record the value of the intangible asset and corresponding liability and treated payment due under the assignment agreement as a periodic payment of interest expense to the Company's chief executive officer. Subsequently, the Company determined that an intangible asset and a corresponding related party liability should have been recorded. Accordingly, the adjustments to the financial statements for this adjustment were as follows: 1. Balance Sheet: a) Intangible assets increased by $1,136,872 to $1,345,041 from $208,169 and total assets increased by $1,136,872. This increase reflects the addition of an intangible asset of $1,151,263 offset by an increase in accumulated amortization of $14,391 b) Due to related parties increased by $1,093,700 which increased total current liabilities by $230,253 and long-term liabilities by $863,447. This increase reflects the addition of a related party payable of $1,151,263 offset by the repayment of this payable of approximately $57,500. Stockholders' equity increased $43,172 which reflect the changes made to the balance sheet and statement of operations as well as an increase in comprehensive income of $889. 2. Statement of Operations: a) General and administrative expenses decreased by $42,283 which reflects an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of $14,095 offset by a decrease in assignment fee expenses of $56,378 due to the reversal of the periodic assignment fee expense previously recorded. 3. Statement of Cash Flows: a) For the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash flows provided by operating activities increased by $56,378 and net cash used in financing activities increased by $56,378. NOTE 14 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT In January 2008, the Company issued 250,000 shares of its common in connection with the conversion of $250,000 of convertible debt. On February 25, 2008, the Company entered into a Convertible Redeemable Preferred Share and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") by and among the Company, Dr. Liu Zhong Yi and Mrs. Song Zhenghong (the "Founders"), and accredited investors (each a "Purchaser" and collectively, the "Purchasers"), pursuant to which the Company sold to the Purchasers 5,747,118 shares of the Company's series A convertible redeemable preferred stock and warrants to purchase 2,873,553 shares of the Company's common stock, in a private placement pursuant to Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, for the aggregate purchase price of $5 million (the "Transaction"). The Transaction closed on February 25, 2008 (the "Closing Date"). Net proceeds, exclusive of expenses of the Transaction, from the sale to the Company were $4.6 million, after the Company paid fees of $400,000 to Maxim Group, LLC, its placement agent for the Transaction. The Company used $2,576,556 of the net proceeds of the Transaction to repay in full all of its outstanding obligations under the 14% Secured Convertible Notes due February 2008 and the Company will use the remainder of the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. F-28 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 14 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT (continued) The Purchase Agreement includes customary representations and warranties by each party thereto. The following is a brief description of the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder that are material to the Company: Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued to the Purchasers an aggregate of 5,747,118 shares of the Company's series A convertible redeemable preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a price equal to $0.87 per share (the "Preferred Shares"). Each of these Preferred Shares may be converted into one share of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like). The Preferred Shares pay an 8% dividend annually, which is payable in additional Preferred Shares. Preferred Shares also pay any dividend paid on the common shares on an as converted basis. For a period of 90 days after February 25, 2010, these Preferred Shares may also be redeemed at the option of the Purchasers at the redemption price of $0.87 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like), and no other capital stock of the Company may be redeemable prior to the Preferred Shares. The designation, rights, preferences and other terms and provisions of the Preferred Shares are set forth in the Certificate of Designation filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on February 25, 2008. Holders of Preferred Shares may not convert Preferred Shares to common shares if the conversion would result in the holder beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the Company's outstanding common shares. That limitation may be waived by a holder of Preferred Shares on not less than 61 days written notice to the Company. The Preferred Shares vote with the common stock on an as converted basis, except that the Preferred Shares are not entitled to vote for directors. The Company is prohibited from taking certain corporate actions, including, without limitation, issuing securities senior to the Preferred Shares, selling substantially all assets, repurchasing securities and declaring or paying dividends, without the approval of the holders of a majority of the Preferred Shares outstanding. In addition, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued to the Purchasers warrants to purchase up to 2,873,553 shares of the Company's common stock in the aggregate. The warrants have an initial exercise price of $1.20 (subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the warrants). The warrants are exercisable for a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date. Holders of the warrants may not exercise the warrants if the exercise would result in the holder beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the Company's outstanding common shares. That limitation may be waived by a holder of the warrants on not less than 61 days written notice to the Company. Under the Certificate of Designation, the Purchasers have a preemptive right, from the Closing Date until the conclusion of a public offering by the Company, to purchase any equity securities being offered by Company that may be convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for the Company's common stock or its equivalent. The amount of such securities that each Purchaser may acquire is determined based on the ratio of the total number of common stock such Purchaser may own (assuming full conversion of the Purchaser's Preferred Shares and full exercise of warrants) to the total number of outstanding common stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis. The preemptive right, however, does not extend to the following instances: (i) common stock issued pursuant to an equity incentive plan, stock option plan, stock option agreement, restricted stock agreement, stock ownership plan or dividend reinvestment plan of the Company that is currently in effect and is disclosed; (ii) restricted stock or options to purchase common stock pursuant to an equity incentive plan or stock option plan that is currently in effect and is disclosed; (iii) stock options or restricted stock grants to employees, officers, directors or consultants, whether or not pursuant to an equity incentive plan; (iv) common stock issuable F-29 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 14 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT (continued) upon the conversion or the exercise of securities, options or warrants outstanding at the closing of this Transaction, including the warrants sold pursuant to this Transaction, provided that the terms of such securities, options or warrants are not amended, modified or changed on or after the Closing Date; (v) common stock or any other security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock in connection with an acquisition transaction (including by way of a merger or consolidation), the primary purpose of which is not to raise equity capital; (vi) securities issued to customers, vendors, licensors or joint venture partners or in connection with strategic alliances approved by the Company's board of directors, the primary purpose of which is not to raise equity capital; (vii) securities issued in connection with an equipment lease financing transaction or a credit financing transaction with a bank or institutional lender approved by the Company's board of directors, the primary purpose of which is not to raise equity capital; or (viii) common stock issuable upon the conversion or exercise of any convertible securities, options or warrants issued and outstanding from the foregoing seven scenarios. Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company has also agreed to undertake to file a registration statement within 60 days following the Closing Date in order to register the maximum number of common stock issuable from conversion of the Preferred Shares and underlying the warrants that is allowable under applicable federal securities regulations. The Company is also obligated to have the registration statement declared effective within 120 days following the Closing Date. If the Company is informed by the SEC that there are no comments to the registration statement, then the registration statement must be effective within five (5) business days thereafter or on the 60th day after the filing date, which ever is sooner. The registration statement must be declared effective by the 120th day after its filing if the SEC has comments. Otherwise, the Company is subject to liquidated damages, equal to 1% of the total conversion price and exercise price for the common stock being registered under the registration statement, for every 30-day period following the date that the registration statement should have been effective, prorated for any period less than 30 days, until either all of common shares registered under the registration statement have been sold or all such common shares may be sold in any three (3) month period pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, whichever is earlier. The Company must also pay the liquidated damages if sales cannot be made pursuant to the registration statement for any reason (excepting market conditions). The maximum amount of liquidated damages is $500,000. The Company is also obligated, under the Purchase Agreement, to indemnify the Purchasers against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising from any untruth in or omission of material facts, or violation of applicable federal or state securities law or regulation, in the registration statement. However, if the Company's action is the result of the Company's reliance on the Purchasers' representations, then the Purchasers must indemnify the Company and its directors and officers. F-30 LOTUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 and 2006 NOTE 14 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT (continued) In connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Founders delivered in the aggregate 7,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock owned by them (the "Escrow Shares") to an escrow account. Portions of the Escrow Shares are being held in escrow subject to the Company meeting certain earning targets in fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009. The target for 2007 is $8.5 million in net income. The target for 2008 is 95% of $13.8 million in net income after eliminating the effect of non-cash charges associated with the Transaction and adjusting for differences in the exchange rate between Chinese Renminbi and US dollars used in the Company's 2008 financial statements and an exchange rate of RMB 7.30 to USD 1.00. The target for 2009 is 95% of $17.5 million in net income after eliminating the effect of non-cash charges associated with the Transaction and adjusting for differences in the exchange rate between Chinese Renminbi and US dollars used in the Company's 2009 financial statements and an exchange rate of RMB 7.30 to USD 1.00. These Escrow Shares will be transferred to the Purchasers if the Company does not meet the earning targets, and released back to the Founders if the Company does. Another portion of the Escrow Shares is being held in escrow subject to the Company listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market within 18 months following the Closing Date. These Escrow Shares will be transferred to the Purchasers if the listing is not completed within that time period, and released back to the Founders if it is. Finally, two-thirds of the Escrow Shares are held in escrow to ensure that the Purchasers receive their full redemption payments if they choose to redeem their Preferred Shares. Each Preferred Share may be redeemed for $0.87 per share (adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like). If a Purchaser receives less than the full redemption amount for each Preferred Share being redeemed, the Purchaser will receive a number of Escrow Shares to make up the difference, based on the then-current market price of the common shares. Following the end of the redemption period, these Escrow Shares, less those transferred to any Purchasers that redeemed their Preferred Shares, will be released back to the Founders.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers. The Nevada Revised Statutes allows us to indemnify each of our officers and directors who are made a party to a proceeding if: (a) the officer or director conducted himself or herself in good faith; (b) his or her conduct was in our best interests, or if the conduct was not in an official capacity, that the conduct was not opposed to our best interests; and (c) in the case of a criminal proceeding, he or she had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. We may not indemnify our officers or directors in connection with a proceeding by or in our right, where the officer or director was adjudged liable to us, or in any other proceeding, where our officer or director are found to have derived an improper personal benefit. Our by-laws require us to indemnify directors and officers against, to the fullest extent permitted by law, liabilities which they may incur under the circumstances described above. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling our company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the act and is therefore unenforceable. Item 25. Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution. The estimated expenses payable by us in connection with the distribution of the securities being registered are as follows: SEC Registration and Filing Fee $ 405 Legal Fees and Expenses* 25,000 Accounting Fees and Expenses* 7,500 Financial Printing* 1,500 Transfer Agent Fees* 500 Blue Sky Fees and Expenses* 500 Miscellaneous* 595 TOTAL $ 36,000 * Estimated II-1 Item 26. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities. Following are all issuances of securities by the registrant during the past three years which were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). In each of these issuances the recipient represented that he was acquiring the shares for investment purposes only, and not with a view towards distribution or resale except in compliance with applicable securities laws. No general solicitation or advertising was used in connection with any transaction, and the certificate evidencing the securities that were issued contained a legend restricting their transferability absent registration under the Securities Act or the availability of an applicable exemption therefrom. Unless specifically set forth below, no underwriter participated in the transaction and no commissions were paid in connection with the transactions. Under the Share Exchange Agreement with Lotus International, on September 6, 2006 we issued 40,041,600 shares of our common stock to the Lotus International stockholders in exchange for 100% of the common stock of Lotus International in a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on an exemption provided by Regulation S and Section 4(2) of that act. The recipients were non U.S. persons. In February 2007, we sold $3,000,000 principal amount secured convertible notes to two accredited investors and issued those investors common stock purchase warrants to purchase 1,500,000 shares of our common stock in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on an exemption provided by Regulation D of the Securities Act and Section 4(2) of that act. In May 2007, we issued 74,000 shares of our common stock valued at $74,200 to an officer and director of the company as compensation for services rendered. The recipient was an accredited investor and the issuance was exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on an exemption provided by Section 4(2) of that act. In September 2007 we issued an aggregate of 210,000 shares of our common stock valued at $210,000 to seven members of our Board of Directors as compensation for services rendered. The recipients were accredited investors and the issuance was exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on an exemption provided by Section 4(2) of that act. In April 2008 we issued an aggregate of 258,622 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $225,000 to current and former members of our Board of Directors as compensation for services rendered. The recipients were accredited investors and the issuance was exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on an exemption provided by Section 4(2) of that act. In April 2008 we also issued an aggregate of 73,046 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $63,550 to two employees of the consulting firm that provides outsourced financial advisory services to us as partial compensation for that firms services.

(8) Incorporated by reference from the Current Report on Form 8-K/A as filed on February 29, 2008. II-4 Item 28. Undertakings. The registrant will: (1) File, during any period in which it offers or sales securities, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement to: (i) Include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act; (ii) Reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in the volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) Include any additional or changed material information to the plan of distribution. (2) For determining liability under the Securities Act, treat each post-effective amendment as a new registration statement of the securities offered, and the offering of the securities at that time to be the initial bona fide offering. (3) File a post-effective amendment to remove from registration any of the securities that remain unsold at then end of the offering. (4) For determining liability of the undersigned registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: i. Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; ii. Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; iii. The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and iv. Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. II-5 (5) For determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. II-6 SIGNATURES In accordance with the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements of filing on Form S-1 and authorized this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, in the city of Beijing, China on May 13, 2008.
