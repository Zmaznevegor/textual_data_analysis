Our Company We are one of the worlds leading software and IT services companies. We provide software and processing solutions to institutions throughout the financial services industry, higher education, and the public sector; and we help enterprises of all types to maintain the continuity of their business through information availability services. We operate our business in four segments: Financial Systems (FS)serves financial services companies, corporate and government treasury departments and energy companies; Higher Education (HE)serves higher education institutions; Public Sector (PS)serves state and local governments, public safety and justice agencies, and not-for-profit organizations; and Availability Services (AS)serves IT-dependent companies across virtually all industries. We serve more than 25,000 customers in over 50 countries, including the worlds 50 largest financial services companies. We seek to establish long-term customer relationships by negotiating multi-year contracts and by emphasizing customer support and product quality and integration. We believe that we are one of the most efficient operators of mission-critical IT solutions as a result of the economies of scale we derive from serving multiple customers on shared platforms. Our revenue is highly diversified by customer and product, with no single customer accounting for more than 4% of our total revenue during any of the past three fiscal years. We estimate that approximately 89% of our revenue for the past three fiscal years was recurring in nature. We were acquired on August 11, 2005 by a consortium of private equity investment funds associated with Bain Capital Partners, The Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs & Co., Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Providence Equity Partners, Silver Lake and Texas Pacific Group (the Transaction). 1 Table of Contents Our Segments Software & Processing Financial Systems Higher Education Public Sector Availability Services Revenue for the Year Ended December 31, 2007  $2.5 billion  $543 million  $410 million  $1.4 billion Product and Service Offerings  Specialized software and processing solutions that automate the business processes associated with trading securities, managing portfolios and accounting for investment assets, consulting services, and IT management services  Specialized software and enterprise resource planning solutions, professional services, consulting services and IT management services to address the administrative, academic and community needs of higher education institutions  Specialized software and enterprise resource planning and administrative solutions, public safety and justice solutions, K-12 student information solutions, consulting services and IT management services  Portfolio of always ready standby services, as well as advanced recovery and always on production services that help companies maintain uninterrupted access to their mission-critical IT systems Number of Customers  15,000  1,600  2,000  10,000 Primary Customers  Financial services companies  Corporate and government treasury departments  Energy companies  Higher education institutions  School districts  State and local governments  Central and federal government  Public safety and justice agencies  Not-for-profit organizations  Large, medium and small companies across virtually all industries Financial Systems FS provides mission-critical software and IT services to institutions in virtually every segment of the financial services industry.

Our HE solutions help institutions worldwide strengthen institutional performance by improving constituent services, increasing accountability, and enhancing the education experience.

Public Sector In PS, we provide software and processing solutions designed to meet the specialized needs of local, state, federal and central governments, public safety and justice agencies, public schools, utilities, non-profits, and other public sector institutions. Our systems and services help institutions improve the efficiency of their operations and utilize the Web and wireless technologies in serving their constituents. Our PS solutions support a range of specialized enterprise resource planning and administrative solutions for functions such as accounting, human resources, payroll, utility billing, land management, public safety and criminal justice, and grant and project management. Availability Services In AS, we help our customers improve the uptime and resilience of the information and computer systems they need to run their business by providing them with cost-effective resources to help keep their IT systems reliable and secure. Since we pioneered commercial disaster recovery in the 1970s, we believe that our dedicated focus on information availability solutions, together with our experience, technology expertise, resource management capabilities, vendor neutrality and diverse service offerings, have uniquely positioned us to meet customers varied needs in an environment where business functions are critically dependent on availability of IT. Over three decades, we have developed a comprehensive portfolio of information availability services that extend from always ready standby services, to blended advanced recovery services, to always on production and managed services. We also provide consulting services to help our customers design, implement and maintain their mission-critical systems. To serve our 10,000 AS customers, we utilize 4,000,000 square feet of operations space at over 60 locations in 10 countries and a global network of approximately 25,000 miles. Since our inception, we have had a 100% success rate supporting customer recoveries from unplanned interruptions, including during recent major disasters including the 2007 U.K. floods, the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes, 2004 Florida hurricanes, the 2003 Northeast U.S. blackout and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Our Strengths Leading franchise in attractive industries. Built over many years, our business has leading positions and strong customer relationships in industries with attractive growth dynamics.  Leading industry positions. We believe that the majority of businesses within our FS segment are leaders in the sectors in which they participate within the highly fragmented global market for financial services IT software and services. We believe that HE and PS are both leading providers of software and services to higher education institutions and the public sector, respectively. AS is the pioneer and leading provider in the availability services industry.  Attractive industry dynamics. We believe that the sectors in which we participate have favorable growth dynamics. We believe that FS will benefit from several key industry dynamics: the shift from internal to external IT spending, the shift from infrastructure to application software spending, and the general increase in IT spending associated with rising compliance and regulatory requirements and 3 Table of Contents real-time information needs. We anticipate that HE and PS will benefit from favorable growth dynamics in higher education and public safety IT spending. We believe that AS will continue to benefit from strong organic growth in the small and medium business sector. We believe that our strong relationships with our customers in the relatively fragmented software and processing sectors that we serve and our extensive experience and the significant total capital that we have invested in AS help us to maintain leading positions. We believe that these factors provide us with competitive advantages and enhance our growth potential. Highly attractive business model. Our portfolio of businesses has substantial recurring revenue, a diversified customer base and significant operating cash flow generation.  Extensive portfolio of businesses with substantial recurring revenue. With a large portfolio of services and products in each of our four business segments, we have a diversified and stable business. We estimate that approximately 89% of our revenue for the past three fiscal years was recurring in nature. Because our FS customers generally pay us monthly fees that are based on metrics such as number of accounts or assets under management, we believe that our FS revenue is more insulated from trading and transaction volumes than the financial services industry at large. Our portfolio of businesses and the largely recurring nature of our revenue across all four of our segments have reduced volatility in our revenue and income from operations.  Diversified and stable customer base. Our base of more than 25,000 customers includes the worlds 50 largest financial services firms, a variety of other financial services firms, corporate and government treasury departments, energy companies, higher education institutions, school districts, local governments and not-for-profit organizations. Our AS business serves customers across virtually all industries. We believe that our specialized solutions and services help our customers improve operational efficiency, capture growth opportunities and respond to regulatory requirements, which results in long-term customer relationships. Our customer base is highly diversified with no single customer accounting for more than 4% of total revenue during any of the last three fiscal years.  Significant operating cash flow generation. The combination of moderate capital expenditures and minimal working capital requirements allows us to convert a significant proportion of our revenue to cash available for debt service. Experienced and committed management team with track record of success. Our management team fosters an entrepreneurial culture, has a long track record of operational excellence, has a proven ability to acquire and integrate complementary businesses, and is highly committed to our companys long-term success.  Long track record of operational excellence. We have a solid track record of performance consistent with internal financial targets. Our experienced senior executive officers have proven capabilities in both running a global business and managing numerous applications that are important to our customers. Our FS solutions account for and manage over $25 trillion in investment assets and process over 5 million transactions per day. In our HE business, more than 1,600 institutions rely on SunGard Higher Education to support their campuses. Our PS products are used by agencies that serve more than 100 million citizens in North America and 50 million citizens in the U.K. Our AS business has had a 100% success rate in supporting customer recoveries since our inception.  Successful, disciplined acquisition program. To complement our organic growth, we have a highly disciplined due diligence program to evaluate, execute and integrate acquisitions. We have completed more than 160 acquisitions over the past 20 years and overall have improved the operating performance of acquired businesses. Our ongoing acquisition program has contributed significantly to our long-term growth and success.  Experienced and committed management team. Our executive officers have on average more than 15 years of industry experience. Our senior managers have committed significant personal capital to our company in connection with the Transaction. 4 Table of Contents Business Strategy We are focused on expanding our position not only as a leading provider of integrated software and processing solutions, but also as the provider of choice for a wide range of availability services for IT-dependent companies. Our operating and financial strategy emphasizes fiscal discipline, profitable revenue growth and significant operating cash flow generation. In pursuit of these objectives, we have implemented the following strategies: Expand our industry-leading franchise. We are constantly enhancing our product and service offerings across our portfolio of businesses, further building and leveraging our customer relationships, and looking to acquire complementary businesses at attractive valuations.  Enhance our product and service offerings. We continually support, upgrade and enhance our systems to incorporate new technology and meet the needs of our customers for increased operational efficiency and resilience. Our strong base of recurring revenue allows us to reinvest in our products and services. We continue to introduce innovative products and services in all four of our business segments. We believe that our focus on product enhancement and innovation will help us to increase our penetration of existing and new customers.  Extend our strong customer relationships. We focus on developing trusted, well-managed, long-term relationships with our customers. We look to maximize cross-selling opportunities, increase our share of our customers total IT spending and maintain a high level of customer satisfaction. Our global account management program allows us to present a single face to our larger FS customers as well as better target potential cross-selling opportunities.  Acquire and integrate complementary businesses. We seek opportunistically to acquire, at attractive valuations, businesses that broaden our existing product and service offerings, expand our customer base and strengthen our leadership positions, especially within the fragmented FS, HE and PS markets. Before committing to an acquisition, we devote significant resources to due diligence and to developing a post-acquisition integration plan, including the identification and quantification of potential cost savings and synergies. Our ongoing acquisition program has contributed significantly to our long-term growth and success. Optimize our attractive business model. We continue to focus on maintaining our attractive business model and, in particular, increasing our recurring revenue base and implementing incremental operational improvements.  Increase our recurring revenue base. We strive to generate a high level of recurring revenue and stable cash flow from operations. We prefer to charge customers monthly subscription fees under multi-year contracts, and we continue to prefer such contracts because they offer high levels of revenue stability and visibility. Moreover, we believe that our high quality services and customized solutions help increase the level of integration and efficiency for our customers and reduce customer defections to other vendors or to in-house solutions.  Implement incremental operational improvements. We have identified opportunities to further increase revenue, reduce costs and improve cash flow from operations. These include the global account management program within FS, which stimulates cross-selling opportunities and account penetration for our largest customers; centralization of certain product management functions and expansion of certain software development capacity in lower-cost regions; the selective integration of certain FS, HE and PS business units and back-office operations; and the increased focus on generating revenue from ancillary services such as customer training and education as well as consulting. 5 Table of Contents Enhance our performance-based culture. We have an experienced management team that is focused on enhancing our performance-based culture. We continue to evaluate and implement programs to improve our current management structure through competitive compensation plans and continue to design effective human resources initiatives to retain key individuals at acquired businesses. Our compensation program, consistent with past practices, is highly performance-based. SunGard Data Systems Inc. was incorporated under Delaware law in 1982.

See Description of Senior NotesRepurchase at the Option of HoldersChange of Control and Description of Senior Subordinated NotesRepurchase at the Option of HoldersChange of Control. We may not be able to pay you the required price for notes you present to us at the time of a change of control, because:  we may not have enough funds at that time; or  terms of our senior debt, including, in the case of the senior subordinated notes, the indenture governing the senior notes, may prevent us from making such payment Your right to require us to repurchase a series of notes upon the occurrence of a change of control will be suspended during any time that the applicable series of notes have investment grade ratings from both Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poors. Certain Indenture Provisions The indentures governing the notes contain covenants limiting our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:  incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;  pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;  make certain investments;  sell certain investments;  create liens on certain assets to secure debt;  consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and  designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. 10 Table of Contents These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. See Description of Senior Notes and Description of Senior Subordinated Notes. Certain covenants will cease to apply to a series of notes at all times after the applicable series of notes have investment grade ratings from both Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poors. No Public Market The notes are freely transferable but are new securities for which there may not be an active trading market. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the future liquidity of any market. The initial purchasers in the private offering of the notes have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes. The initial purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the notes, and any such market-making may be discontinued by the initial purchasers in their discretion at any time without notice. Risk Factors You should carefully consider all the information in the prospectus prior to investing in the notes. In particular, we urge you to consider carefully consider the factors set forth under the heading Risk Factors. 11 Table of Contents SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA Set forth below is summary historical consolidated financial data, at the dates and for the periods indicated. The historical data for the periods ended August 10 and December 31, 2005 and the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 have been derived from SunGards historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.

During the period from August 11 through December 31, 2005, we recorded merger costs of $18 million consisting primarily of payroll taxes and certain compensation expenses related to the Transaction. (2) During the period from August 11 through December 31, 2005, we recorded $17 million related to the loss on sale of the receivables and discount on retained interests in connection with the receivables facility. During 2006, we recorded $29 million related to the loss on sale of the receivables and discount on retained interests in connection with the receivables facility. During 2007, we recorded $29 million related to the loss 12 Table of Contents on sale of the receivables and discount on retained interests in connection with the receivables facility and $28 million associated with the early retirement of the $400 million of senior floating rate notes due 2013, of which $19 million represented the retirement premium paid to the noteholders. (3) EBITDA, a measure used by management to measure operating performance, is defined as net income plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a recognized term under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for managements discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. Management believes EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends because EBITDA can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. In addition, EBITDA provides more comparability between the historical results of SunGard and results that reflect purchase accounting and the new capital structure. Management compensates for the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures by using them to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations of EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Historical EBITDA is calculated as follows: Predecessor Successor Successor January 1 through August 10, 2005 August 11 through December 31, 2005 Combined Year Ended December 31, 2005 Year Ended December 31, 2006 Year Ended December 31, 2007 (Dollars in millions) Net income $ 146 $ (29 ) $ 117 $ (118 ) $ (60 ) Interest expense, net 8 242 250 642 626 Taxes 142 (33 ) 109 (21 ) (3 ) Depreciation and amortization 225 236 461 637 689 EBITDA $ 521 $ 416 $ 937 $ 1,140 $ 1,252 (4) Capital expenditures represent net cash paid for property and equipment as well as software and other assets. 13 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this prospectus before deciding whether to invest in the notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of the notes could decline or we may not be able to make payments of interest and principal on the notes, and you may lose some or all of your investment. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations. As a result of being acquired on August 11, 2005 by a consortium of private equity investment funds, we are highly leveraged and our debt service requirements are significant. At December 31, 2007, our total indebtedness was $7.49 billion, and we had $941 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility, after giving effect to certain outstanding letters of credit. In addition, at December 31, 2007, we had outstanding $441 million of our $450 million off-balance sheet receivables facility. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:  making it more difficult for us to make payments on our debt obligations;  increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;  requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;  exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and our receivables facility, are at variable rates of interest;  restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and  limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures relating to our senior notes and senior subordinated notes. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. At December 31, 2007, we had total debt of $7.49 billion, including $4.37 billion of variable rate debt. We entered into two interest rate swap agreements which fixed the interest rates for $1.6 billion of our variable rate debt. Our two swap agreements each have a notional value of $800 million, effectively fix our interest rates at 4.85% and 5.00%, respectively, and expire in February 2009 and February 2011, respectively. In January 2008, we entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of $750 million, under which we are required to pay the counterparty a stream of fixed rate interest payments of 3.17%, and, in turn, receive variable interest payments based on LIBOR from the counterparty. In February 2008, we entered into a two year 14 Table of Contents interest rate swap agreement for an additional notional amount of $750 million, under which we are required to pay the counterparty a stream of fixed rate interest payments of 2.71%, and, in turn, receive variable interest payments based on LIBOR from the counterparty. Our remaining variable rate debt of $1.27 billion is subject to changes in underlying interest rates and our interest payments will also change as a result of market changes. During the period when our interest rate swap agreements are effective, a 1% change in interest rates would result in a change in interest of approximately $13 million per year. Upon the expiration of interest rate swap agreements in February in each of 2009, 2010 and 2011, a 1% change in interest rates would result in a change in interest of approximately $21 million, $28 million and $44 million per year, respectively. Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. Our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing the notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:  incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;  pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;  make certain investments;  sell certain assets;  create liens;  consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. In addition, under the senior secured credit agreement, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios and tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit agreement. Upon an event of default under the senior secured credit agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the senior secured credit agreement and, to the extent required by the indenture governing the senior secured notes, the senior secured notes. If the lenders under the senior secured credit agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay the senior secured credit facilities and the senior secured notes, as well as our unsecured indebtedness. Risks Related to Our Business Our business depends largely on the economy and financial markets, and a slowdown or downturn in the economy or financial markets could adversely affect our business and results of operations. When there is a slowdown or downturn in the economy, a drop in stock market levels or trading volumes, or an event that disrupts the financial markets, our business and financial results may suffer for a number of reasons. Customers may react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their IT spending. In addition, customers may curtail or discontinue trading operations, delay or cancel IT projects, or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts. Also, customers with excess IT resources may choose to take their availability solutions in-house rather than obtain those solutions from us. Moreover, competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our 15 Table of Contents customers to lower cost solutions. If any of these circumstances remain in effect for an extended period of time, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results. Because our financial performance tends to lag behind fluctuations in the economy, our recovery from any particular downturn in the economy may not occur until after economic conditions have generally improved. Our business depends largely on the financial services industry, and a weakening of the financial services industry could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Because our customer base is concentrated in the financial services industry, our business is largely dependent on the health of that industry. When there is a general downturn in the financial services industry, or if our customers in that industry experience financial or business problems, our business and financial results may suffer. If financial services firms continue to consolidate, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. When a customer merges with a firm using its own solution or another vendors solution, they could decide to consolidate on a non-SunGard system, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. Our acquisition program is an important element of our strategy but, because of the uncertainties involved, this program may not be successful and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses. Part of our growth strategy is to pursue additional acquisitions in the future. There can be no assurance that our acquisition program will continue to be successful. In addition, we may finance any future acquisition with debt, which would increase our interest costs. If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses, or if acquired businesses perform poorly, then our business and financial results may suffer. It is possible that the businesses we have acquired and businesses that we acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected. If that happens, there may be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons, including:  we may have to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to acquired businesses;  we may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from our acquisitions;  we may have to write off goodwill or other intangible assets; and  we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions. If we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates and successfully complete acquisitions, our growth and our financial results may be adversely affected. Our growth has depended in part on our ability to acquire similar or complementary businesses on favorable terms. This growth strategy is subject to a number of risks that could adversely affect our business and financial results, including:  we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms;  we may face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers, some of whom may have greater resources than us or may be less highly leveraged, or from the possibility of an acquisition target pursuing an initial public offering of its stock;  we may have to incur additional debt to finance future acquisitions as we have done in the past and no assurance can be given as to whether, and on what terms, such additional debt will be available; and  we may find it more difficult or costly to complete acquisitions due to changes in accounting, tax, securities or other regulations. 16 Table of Contents Catastrophic events may disrupt or otherwise adversely affect the markets in which we operate, our business and our profitability. Our business may be adversely affected by a war, terrorist attack, natural disaster or other catastrophe. A catastrophic event could have a direct negative impact on us or an indirect impact on us by, for example, affecting our customers, the financial markets or the overall economy. The potential for a direct impact is due primarily to our significant investment in our infrastructure. Although we maintain redundant facilities and have contingency plans in place to protect against both man-made and natural threats, it is impossible to fully anticipate and protect against all potential catastrophes. Despite our preparations, a security breach, criminal act, military action, power or communication failure, flood, severe storm or the like could lead to service interruptions and data losses for customers, disruptions to our operations, or damage to our important facilities. The same disasters or circumstances that may lead to our customers requiring access to our availability services may negatively impact our own ability to provide such services. Our three largest availability services facilities are particularly important, and a major disruption at one or more of those facilities could disrupt or otherwise impair our ability to provide services to our availability services customers. If any of these events happen, we may be exposed to unexpected liability, our customers may leave, our reputation may be tarnished, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Our application service provider systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect our reputation and our business. Our application service provider systems maintain and process confidential data on behalf of our customers, some of which is critical to their business operations. For example, our trading, treasury and risk management systems maintain account and trading information for our customers and their clients, and our benefit administration and insurance systems maintain investor account information for retirement plans, insurance policies and mutual funds. There is no guarantee that the systems and procedures that we maintain to protect against unauthorized access to such information are adequate to protect against all security breaches. If our application service provider systems are disrupted or fail for any reason, or if our systems or facilities are infiltrated or damaged by unauthorized persons, our customers could experience data loss, financial loss, harm to reputation and significant business interruption. If that happens, we may be exposed to unexpected liability, our customers may leave, our reputation may be tarnished, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Because the sales cycle for our software is typically lengthy and unpredictable, our results may fluctuate from period to period. Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and be difficult to predict in a particular period due to the timing and magnitude of software sales. We offer a number of our software solutions on a license basis, which means that the customer has the right to run the software on its own computers. The customer usually makes a significant up-front payment to license software, which we generally recognize as revenue when the license contract is signed and the software is delivered. The size of the up-front payment often depends on a number of factors that are different for each customer, such as the number of customer locations, users or accounts. As a result, the sales cycle for a software license may be lengthy and take unexpected turns. Thus, it is difficult to predict when software sales will occur or how much revenue they will generate. Since there are few incremental costs associated with software sales, our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing and magnitude of software sales. Rapid changes in technology and our customers businesses could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our business may suffer if we do not successfully adapt our products and services to changes in technology and changes in our customers businesses. These changes can occur rapidly and at unpredictable intervals and we 17 Table of Contents cannot assure you that we will be able to respond adequately. If we do not successfully update and integrate our products and services to adapt to these changes, or if we do not successfully develop new products and services needed by our customers to keep pace with these changes, then our business and financial results may suffer. Our ability to keep up with technology and business changes is subject to a number of risks, including:  we may find it difficult or costly to update our products and services and to develop new products fast enough to meet our customers needs;  we may find it difficult or costly to make some features of our products and services work effectively and securely over the Internet;  we may find it difficult or costly to integrate more of our FS solutions;  we may find it difficult or costly to update our products and services to keep pace with business, regulatory and other developments in the financial services industry, where many of our customers operate; and  we may find it difficult or costly to update our services to keep pace with advancements in hardware, software and telecommunications technology. Some technological changes, such as advancements that have facilitated the ability of our AS customers to develop their own internal solutions, may render some of our products and services less valuable or eventually obsolete. In addition, because of ongoing, rapid technological changes, the useful lives of some technology assets have become shorter and customers are therefore replacing these assets more often. As a result, our customers are increasingly expressing a preference for contracts with shorter terms, which could make our revenue less predictable in the future. Customers taking their availability solutions in-house may continue to create pressure on our organic revenue growth rate. Our AS solutions allow customers to leverage our significant infrastructure and take advantage of our experience, technology expertise, resource management capabilities and vendor neutrality. Technological advances in recent years have significantly reduced the cost yet not the complexity of developing in-house solutions. Some customers, especially among the very largest having significant IT resources, prefer to develop and maintain their own in-house availability solutions, which can result in a loss of revenue from those customers. If this trend continues or worsens, there will be continued pressure on our organic revenue growth rate. The trend toward information availability solutions utilizing more single customer dedicated resources likely will lower our overall operating margin rate over time. In the information availability services industry, especially among our more sophisticated customers, there is an increasing preference for solutions that utilize some level of dedicated resources, such as blended advanced recovery services and always on production services. The primary reason for this trend is that adding dedicated resources, although more costly, provides greater control, reduces data loss and facilitates quicker responses to business interruptions. Advanced recovery services often result in greater use of both shared and dedicated resources and, therefore, typically generate appreciably higher revenue with only a modest increase in capital expenditures and a modest decrease in operating margin rate. Production or managed services require significant dedicated resources and, therefore, generally produce even higher revenue at an appropriately lower operating margin rate. Our brokerage operations are highly regulated and are riskier than our other businesses. Organizations like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) can, among other things, fine, censure, issue cease-and-desist orders and suspend or expel a 18 Table of Contents broker/dealer or any of its officers or employees for failures to comply with the many laws and regulations that govern brokerage operations. Our ability to comply with these laws and regulations is largely dependent on our establishment, maintenance and enforcement of an effective brokerage compliance program. Our failure to establish, maintain and enforce proper brokerage compliance procedures, even if unintentional, could subject us to significant losses, lead to disciplinary or other actions, and tarnish our reputation. Regulations affecting the brokerage industry, in particular with respect to active traders, may change, which could adversely affect our financial results. We are exposed to certain risks due to the trading activities of our customers and professional traders of our brokerage operations. If customers or professional traders fail to pay for securities they buy, or fail to cover their short sales, or fail to repay margin loans we make to them, then we may suffer losses, and these losses may be disproportionate to the relatively modest revenue and profit contributions of this business. In our other businesses, we generally can disclaim liability for trading losses that may be caused by our software, but in our brokerage operations, we cannot limit our liability for trading losses even when we are not at fault. We could lose revenue due to fiscal funding or termination for convenience clauses in certain customer contracts, especially in our HE and PS businesses. Certain of our customer contracts, particularly those with governments, institutions of higher education and school districts, may be partly or completely terminated by the customer due to budget cuts or sometimes for any reason at all. These types of clauses are often called fiscal funding or termination for convenience clauses. If a customer exercises one of these clauses, the customer would be obligated to pay for the services we performed up to the date of exercise, but would not have to pay for any further services. While we have not been materially affected by exercises of these clauses in the past, we may be in the future. If customers that collectively represent a substantial portion of our revenue were to invoke the fiscal funding or termination for convenience clauses of their contracts, our future business and results of operations could be adversely affected. If we fail to comply with government regulations in connection with our providing technology services to certain financial institutions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Because we act as a third-party service provider to financial institutions and provide mission-critical applications for many financial institutions that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), we are subject to examination by the member agencies of the FFIEC. More specifically, we are a Multi-Regional Data Processing Servicer of the FFIEC because we provide mission critical applications for financial institutions from several data centers located in different geographic regions. As a result, the FFIEC conducts periodic reviews of certain of our operations in order to identify existing or potential risks associated with our operations that could adversely affect the financial institutions to whom we provide services, evaluate our risk management systems and controls, and determine our compliance with applicable laws that affect the services we provide to financial institutions. In addition to examining areas such as our management of technology, data integrity, information confidentiality and service availability, the reviews also assess our financial stability. Our incurrence of significant debt in connection with the Transaction increases the risk of an FFIEC agency review determining that our financial stability has been weakened. A sufficiently unfavorable review from the FFIEC could result in our financial institution customers not being allowed to use our technology services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. If we are unable to retain or attract customers, our business and financial results will be adversely affected. If we are unable to keep existing customers satisfied, sell additional products and services to existing customers or attract new customers, then our business and financial results may suffer. A variety of factors could affect our ability to successfully retain and attract customers, including the level of demand for our products and services, the level of customer spending for information technology, the level of competition from customers that 19 Table of Contents develop their own solutions internally and from other vendors, the quality of our customer service, our ability to update our products and develop new products and services needed by customers, and our ability to integrate and manage acquired businesses. Our services revenue, which has been largely recurring in nature, comes from the sale of our products and services under fixed-term contracts. We do not have a unilateral right to extend these contracts when they expire. If customers cancel or refuse to renew their contracts, or if customers reduce the usage levels or asset values under their contracts, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. If we fail to retain key employees, our business may be harmed. Our success depends on the skill, experience and dedication of our employees. If we are unable to retain and attract sufficiently experienced and capable personnel, especially in product development, sales and management, our business and financial results may suffer. For example, if we are unable to retain and attract a sufficient number of skilled technical personnel, our ability to develop high quality products and provide high quality customer service may be impaired. Experienced and capable personnel in the technology industry remain in high demand, and there is continual competition for their talents. When talented employees leave, we may have difficulty replacing them, and our business may suffer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and attract the personnel that we need. We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally. During 2007, approximately 29% of our revenue was generated outside the United States. Approximately 81% of this revenue was from customers located in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. Over the past few years we have expanded our support operations in India and acquired businesses in China and Singapore, in an effort to increase our presence throughout Asia Pacific. Because we sell our services outside the United States, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Accordingly, our business and financial results could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors, including:  changes in a specific countrys or regions political and cultural climate or economic condition;  unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements;  difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;  inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries;  trade-protection measures, import or export licensing requirements such as Export Administration Regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Commerce and fines, penalties or suspension or revocation of export privileges;  the effects of applicable foreign tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences; and  significant adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The private equity firms that acquired the company control us and may have conflicts of interest with us. Investment funds associated with Bain Capital Partners, The Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs & Co., Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Providence Equity Partners, Silver Lake and Texas Pacific Group (collectively, the Sponsors) indirectly own, through their ownership in our top-tier parent companies, a substantial portion of our capital stock. As a result, the Sponsors have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction regardless of whether noteholders believe that any such transaction is in their own best interests. For example, the Sponsors could cause us to make acquisitions or pay dividends that increase the amount of indebtedness that is secured or that is senior to the senior subordinated notes offered hereby or to sell assets. 20 Table of Contents Additionally, the Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. One or more of the Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as investment funds associated with or designated by the Sponsors continue to indirectly own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, the Sponsors will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. If we are unable to protect our proprietary technologies and defend infringement claims, we could lose one of our competitive advantages and our business could be adversely affected. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary products and services and to defend against infringement claims. If we are unable to do so, our business and financial results may suffer. To protect our proprietary technology, we rely upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret law, confidentiality restrictions in contracts with employees, customers and others, software security measures, and registered copyrights and patents. Despite our efforts to protect the proprietary technology, unauthorized persons may be able to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise use some of our technology. It also is possible that others will develop and market similar or better technology to compete with us. Furthermore, existing patent, copyright and trade secret laws may afford only limited protection, and the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary technology as well as United States law. For these reasons, we may have difficulty protecting our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use. If any of these events happens, there could be a material adverse effect on the value of our proprietary technology and on our business and financial results. In addition, litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology. This type of litigation is often costly and time-consuming, with no assurance of success. The legal framework for software and business method patents is rapidly evolving. Some of our competitors may have been more aggressive than us in applying for or obtaining patent protection for innovative proprietary technologies both in the United States and internationally. There can be no assurance that in the future third parties will not assert infringement claims against us (as they have already done in the past) and preclude us from using a technology in our products or require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on terms that are not favorable to us, or force us to engage in costly infringement litigation, which could result in us paying monetary damages or being forced to redesign our products to avoid infringement. Additionally, our licenses and service agreements with our customers generally provide that we will defend and indemnify them for claims against them relating to our alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties with respect to our products or services. We might have to defend or indemnify our customers to the extent they are subject to these types of claims. Any of these claims may be difficult and costly to defend and may lead to unfavorable judgments or settlements, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial results. For these reasons, we may find it difficult or costly to add or retain important features in our products and services. Defects, design errors or security flaws in our products could harm our reputation and expose us to potential liability. Most of our products are very complex software systems that are regularly updated. No matter how careful the design and development, complex software often contains errors and defects when first introduced and when major new updates or enhancements are released. If errors or defects are discovered in our current or future products, we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner, if at all. In our development of updates and enhancements to our products, we may make a major design error that makes the product operate incorrectly or less efficiently. In addition, certain of our products include security features that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of customer data. Despite these security features, our products and systems, and our customers systems may be vulnerable to break-ins and similar problems caused by third parties, such as hackers bypassing firewalls 21 Table of Contents and misappropriating confidential information. Such break-ins or other disruptions could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and those of our customers, subject us to liability and tarnish our reputation. We may need to expend significant capital resources in order to eliminate or work around errors, defects, design errors or security problems. Any one of these problems in our products may result in the loss of or a delay in market acceptance of our products, the diversion of development resources, a lower rate of license renewals or upgrades and damage to our reputation, and in turn may increase service and warranty costs. A material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse affect on us. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including managements assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Risks Relating to the Notes We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The senior secured credit facilities and the indentures under which the notes are issued restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. See Description of Other IndebtednessSenior Credit Facilities, Description of Senior Notes and Description of Senior Subordinated Notes. Despite our current leverage, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes or the senior subordinated notes, the holders 22 Table of Contents of that additional debt will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes, respectively, in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of us. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify. Your right to receive payments on each series of notes is effectively junior to those lenders who have a security interest in our assets. Our obligations under the notes and our guarantors obligations under their guarantees of the notes are unsecured, but our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes and each guarantors obligations under their respective guarantees of the senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our domestic tangible and, in the case of the senior secured credit facilities, intangible assets, including the stock of most of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries, and the assets and a portion of the stock of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. If we are declared bankrupt or insolvent, or if we default under our senior secured credit agreement, the lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay such indebtedness, the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of the notes, even if an event of default exists under the indentures governing the notes offered hereby at such time. Furthermore, if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor under the notes, then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the notes automatically and immediately upon such sale. In any such event, because the notes will not be secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors, it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which your claims could be satisfied or, if any assets remained, they might be insufficient to satisfy your claims fully. See Description of Other Indebtedness. As of December 31, 2007, we had $4,874 million of senior secured indebtedness (including $500 million face amount of our senior secured notes that are recorded at $470 million), all of which was indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes and which does not include availability of $941 million under our revolving credit facility after giving effect to certain outstanding letters of credit. The indentures governing the notes offered hereby permit us and our restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including senior secured indebtedness. Claims of noteholders will be structurally subordinate to claims of creditors of all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and some of our U.S. subsidiaries because they will not guarantee the notes. The notes will not be guaranteed by any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, our less than wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries, our special purpose finance subsidiaries that participate in the receivables facility or certain other U.S. subsidiaries. Accordingly, claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinate to the claims of creditors of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors. All obligations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to us or a guarantor of the notes. Based on our historical records, our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $1.61 billion, or 33%, of our total revenue, and approximately $230 million, or 18%, of our total EBITDA, in each case for the year ended December 31, 2007, and approximately $3.37 billion, or 23%, of our total assets, and approximately $1.41 billion, or 12%, of our total liabilities, in each case as of December 31, 2007. Your right to receive payments on the senior subordinated notes will be junior to the rights of the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities and all of our other senior debt and any of our future senior indebtedness. The senior subordinated notes will be general unsecured obligations that will be junior in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 23 Table of Contents $6,515 million of senior indebtedness (including $500 million face amount of our senior secured notes that are recorded at $470 million). An additional $941 million is available to be drawn under our revolving credit facility after giving effect to certain outstanding letters of credit. We may not pay principal, premium, if any, interest or other amounts on account of the senior subordinated notes in the event of a payment default or certain other defaults in respect of certain of our senior indebtedness, including debt under the senior secured credit facilities, unless the senior indebtedness has been paid in full or the default has been cured or waived. In addition, in the event of certain other defaults with respect to the senior indebtedness, we may not be permitted to pay any amount on account of the senior subordinated notes for a designated period of time. Because of the subordination provisions in the senior subordinated notes, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution, our assets will not be available to pay obligations under the senior subordinated notes until we have made all payments in cash on our senior indebtedness. We cannot assure you that sufficient assets will remain after all these payments have been made to make any payments on the senior subordinated notes, including payments of principal or interest when due. If we default on our obligations to pay our indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the notes. Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the senior secured credit agreement, that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness, could prevent us from paying principal, premium, if any, and interest on the notes and substantially decrease the market value of the notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness (including covenants in our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing the notes offered hereby), we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness, including our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing the notes offered hereby. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our senior secured credit facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our senior secured credit agreement, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control. Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The source of funds for any such purchase of the notes will be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the notes that are tendered upon a change of control. Further, we will be contractually restricted under the terms of our senior secured credit agreement from repurchasing all of the notes tendered by holders upon a change of control. Accordingly, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to purchase the notes unless we are able to refinance or obtain waivers under our senior secured credit agreement. Our failure to repurchase the notes upon a change of control would cause a default under the indentures governing the notes offered hereby and a cross-default under the senior secured credit agreement. The senior secured credit agreement also provides that a change of control will be a default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. 24 Table of Contents The lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantors under the senior secured credit agreement in a variety of circumstances, which will cause those guarantors to be released from their guarantees of the notes. While any obligations under the senior secured credit facilities remain outstanding, any guarantee of the notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the notes or the trustee under the indentures governing the notes offered hereby, at the discretion of lenders under the senior secured credit facilities, if the related guarantor is no longer a guarantor of obligations under the senior secured credit facilities or any other indebtedness. See Description of Senior Notes and Description of Senior Subordinated Notes. The lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantees under the senior secured credit facilities in a variety of circumstances. You will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of noteholders. Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and the related guarantees of the notes, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes. Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the notes and the incurrence of the related guarantees. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the notes or related guarantees could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if (1) we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, issued the notes or incurred the related guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (2) we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the notes or incurring the related guarantees and, in the case of (2) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof:  we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the related guarantees;  the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the related guarantees left us or any of the guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business;  we or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or such guarantor would, incur debts beyond our or such guarantors ability to pay as they mature; or  we or any of the guarantors was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against us or such guarantor if, in either case, after final judgment, the judgment is unsatisfied. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the related guarantees was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such related guarantees or further subordinate the notes or such related guarantees to presently existing and future indebtedness of ours or of the related guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to such related guarantees. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries other debt that could result in acceleration of such debt. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A debtor will generally not be considered to have received value in connection with a debt offering if the debtor uses the proceeds of that offering to make a dividend payment or otherwise retire or redeem equity securities issued by the debtor. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that the issuance of the related 25 Table of Contents guarantees would not be further subordinated to our or any of our guarantors other debt. Generally, however, an entity would be considered solvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:  the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets; or  the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or  it could not pay its debts as they become due. Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and there is no assurance that any active trading market will develop for the notes. We do not intend to apply for a listing of the notes on a securities exchange or on any automated dealer quotation system. There is currently no established market for the notes and we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of markets that may develop for the notes, your ability to sell the notes or the price at which you would be able to sell the notes. If such markets were to exist, the notes could trade at prices that may be lower than their principal amount or purchase price depending on many factors, including prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our financial and operating performance and other factors. The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market with respect to the notes. However, these initial purchasers are not obligated to do so, and any market making with respect to the notes may be discontinued at any time without notice. Therefore, we cannot assure you that an active market for the notes will develop or, if developed, that it will continue. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your notes. 26 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which involve risks and uncertainties. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as believes, expects, may, will, should, seeks, approximately, intends, plans, estimates, or anticipates or similar expressions that concern our strategy, plans or intentions. All statements we make relating to estimated and projected earnings, margins, costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results are forward-looking statements. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward-looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments. All of these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those we expected. We derive most of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations (cautionary statements) are disclosed under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this prospectus, including, without limitation, in conjunction with the forward-looking statements included in this prospectus. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements. Some of the factors that we believe could affect our results include:  our substantial indebtedness following consummation of the Transaction described in this prospectus;  certain covenants in our debt documents following the consummation of the Transaction described in this prospectus;  general economic and market conditions;  the condition of the financial services industry, including the effect of any further consolidation among financial services firms;  the integration of acquired businesses, the performance of acquired businesses and the prospects for future acquisitions;  the effect of war, terrorism, natural disasters or other catastrophic events;  the effect of disruptions to our systems and infrastructure;  the timing and magnitude of software sales;  the timing and scope of technological advances;  customers taking their information availability solutions in-house;  the trend in information availability toward solutions utilizing more dedicated resources;  the market and credit risks associated with clearing broker operations;  the ability to retain and attract customers and key personnel;  risks relating to the foreign countries where we transact business;  the ability to obtain patent protection and avoid patent-related liabilities in the context of a rapidly developing legal framework for software and business-method patents; and  the other factors set forth under Risk Factors. We caution you that the foregoing list of important factors may not contain all of the material factors that are important to you. In addition, in light of these risks and uncertainties, the matters referred to in the forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus may not in fact occur. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any written or oral forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. 27 Table of Contents THE TRANSACTION On March 27, 2005, Solar Capital Corp., a Delaware corporation (Solar Capital) formed by investment funds associated with Bain Capital Partners, The Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs & Co., Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Providence Equity Partners, Silver Lake and Texas Pacific Group (collectively, the Sponsors), entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement) with SunGard Data Systems Inc. pursuant to which Solar Capital merged with and into SunGard Data Systems Inc. (the Merger). As a result of the Merger, investment funds associated with or designated by the Sponsors, certain co-investors and certain members of our management own SunGard Data Systems Inc. At the effective time of the Merger, each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger (other than shares held in treasury, shares held by Solar Capital or any of our respective subsidiaries, or shares as to which a stockholder has properly exercised appraisal rights) was cancelled and converted into the right to receive $36.00 in cash. The purchase of the company by the Investors (as defined below) was financed by borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, the funding under our receivables facility, the original issuance of the notes and the Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2013 (the floating rate notes) on August 11, 2005, the equity investment and participation described below and cash on hand. Certain of our executive officers and members of senior management agreed to participate in the equity of SunGard Capital Corp. and SunGard Capital Corp. II (collectively, Equity-Issuing Parent Companies) in connection with the Transaction. These executive officers and members of senior management are referred to in this prospectus as the senior management participants. Other of our managers participate in the equity of our Equity-Issuing Parent Companies through continued option ownership or other means. Together, these managers and the senior management participants are referred to in this prospectus as the management participants. The aggregate value of the equity participation by the management participants to partially fund the Merger Consideration was approximately $164 million on a pre-tax basis. Investment funds associated with or designated by the Sponsors invested approximately $3,101 million in equity securities of Solar Capital or our Equity-Issuing Parent Companies as part of the Transaction. Certain other investors (the Co-Investors, and together with investment funds associated with or designated by the Sponsors and the management participants, the Investors), also invested an aggregate of approximately $339 million of equity in Solar Capital or our Equity-Issuing Parent Companies as part of the Transaction. The Merger was approved at the SunGard Data Systems Inc. annual meeting held on July 28, 2005 by our stockholders holding at least a majority of our common stock outstanding. The Merger became effective upon the closing of the Transaction on August 11, 2005. The original issuance of the notes and the floating rate notes on August 11, 2005, the initial borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, the funding under our receivables facility, the equity investment and participation by the Investors in Solar Capital or our parent companies, the Merger and other related transactions are collectively referred to in this prospectus as the Transaction. For a more complete description of the Transaction, see the table below and Description of Other Indebtedness. Through a series of equity contributions that occurred in connection with the Merger, the Investors indirectly own all of our issued and outstanding capital stock through their ownership of our Equity-Issuing Parent Companies. 28 Table of Contents As set forth in the diagram below, which summarizes our ownership and corporate structure as of December 31, 2007, all of our issued and outstanding capital stock is held by SunGard Holdco LLC. The Co-Investors and investment funds associated with or designated by the Sponsors, indirectly through their ownership interest in SunGard Capital Corp. and SunGard Capital Corp. II, own approximately 82% of the membership interests in SunGard Holdco LLC on a fully-diluted basis. The remainder of the membership interests in SunGard Holdco LLC are held by the management participants indirectly through their ownership interest in SunGard Capital Corp. and SunGard Capital Corp. II. See Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners. SunGard Capital Corp., SunGard Capital Corp. II, SunGard Holding Corp. and SunGard Holdco LLC, which we refer to collectively as our parent companies, were formed for the purpose of consummating the transaction. (1) Represents equity contributed by SunGard Capital Corp. and SunGard Capital Corp. II to SunGard Data Systems Inc. to partially fund the Merger Consideration and includes $3,101 million of cash equity contributed by investment funds associated with or designated by the Sponsors, $339 million of cash equity contributed by the Co-Investors and approximately $164 million, on a pre-tax basis, of equity of management participants in the form of a rollover of their existing equity interests in SunGard and/or cash investment. (2) SunGard Holdco LLC, along with certain wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of SunGard Data Systems Inc., guarantee the senior secured credit facilities. Only wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of SunGard that guarantee the senior secured credit facilities guarantee the notes. (3) Upon the closing of the Transaction, we entered into a $1,000 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a six-year maturity, $149 million of which was borrowed on the closing date of the Transaction. At December 31, 2007, $30 million was outstanding under this facility. (4) Upon the closing of the Transaction, we entered into $4,000 million-equivalent of senior secured term loan facilities, comprised of a $3,685 million facility with SunGard as the borrower and $315 million-equivalent facilities with a newly formed U.K. subsidiary as the borrower, $165 million of which is denominated in euros and $150 million of which is denominated in pounds sterling, with a seven-and-a-half-year maturity. On February 28, 2007, we amended the senior secured credit facilities to, among other things, increase the 29 Table of Contents amount of term loan borrowings of SunGard Data Systems Inc. by $400 million. Additional borrowings were used to redeem our outstanding floating rate notes. (5) The original issuance of the senior notes upon the closing of the Transaction included $400 million of floating rate notes. On March 26, 2007, we redeemed all outstanding floating rate notes in accordance with the indenture governing the senior notes with the proceeds of additional borrowings under the senior secured term loan facilities. (6) Consists of $250 million face amount of 3.75% senior notes due 2009 and $250 million face amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2014. Upon consummation of the Transaction, the senior secured notes became secured on an equal and ratable basis with loans under the senior secured credit facilities to the extent required by the indenture governing the senior secured notes and are guaranteed by all our subsidiaries that guarantee the notes. The senior secured notes are recorded at $470 million as of December 31, 2007 as a result of fair value adjustments related to purchase accounting. The discount of $30 million on the senior secured notes will continue to be amortized into interest expense and added to the recorded amounts over the remaining periods up to their respective maturity dates. (7) Upon the closing of the Transaction, the principal receivables facility, together with a transitional receivables facility, provided for up to $375 million of funding for a period of six years following the closing of the Merger, based, in part, on the amount of eligible receivables. The full amount of the receivables facilities was funded at the closing of the Transaction. In December 2005, the aggregate availability under the principal receivables facility was increased to a maximum amount of $450 million, and the transitional receivables facility was terminated. Because sales of receivables under the receivables facility depend, in part, on the amount of eligible receivables, the amount of available funding under this facility may fluctuate over time. See Description of Other IndebtednessReceivables Facility. The Merger Agreement contains customary seller representations and warranties by the company, customary buyer representations and warranties by Solar Capital and customary covenants and other agreements between Solar Capital and SunGard. The representations and warranties terminated as of the closing of the Merger and a majority of the covenants were satisfied in connection with the closing of the Merger. However, certain obligations remain in effect. The Merger Agreement requires the company to indemnify each present and former director and officer of the company and each subsidiary, in and to the extent of their capacities as such and not as stockholders and/or optionholders of the company or subsidiaries against all losses (including attorneys fees) paid in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the effective date of the Merger) arising out of any action or omission occurring on or before the effective time of the Merger to the same extent as provided in the bylaws of the company. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) the company shall pay reasonable attorneys fees and (ii) the company shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter. Additionally, the company is bound by a covenant that it will not amend, repeal or otherwise modify the provisions with respect to indemnification set forth in the companys charter or bylaws in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of individuals protected thereunder for a period of six years following the effective time of the Merger. The Merger Agreement further requires the company to either (i) cause to be obtained tail insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from the effective time of the Merger with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in amount and scope at least as favorable as the companys policies before the effective date of the Merger for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the effective date of the Merger; or (ii) maintain in effect for six years from the effective time of the Merger, if available, the current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the company with respect to matters occurring prior to the effective date of the Merger. However, in no event is the company required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 250% of annual premiums paid by the company for such insurance immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. In the event of an expiration of the current policies, the company is required to obtain as much coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies to the existing policies for such maximum annual amount in aggregate annual premiums. 30 Table of Contents In addition, the Merger Agreement sets forth various ongoing obligations of the company with respect to its employees. Further, the company must honor all contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments of the company and its subsidiaries applicable to current or former employees or directors of the company or its subsidiaries that were in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and any change in control or employment agreements specifically identified. The company is also obligated to maintain without modification the SunGard Severance Pay Plan, dated as of November 2002, during the period from the effective time of the Merger. In connection with the Merger, we (i) entered into new senior secured credit facilities, consisting of $4,000 million-equivalent term loan facilities, comprised of a $3,685 million facility with SunGard as the borrower and $315 million-equivalent facilities with a newly formed U.K. subsidiary as the borrower, $165 million of which is denominated in euros and $150 million of which is denominated in pounds sterling, and a $1,000 million revolving credit facility ($941 million of which was available at December 31, 2007, after giving effect to certain outstanding letters of credit), (ii) issued $3,000 million aggregate principal amount of the originally issued notes and (iii) entered into a receivables facility initially totaling up to $375 million. In December 2005, the aggregate availability under the receivables facility was increased to $450 million. On February 28, 2007, we amended the senior secured credit facilities to, among other things, increase the amount of term loan borrowings of SunGard Data Systems Inc. by $400 million. On March 26, 2007, we used the additional borrowings to redeem all outstanding floating rate notes issued in connection with the Merger. See Description of Other Indebtedness. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the senior management participants entered into agreements with the Sponsors, pursuant to which they agreed, among other things, to invest approximately $109.8 million of equity on a pre-tax basis in the aggregate in Solar Capital or our Equity-Issuing Parent Companies. Such agreements are referred to as the management agreements. These management agreements also related to the grant of new equity to such senior management participants under a new equity plan of us or our Equity-Issuing Parent Companies and new employment agreements entered into in connection with the Merger. Other of our managers who are not senior management participants participate in the equity of our Equity-Issuing Parent Companies through continued option ownership or other means. The aggregate value of the equity participation by the management participants to partially fund the Merger Consideration was $164 million on a pre-tax basis. 31 Table of Contents Sources and Uses The sources and uses of the funds for the Transaction are shown in the table below.

During 2004, we recorded merger costs of $6 million consisting of $5 million of accounting, investment banking, and legal and other costs associated with the abandoned spin-off of our availability services business and $1 million in net facility shut-down and severance costs related to previous acquisitions. During the period from January 1 through August 10, 2005, we recorded 34 Table of Contents merger costs of $121 million, primarily $59 million of accounting, investment banking, legal and other costs associated with the Transaction and a non-cash charge for stock compensation of approximately $59 million resulting from the acceleration of stock options and restricted stock. During the period from August 11 through December 31, 2005, we recorded merger costs of $18 million consisting primarily of payroll taxes and certain compensation expenses related to the Transaction. (2) During 2003, we recorded other expense of $3 million related to a $1 million loss on foreign currency purchased to fund a foreign acquisition, and a $2 million loss representing our share of the net loss of an unconsolidated subsidiary. During 2004, we recorded other income of $78 million relating to the sale of Brut to The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. During the period from August 11 through December 31, 2005, we recorded $17 million related to the loss on sale of the receivables and discount on retained interests in connection with the receivables facility. During 2006, we recorded $29 million related to the loss on sale of the receivables and discount on retained interests in connection with the receivables facility. During 2007, we recorded $29 million related to the loss on sale of the receivables and discount on retained interests in connection with the receivables facility and $28 million associated with the early retirement of the $400 million of senior floating rate notes due 2013, of which $19 million represented the retirement premium paid to the noteholders. (3) EBITDA is calculated as follows: Predecessor Successor Year Ended December 31, January 1 through August 10, 2005 August 11 through December 31, 2005 Year Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2006 2007 (Dollars in millions) Net income $ 370 $ 454 $ 146 $ (29 ) $ (118 ) $ (60 ) Interest expense, net 5 21 8 242 642 626 Taxes 245 307 142 (33 ) (21 ) (3 ) Depreciation and amortization 312 337 225 236 637 689 EBITDA $ 932 $ 1,119 $ 521 $ 416 $ 1,140 $ 1,252 EBITDA, a measure used by management to measure operating performance, is defined as net income plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for managements discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. Management believes EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends because EBITDA can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. In addition, EBITDA provides more comparability between the historical results of SunGard and results that reflect purchase accounting and the new capital structure. Management compensates for the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures by using them to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations of EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. (4) Capital expenditures represent net cash paid for property and equipment as well as software and other assets. (5) For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of income before income taxes plus fixed charges. Fixed charges include: interest expense, whether expensed or capitalized; amortization of debt issuance cost; and the portion of rental expense representative of the interest factor. Earnings for the period August 11 to December 31, 2005, for 2006 and 2007 were inadequate to cover fixed charges by $62 million, $139 million and $63 million, respectively. 35 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are one of the worlds leading software and IT services companies. We provide software and processing solutions to institutions throughout the financial services industry, higher education, and the public sector; and we help enterprises of all types to maintain the continuity of their business through information availability services. We support more than 25,000 customers in over 50 countries, including the worlds 50 largest financial services companies. We operate our business in four segments: Financial Systems (FS), Higher Education (HE), Public Sector (PS) and Availability Services (AS). Our FS segment primarily serves financial services companies, corporate and government treasury departments and energy companies. Our HE segment primarily serves higher education institutions. Our PS segment primarily serves state and local governments and not-for-profit organizations. Our AS segment serves IT-dependent companies across virtually all industries. SunGard Data Systems Inc. (SunGard) was acquired on August 11, 2005 by a consortium of private equity investment funds associated with Bain Capital Partners, The Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs & Co., Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Providence Equity Partners, Silver Lake and Texas Pacific Group (the Transaction). SunGard is a wholly owned subsidiary of SunGard Holdco LLC, which is wholly owned by SunGard Holding Corp., which is wholly owned by SunGard Capital Corp. II, which is a subsidiary of SunGard Capital Corp. The term Equity-Issuing Parent Companies collectively refers to SunGard Capital Corp. and SunGard Capital Corp. II, as used herein. All of these companies were formed for the purpose of facilitating the Transaction. In FS, we primarily serve financial services institutions through a broad range of complementary software solutions that process their investment and trading transactions. The principal purpose of most of these systems is to automate the many detailed processes associated with trading securities, managing investment portfolios and accounting for investment assets. In HE, we primarily provide software, strategic and systems integration consulting, and technology management services to colleges and universities. HE solutions include administration, advancement, IT management, performance analytics, enrollment management, academic performance and strategic planning. In PS, we primarily provide software and processing solutions designed to meet the specialized needs of local, state, federal and central governments, public safety and justice agencies, public schools, utilities, non-profits, and other public sector institutions. Our PS solutions support a range of specialized enterprise resource planning and administrative solutions. In AS, we help our customers maintain access to the information and computer systems they need to run their businesses by providing them with cost-effective resources to keep their IT systems reliable and secure. We offer a complete range of availability services from always ready standby solutions to always on production services. We also provide professional services to help our customers design, implement and maintain the ways they access critical information. The following discussion includes historical and certain forward-looking information that should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes and the discussion above of certain risks and uncertainties (see Risk Factors) that could cause future operating results to differ materially from historical results or the expected results indicated by forward-looking statements. Use of Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of 36 Table of Contents assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Those estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We review our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and revise them when necessary. Actual results may differ from the original or revised estimates. A summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A description of the most critical policies follows. Our management has discussed the critical accounting policies described below with our audit committee. Intangible Assets and Purchase Accounting Purchase accounting requires that all assets and liabilities be recorded at fair value on the acquisition date, including identifiable intangible assets separate from goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets include customer base (which includes customer contracts and relationships), software and trade name. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. For the Transaction and for other significant acquisitions, we obtain independent appraisals and valuations of the intangible (and certain tangible) assets acquired and certain assumed obligations. The estimated fair values and useful lives of identified intangible assets are based on many factors, including estimates and assumptions of future operating performance and cash flows of the acquired business, the nature of the business acquired, the specific characteristics of the identified intangible assets, and our historical experience and that of the acquired business. The estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair values and useful lives of identified intangible assets could change due to numerous factors, including product demand, market conditions, technological developments, economic conditions and competition. The carrying values and useful lives for amortization of identified intangible assets are reviewed on an ongoing basis, and any resulting changes in estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. At least annually, we compare the carrying value of our reporting units to their estimated fair value. If the carrying value is greater than the respective estimated fair value, we then determine if the goodwill is impaired, and whether some or all of the goodwill should be written off as a charge to operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. The estimate of fair value requires various assumptions including the use of projections of future cash flows and discount rates that reflect the risks associated with achieving the future cash flows. Changes in the underlying business could affect these estimates, which in turn could affect the fair value of the reporting unit. In connection with certain acquisitions, we have accrued the estimated costs of closing certain facilities. Costs for closing leased facilities are estimated based on the condition and remaining lease term of each facility, the expected closure date and an assessment of relevant market conditions, including an estimate of any sub-lease rental income we can reasonably expect to obtain at the time of the acquisition. Costs for closing owned facilities are based on the difference between the estimated net proceeds from a sale of the facility and its carrying value. These estimates are based on an assessment of the condition of the facility, its location and relevant market conditions. The estimated cost of closing our existing facilities is included in merger costs, and the estimated cost of closing acquired facilities is included in goodwill. Merger costs or goodwill could change due to the finalization of plans for closing facilities and completion of valuations, as well as the settlement of lease obligations or sale of owned facilities. A change in market conditions after the acquisition date could change the estimated costs for closing facilities and may result in a charge or credit to merger costs, which could have a material effect on our financial results. Revenue Recognition We generate services revenue from availability services, processing services, software maintenance and rentals, professional services and broker/dealer fees. All services revenue is recorded as the services are provided based on the fair value of each element. Fair value is determined based on the sales price of each element when sold separately. Most AS services revenue consists of fixed monthly fees based upon the specific computer 37 Table of Contents configuration or business process for which the service is being provided, and the related costs are incurred ratably over the contract period. When recovering from an interruption, customers generally are contractually obligated to pay additional fees, which typically cover our incremental costs of supporting customers during recoveries. FS services revenue includes monthly fees, which may include a fixed minimum fee and/or variable fees based on a measure of volume or activity, such as the number of accounts, trades or transactions, users or the number of hours of service. For fixed-fee professional services contracts, services revenue is recorded based upon the estimated percentage of completion, measured by the actual number of hours incurred divided by the total estimated number of hours for the project. When contracts include both professional services and software and there are significant program modifications or customization, installation, systems integration or related services, the professional services and license revenue is combined and recorded based upon the estimated percentage of completion, measured in the manner described above. Changes in the estimated costs or hours to complete the contract and losses, if any, are reflected in the period during which the change or loss becomes known. License fees result from contracts that permit the customer to use our software products at its site. Generally, these contracts are multiple-element arrangements since they usually provide for professional services and ongoing software maintenance. In these instances, license fees are recognized upon the signing of the contract and delivery of the software if the license fee is known, collection is probable, and there is sufficient evidence of the fair value of each undelivered element. Revenue is recorded when billed when customer payments are extended beyond normal billing terms, or at acceptance when there is significant acceptance, technology or service risk. Revenue also is recorded over the contract period in those instances where the software is bundled together with computer equipment or other post-delivery services, and there is not sufficient evidence of the fair value of each element. We believe that our revenue recognition practices comply with the complex and evolving rules governing revenue recognition. Future interpretations of existing accounting standards, new standards or changes in our business practices could result in changes in our revenue recognition accounting policies that could have a material effect on our financial results. Accounting for Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Considerable judgment is required in assessing and estimating these amounts and differences between the actual outcome of these future tax consequences and our estimates could have a material effect on our financial results. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation As of the date of the Transaction (August 11, 2005), the company adopted SFAS No. 123R (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R). Using the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the appropriate service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards requires considerable judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock options, expected volatility of our stock price, and the number of awards expected to be forfeited. In addition, for stock-based awards where vesting is dependent upon achieving certain operating performance goals, we estimate the likelihood of achieving the performance goals. Differences between actual results and these estimates could have a material effect on our financial results. A deferred income tax asset is recorded over the vesting period as stock compensation expense is recorded. Our ability to use the deferred tax asset is ultimately based on the actual value of the stock-based award upon exercise. If the actual value is lower than the fair value determined on the date of grant, then there could be an income tax expense for the portion of the deferred tax asset that cannot be used, which could have a material effect on our financial results. 38 Table of Contents Results of Operations We evaluate performance of our segments based on operating results before interest, income taxes, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock compensation and certain other costs (see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Although SunGard continued as the same legal entity after the Transaction, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this document relate to periods that precede and succeed the Transaction and are labeled Predecessor and Successor, respectively. We use the company to refer to the operations of SunGard and subsidiaries for both periods and have prepared our discussion of the results of operations by comparing the mathematical combination of the periods, without pro forma adjustments, of the Successor and Predecessor periods in the year ended December 31, 2005 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Although this presentation does not comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we believe it provides a meaningful method of comparison. 39 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain amounts included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and the relative percentage that those amounts represent to consolidated revenue (unless otherwise indicated).

Financial Systems: The FS operating margin was 21% for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 20% for the prior year period. The $32 million increase in software license fees, improvement in the operating contribution from the growth in professional services revenue and operating leverage from other services revenue were partially offset by the impact of recently acquired businesses. The most important factors affecting the FS operating margin are:  the operating margins of recently acquired businesses, which tend to be lower at the outset and improve over a number of years,  the level of IT spending and its impact on the overall demand for professional services and software license sales,  the rate and value of contract renewals, new contract signings and contract terminations,  continued pressure on pricing both in contract renewals and new contract signings,  the level of trading volumes, and  the overall condition of the financial services industry and the effect of any further consolidation among financial services firms. Higher Education: The HE operating margin was 26% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 24% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Income from operations increased $25 million in 2007 primarily due to a $15 million increase in resale fees, improved operating profit contribution from services revenue, and a $4 million increase in software license fees. The most important factors affecting the HE operating margin are:  the rate and value of contract renewals, new contract signings and contract terminations,  the level of IT spending and its impact on the overall demand for professional services and software license sales, and  continued pressure on pricing both in contract renewals and new contract signings. Public Sector: The PS operating margin was 20% for the year ended December 31, 2007, unchanged from the prior year period. Income from operations increased $5 million in 2007 primarily due to a $3 million increase in software license fees. The most important factors affecting the PS operating margin are:  the rate and value of contract renewals, new contract signings and contract terminations,  the level of IT spending and its impact on the overall demand for professional services and software license sales, and  continued pressure on pricing both in contract renewals and new contract signings. 42 Table of Contents Availability Services: The AS operating margin was 30% for the year ended December 31, 2007, unchanged from the prior year period. Income from operations increased $16 million in 2007 primarily due to improved operating profit contribution. The most important factors affecting the AS operating margin are:  the rate and value of contract renewals, new contract signings and contract terminations,  the timing and magnitude of equipment and facilities expenditures, and  the trend toward availability solutions utilizing more dedicated resources. The margin rate of the AS European business is inherently lower than the margin rate of the North American business due primarily to lower economies of scale in the distinct geographic markets served and, to a lesser extent, a higher percentage of always on solutions. However, the differential in the margins has narrowed over the past several years because of operational improvements in Europe and the growing proportion of always on solutions in North America. Revenue: Total revenue was $4.90 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $4.32 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in total revenue in 2007 is due primarily to organic revenue growth of approximately 11%, with trading volumes of one of our trading systems businesses adding three percentage points to the growth rate and changes in currency exchange rates adding approximately two percentage points overall. Excluding these items, organic growth would have been 6%. Organic revenue is defined as revenue from businesses owned for at least one year and further adjusted for the effects of businesses sold in the previous twelve months. When assessing our financial results, we focus on growth in organic revenue because overall revenue growth is affected by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions and dispositions. Services revenue, which is largely recurring in nature, includes revenue from availability services, processing services, software support and rentals, professional services, broker/dealer fees and hardware rentals. Services revenue increased to $4.36 billion from $3.87 billion, representing approximately 89% of total revenue in 2007 compared to 90% in 2006. The revenue increase of $493 million in 2007 was due to organic revenue growth of $391 million across all segments and the impact of acquired revenue in FS. Professional services revenue was $886 million and $767 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $119 million increase was due primarily to FS organic and acquired revenue. Revenue from license and resale fees was $395 million and $342 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and includes software license revenue of $293 million and $255 million, respectively. Financial Systems: FS revenue was $2.50 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $2.07 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. Organic revenue growth was approximately 17% in 2007, with trading volumes of one of our trading systems businesses adding $121 million or five percentage points to the growth rate, which exceeded our expectations for the year and the future. Excluding this business, organic revenue growth was approximately 12% in 2007. Professional services had the most significant contribution to overall FS growth, having increased $133 million or 29%. Revenue from license and resale fees included software license revenue of $214 million and $182 million, respectively, in 2007 and 2006. 43 Table of Contents Higher Education: HE revenue was $543 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $498 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Services revenue increased $26 million. In 2007, resale fees were $51 million, an increase of $15 million, and software license fees were $47 million, an increase of $4 million. HE organic revenue growth was approximately 9% in 2007. Public Sector: PS revenue was $410 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $395 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 4%, with changes in currency exchange rates adding approximately five percentage points. Organic revenue declined approximately 2%. Software license fees were $28 million in 2007, an increase of $3 million. Availability Services: AS revenue was $1.45 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $1.36 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, a 7% increase. AS organic revenue increased approximately 4% in 2007. In North America revenue grew 4% overall and 1% organically as strong growth in managed services was offset by a net decrease in always ready and advanced recovery services. Revenue in Europe grew 17%, 8% excluding the impact of currency exchange rates. Costs and Expenses: Cost of sales and direct operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained unchanged at 46% for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The increase of $288 million was due primarily to an increase in FS employee-related and consultant expenses supporting increased services revenue and increased costs related to the higher volumes in one of our trading systems businesses. Sales, marketing and administration expenses remained unchanged as a percentage of total revenue at 21% for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The increase of $127 million was due primarily to FS businesses acquired in the last twelve months and an unfavorable arbitration award related to a customer dispute, partially offset by reduced stock compensation expense and an insurance settlement. Because AS product development costs are insignificant, it is more meaningful to measure product development expense as a percentage of revenue from software and processing solutions. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, software development expenses were 8% and 9% of revenue from software and processing solutions, respectively. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue was 5% and 6% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $13 million increase in 2007 was due primarily to capital expenditures supporting AS. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was 9% of total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets increased $39 million in 2007 due primarily to the impact of recent acquisitions and an impairment charge of $10 million. Interest expense was $645 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $656 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease is primarily due to a lower effective interest cost due to the refinancing of our term loan facility in February 2007, partially offset by the additional borrowing on our term loan prior to the early retirement of the senior floating rate notes and an increase in average borrowings under the revolving credit facility. 44 Table of Contents Other expense increased $39 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 due primarily to $28 million of expense associated with the early retirement of the $400 million of senior floating rate notes due 2013, of which $19 million represented the retirement premium paid to noteholders. We believe that our overall effective income tax rate is typically between 38% and 40%. The effective income tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were 5% and 15%, respectively. The lower rates in 2007 and 2006 reflect the combination of our overall net loss in each year, limitations on our ability to utilize foreign tax credits resulting from the large amount of interest expense and, in 2007, changes in enacted tax rates in certain state and foreign jurisdictions. The result is a lower income tax benefit in each of 2007 and 2006 than would otherwise be expected. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Income from Operations: Despite $147 million of incremental amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets resulting from the Transaction (incremental amortization), a $13 million decrease in software license fees and a $9 million increase in non-cash stock compensation cost in 2006, the operating margin of 12% was unchanged from 2005 because 2005 included the following items that did not recur in 2006: $139 million in merger costs, a $21 million reduction in revenue related to purchase accounting adjustments recorded in connection with the Transaction (the deferred revenue adjustment), and an $11 million one-time charge related to the relocation of an AS facility. Financial Systems: The FS operating margin was 20% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 21% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Income from operations increased $18 million in 2006 primarily due to growth in the business as the effect of the 2005 deferred revenue adjustment of $7 million was offset by a $6 million decrease in software license fees. Higher Education: The HE operating margin was 24% for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Despite a $9 million decrease in software license fees, income from operations increased $5 million in 2006 primarily due to a $35 million increase in services revenue and the effect of the 2005 deferred revenue adjustment of $3 million. Public Sector: The PS operating margin was 20% for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Income from operations increased $15 million in 2006 primarily due to the full-year impact of a 2005 acquisition, improved performance, the 2005 deferred revenue adjustment of $3 million and a $2 million increase in software license fees. Availability Services: The AS operating margin was 30% for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Income from operations increased $26 million in 2006 primarily due to a one-time charge of $11 million in 2005 related to the relocation of an AS facility and the 2005 deferred revenue adjustment of $8 million. Revenue: Total revenue was $4.32 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $4.00 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in total revenue in 2006 was due primarily to organic revenue growth. Organic revenue growth was approximately 6% in 2006 compared to approximately 6.5% in 2005. 45 Table of Contents Services revenue increased to $3.87 billion from $3.54 billion, representing approximately 90% of total revenue in 2006 compared to 89% in 2005. The revenue increase of $326 million in 2006 was due to organic revenue growth of $247 million across all segments, the impact of acquired revenue in FS and PS, and the 2005 deferred revenue adjustment. Professional services revenue was $767 million and $644 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $123 million increase was due primarily to FS organic and acquired revenue. Revenue from license and resale fees was $342 million and $345 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and includes software license revenue of $255 million and $266 million, respectively. The decrease in license fees primarily resulted from a $19 million software license backlog at the end of 2004 which was recognized in 2005. Financial Systems: FS revenue was $2.07 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1.91 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005. Services revenue increased $176 million and license and resale fees decreased $7 million. The increase in services revenue is due primarily to organic revenue growth. The decrease in software license fees was across the segment and primarily reflects the impact of $9 million of software license backlog at December 31, 2004 which was recognized as revenue in 2005. Total FS organic revenue increased approximately 7% in 2006, compared to approximately 6% in 2005. Higher Education: HE revenue was $498 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $474 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Services revenue increased $35 million and license and resale fees decreased $11 million. Software license fees were $43 million in 2006, a decrease of $9 million, which primarily reflects the impact of the software license backlog at December 31, 2004 which was recognized as revenue in 2005. HE organic revenue growth was approximately 4% in 2006. Public Sector: PS revenue was $395 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $314 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Services revenue increased $53 million and license and resale fees increased $28 million. Software license fees were $26 million in 2006, an increase of $3 million. Resale fees increased $24 million compared to the prior year due primarily to a business acquired in the first quarter of 2005. PS organic revenue growth was approximately 10% in 2006. Availability Services: AS revenue was $1.36 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 4% increase. AS organic revenue increased approximately 4% in 2006, compared to a 5% increase in 2005. Costs and Expenses: Total costs and expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 88% for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. The increase of $282 million in total costs was primarily due to increased expenses across all segments and to acquired businesses. Total costs and expenses in 2006 include incremental amortization of $148 million while total costs and expenses in 2005 include $139 million in merger costs, both of which relate to the Transaction. 46 Table of Contents Cost of sales and direct operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 46% for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. The increase of $120 million was due primarily to increased costs across all segments, and the increase from acquired PS and FS businesses, offset by a one-time charge in 2005 of $11 million related to the relocation of an AS facility. Sales, marketing and administration expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 21% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 20% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase of $116 million was due primarily to increased costs in FS, to acquired FS businesses and to the increase in non-cash stock compensation of $9 million. Because AS product development costs are insignificant, it is more meaningful to measure product development expense as a percentage of revenue from software and processing solutions. For each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, software development expenses were 9% of revenue from software and processing solutions. Depreciation and amortization was consistent as a percentage of total revenue at 6% for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. The $8 million increase in 2006 was due primarily to the impact of the Transaction as well as from fixed assets acquired in AS. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was 9% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 6% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets increased $168 million in 2006 due to the impact of the Transaction as well as recent acquisitions made by the company. In 2005, we recorded merger costs of $139 million in connection with the Transaction. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense was $656 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $265 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase reflects the full-year impact of the $7.3 billion in debt incurred in connection with the Transaction. Interest income was $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other expense increased $12 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 due primarily to the losses incurred related to the sale of accounts receivable under our accounts receivable securitization program (see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We believe that our overall effective income tax rate is typically between 38% and 40%. The effective income tax rates in 2006 and 2005 were 15% and 48%, respectively. The lower rate in 2006 reflects the combination of our overall net loss and limitations on our ability to utilize foreign tax credits resulting from the large amount of interest expense. The result is a lower income tax benefit in 2006 than would otherwise be expected. The higher effective tax rate in 2005 was due to non-deductible merger costs and, to a lesser extent, repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2007, cash and cash equivalents were $427 million, an increase of $111 million from December 31, 2006. Cash flow from operations was $701 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to cash flow from operations of $491 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in cash flow from operations is due primarily to more cash provided by working capital and the increase in income from operations. Net cash used in investing activities was $564 million in the year ended December 31, 2007. Capital expenditures were $312 million in 2006 and $307 million in 2007. We spent $163 million for ten acquisitions 47 Table of Contents during 2006 and $265 million for eleven acquisitions during 2007, including $161 million for the acquisition of Vericenter in the AS business, where acquisitions tend to be larger and less frequent. In February 2008, we completed 2 acquisitions in our FS segment for aggregate cash paid of approximately $84 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $32 million in 2007 and $48 million in 2006. In February 2007, we amended our Credit Agreement to reduce the effective interest rates on the term loan facility, increase the size of that facility from $4.0 billion to $4.4 billion, extend the maturity by one year and change certain other terms. In March 2007, we used the additional borrowings to redeem the $400 million in aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due 2013. We use interest rate swap agreements to manage the amount of our floating rate debt in order to reduce our exposure to variable rate interest payments associated with the senior secured credit facilities. We pay the counterparty a stream of fixed interest payments for the term of the swap, and in turn, receive variable interest payments based on LIBOR (4.90% at December 31, 2007) from the counterparties. The net receipt or payment from the interest rate swap agreements is included in interest expense. A summary of our interest rate swaps follows: Inception Maturity Notional Amount (in millions) Interest rate paid Interest rate received November 2005 February 2009 $ 800 4.85 % LIBOR February 2006 February 2011 800 5.00 % LIBOR January 2008 February 2011 750 3.17 % LIBOR February 2008 February 2010 750 2.71 % LIBOR Total/Weighted average interest rate $ 3,100 3.96 % At December 31, 2007, contingent purchase price obligations that depend upon the operating performance of certain acquired businesses could total $106 million, of which $41 million could be due in the next 12 months. Of this amount, we currently expect to pay approximately $1 million. We also have outstanding letters of credit and bid bonds that total approximately $43 million. As a result of the Transaction, we are highly leveraged and our debt service requirements are significant. At December 31, 2007, our total indebtedness was $7.49 billion and we had $941 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility, after giving effect to certain outstanding letters of credit. In addition, at December 31, 2007, we had outstanding $441 million under our $450 million off-balance sheet accounts receivable securitization program. At December 31, 2007, our contractual obligations follow (in millions): Total 2008 2009  2010 2011  2012 2013 and After Short-term and long-term debt $ 7,515 $ 55 $ 364 $ 122 $ 6,974 Interest payments (1) 3,459 583 1,142 1,118 616 Operating leases 818 184 256 163 215 Purchase obligations (2) 207 136 65 5 1 $ 11,999 $ 958 $ 1,827 $ 1,408 $ 7,806 (1) Interest payments consist of interest on both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. Variable-rate debt consists primarily of the unhedged portion of the US$ term loan facility (6.90% at December 31, 2007), and the euro denominated portion of the term loan facility ($191 million at 6.73% at December 31, 2007) and the pound sterling denominated portion of the term loan facility ($163 million at 8.30% at December 31, 2007). See 48 Table of Contents Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The swap agreements put in place in January and February 2008 will reduce the amount of interest payments in the table above by $27 million in 2008, $44 million in 2009-2010 and $1 million in 2011. (2) Purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or services. We expect our cash flows from operations, combined with availability under our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program, to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements and capital spending for a period that includes the next 12 months. Depending on market conditions, the company, its Sponsors and their affiliates, may from time to time repurchase debt securities issued by the company, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. The Transaction As a result of the Transaction (August 11, 2005), we are highly leveraged and our debt service requirements are significant. Below is a summary of our debt instruments. Senior Secured Credit Facilities Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate that is the higher of (1) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and (2) the federal funds rate plus 1 / 2 of 1% or (b) LIBOR based on the costs of funds for deposits in the currency of such borrowing for either 30, 60, 90 or 180 days. The applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility may be reduced subject to attaining certain leverage ratios. As of December 31, 2007, we have achieved the leverage ratio necessary to reduce the applicable margin by 0.25% per annum, which will be effective for borrowings under these facilities in March 2008. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the senior secured credit facilities, we pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate is 0.50% per annum and may be reduced subject to attaining certain leverage ratios. All obligations under the senior secured credit facilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by SunGard Holdco LLC and by substantially all domestic, 100% wholly owned subsidiaries. We are required to repay installments on the loans under the term loan facilities in quarterly principal amounts of 0.25% of their funded total principal amount through March 2013, with the remaining amount payable in May 2013, provided, however, that such date will automatically become February 2014 if all the senior notes are extended, renewed or refinanced on or prior to May 15, 2013. The senior secured credit facilities also require us to pay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with excess cash flow and proceeds from certain asset sales, casualty and condemnation events, other borrowings and certain financings under our accounts receivable securitization program. Any required payments would be applied pro rata to the term loan lenders and to installments of the term loan facilities in direct order of maturity. Principal amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due and payable in full at maturity, in August 2011. As of December 31, 2007, we have $941 million available under the revolving credit facility, after giving effect to certain letters of credit. The senior secured credit facilities contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our (and most or all of our subsidiaries) ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue 49 Table of Contents preferred stock, pay dividends and distributions on or repurchase capital stock, create liens on assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, repay subordinated indebtedness, make investments, loans or advances, make capital expenditures, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, amend certain material agreements, change our lines of business, sell assets and engage in mergers or consolidations. In addition, under the senior secured credit facilities, we are required to satisfy certain total leverage and interest coverage ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2007. Senior Notes due 2009 and 2014 On January 15, 2004, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes, of which $250 million are 3.75% notes due in January 2009 and $250 million are 4.875% notes due 2014 (the Senior Notes due 2009 and 2014), which are subject to certain standard covenants. As a result of the Transaction, the Senior Notes due 2009 and 2014 became collateralized on an equal and ratable basis with loans under the senior secured credit facilities and are guaranteed by all subsidiaries that guarantee the senior notes due 2013 and senior subordinated notes due 2015. The Senior Notes due 2009 and 2014 are recorded at $470 million as of December 31, 2007, reflecting the remaining unamortized discount caused by the Transaction. The $30 million discount will be amortized and included in interest expense. Senior Notes due 2013 and Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 The senior notes due 2013 (the senior notes) are senior unsecured obligations that rank senior in right of payment to future debt and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the senior notes, including the senior subordinated notes. The senior notes (i) rank equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt and other obligations that are not, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the senior notes, (ii) are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt, and (iii) are structurally subordinated to all obligations of each subsidiary that is not a guarantor of the senior notes. All obligations under the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all domestic, 100% wholly owned subsidiaries of the company. The senior subordinated notes due 2015 (the senior subordinated notes) are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that are subordinated in right of payment to the existing and future senior debt, including the senior secured credit facilities, the Senior Notes due 2009 and 2014 and the senior notes. The senior subordinated notes (i) rank equally in right of payment to all future senior subordinated debt, (ii) are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt, (iii) are structurally subordinated to all obligations of each subsidiary that is not a guarantor of the senior subordinated notes, and (iv) rank senior in right of payment to all future debt and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the senior subordinated notes. The senior notes and senior subordinated notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at our option, at any time at varying redemption prices that generally include premiums, which are defined in the applicable indentures. In addition, upon a change of control, we are required to make an offer to redeem all of the senior notes and senior subordinated notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indentures governing the senior notes and senior subordinated notes contain a number of covenants that restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares, pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of its capital stock or make other restricted payments, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, create liens securing certain debt without securing the senior notes or senior subordinated notes, as applicable, sell certain assets, consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. 50 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet DebtAccounts Receivable Securitization Program Under the accounts receivable facility, eligible receivables are sold to third-party conduits through a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that is not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. We service the receivables and charge a monthly servicing fee at market rates. The third-party conduits are sponsored by certain lenders under our senior secured credit facilities. Additional subsidiaries may become parties to the facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions including the completion of satisfactory due diligence. Sales of receivables under the facility qualify as sales under applicable accounting pronouncements. Accordingly, receivables totaling $682 million, net of applicable allowances, and the corresponding borrowings, totaling $441 million, are excluded from our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. Our retained interest in these receivables is $243 million as of December 31, 2007. Expenses associated with the receivables facilities totaled $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, which related to the loss on sale of the receivables and the discount on retained interest, and is recorded in other expense in our consolidated statements of operations. The loss on sale of receivables was determined at the date of transfer based upon the fair value of the assets sold and the interests retained. We estimate fair value based on the present value of expected cash flows. The collection period and discount rate (prime rate of 7.25% at December 31, 2007) are the key assumptions used in this estimate. At December 31, 2007, a 20% adverse change in the assumed collection period or assumed discount rate would not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Covenant Compliance Our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes and our senior subordinated notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:  incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares,  pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments,  make certain investments,  sell certain assets,  create liens,  consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, and  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. In addition, pursuant to the Principal Investor Agreement by and among our four parent companies and the Sponsors, dated as of August 10, 2005 (the Principle Investor Agreement), we are required to obtain approval from certain Sponsors prior to the declaration or payment of any dividend by us or any of our subsidiaries (other than dividends payable to us or any of our wholly owned subsidiaries). Under the senior secured credit facilities and the receivables facility, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests. As of December 31, 2007, we are in compliance with the financial and nonfinancial covenants. Our continued ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios and tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior secured credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. 51 Table of Contents Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP measure used to determine our compliance with certain covenants contained in the indentures governing the senior notes and senior subordinated notes and in our senior secured credit facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indentures and our senior secured credit facilities. We believe that including supplementary information concerning Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance with our financing covenants. The breach of covenants in our senior secured credit facilities that are tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA could result in a default under that agreement and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. Any such acceleration would also result in a default under our indentures. Additionally, under our debt agreements, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is also tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent net income (loss) or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. While Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, these terms are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters that we may consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. In particular, the definition of Adjusted EBITDA in the indentures allows us to add back certain non-cash, extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income (loss). However, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. Further, our debt instruments require that it be calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters. As a result, the measure can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter. Further, it may not be comparable to the measure for any subsequent four-quarter period or any complete fiscal year. 52 Table of Contents The following is a reconciliation of net income (loss), which is a GAAP measure of our operating results, to Adjusted EBITDA as defined in our debt agreements, and the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio, net debt and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio under the indentures governing the senior notes and senior subordinated notes. The terms and related calculations are defined in the indentures.

(2) Non-cash charges include stock-based compensation resulting from the acceleration of vesting of stock options and restricted stock under Accounting Principles Board Opinion Number 25 (APB 25) due to the Transaction, stock-based compensation accounted for under SFAS 123R (see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and loss on the sale of assets. (3) Unusual or non-recurring items include merger costs associated with the Transaction, debt refinancing costs, payroll taxes and certain compensation, an unfavorable arbitration award related to a customer dispute, an insurance recovery and other expenses associated with both the Transaction and acquisitions made by the company. (4) Restructuring charges or reserves include the relocation of a leased AS facility in North Bergen, New Jersey to an expanded facility in Carlstadt, New Jersey. (5) Acquired EBITDA net of disposed EBITDA reflects the EBITDA impact of significant businesses that were acquired or disposed of during the period as if the acquisition or disposition occurred at the beginning of the period. (6) Other includes management fees paid to the Sponsors, gains or losses related to fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates impacting the foreign-denominated debt, franchise and similar taxes reported in operating expenses, offset by interest charges relating to the accounts receivable securitization program. (7) The loss on sale of receivables under the receivables facility is added back in calculating Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of the indentures governing the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes but is not added back in calculating Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of the senior secured credit facilities. 53 Table of Contents Our covenant requirements and actual ratios for the year ended December 31, 2007 are as follows: Covenant Requirements Actual Ratios Senior secured credit facilities (1) Minimum Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense ratio 1.60x 2.37 x Maximum total debt to Adjusted EBITDA 7.25x 5.11 x Senior notes and senior subordinated notes (2) Minimum Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges ratio required to incur additional debt pursuant to ratio provisions 2.00x 2.38 x (1) Our senior secured credit facilities require us to maintain an Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense ratio starting at a minimum of 1.60x for the four-quarter period ended December 31, 2007 and increasing over time to 1.65x by the end of 2008 and to 2.20x by the end of 2013. Consolidated interest expense is defined in the senior secured credit facilities as consolidated cash interest expense less cash interest income further adjusted for certain non-cash or nonrecurring interest expense and the elimination of interest expense and fees associated with our receivables facility. Beginning with the four-quarter period ending December 31, 2007, we are required to maintain a maximum consolidated total debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 7.25x and decreasing over time to 6.75x by the end of 2008 and to 4.0x by the end of 2013. Consolidated total debt is defined in the senior secured credit facilities as total debt less certain indebtedness and further adjusted for cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet in excess of $50 million. Failure to satisfy these ratio requirements would constitute a default under the senior secured credit facilities. If our lenders failed to waive any such default, our repayment obligations under the senior secured credit facilities could be accelerated, which would also constitute a default under our indentures. (2) Our ability to incur additional debt and make certain restricted payments under our indentures, subject to specified exceptions, is tied to an Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges ratio of at least 2.0x, except that we may incur certain debt and make certain restricted payments and certain permitted investments without regard to the ratio, such as our ability to incur up to an aggregate principal amount of $6.15 billion under credit facilities (inclusive of amounts outstanding under our senior credit facilities from time to time; as of December 31, 2007, we had $4.34 billion outstanding under our term loan facilities and available commitments of $941 million under our revolving credit facility), to acquire persons engaged in a similar business that become restricted subsidiaries and to make other investments equal to 6% of our consolidated assets. Fixed charges is defined in the indentures governing the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes as consolidated interest expense less interest income, adjusted for acquisitions, and further adjusted for non-cash interest and the elimination of interest expense and fees associated with our accounts receivable securitization program. Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on other topics related to accounting for income tax assets and liabilities, interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income taxes in interim periods as well as income tax disclosures. This Interpretation was effective as of January 1, 2007. FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS 157 is effective as of January 1, 2008. In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Positions No. 157-1 and No. 157-2 which partially defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets 54 Table of Contents and liabilities and remove certain leasing transactions from its scope. We are currently evaluating the requirements of this standard, but would not expect SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, (SFAS 158), Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). Under SFAS 158, companies must recognize a net liability or asset to report the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans (OPEB plans) on their balance sheets. SFAS 158 also requires certain additional annual disclosures related to pension and OPEB plans. SFAS 158 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, (SFAS 141R), which changes accounting principles for business acquisitions. SFAS No. 141R requires the recognition of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction based on the acquisition-date fair value. Certain provisions of this standard will, among other things, impact the determination of consideration paid or payable in a business combination and change accounting practices for transaction costs, acquired contingencies, acquisition-related restructuring costs, in-process research and development, indemnification assets, and tax benefits. SFAS No. 141R is effective for business combinations and adjustments to all acquisition-related deferred tax asset and liability balances occurring after December 31, 2008. We are currently evaluating the requirements of this standard; however, this standard could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). The objective of SFAS 160 is to improve the relevance, comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective January 1, 2009. We have not yet determined the impact of adopting SFAS 160 on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 is intended to help investors better understand how derivative instruments and hedging activities affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows through enhanced disclosure requirements. SFAS 161 is effective as of January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard, but would not expect SFAS 161 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk: We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We have invested our available cash in short-term, highly liquid financial instruments, with a substantial portion having initial maturities of three months or less. When necessary, we have borrowed to fund acquisitions. At December 31, 2007, we had total debt of $7.49 billion, including $4.37 billion of variable rate debt. We entered into two interest rate swap agreements which fixed the interest rates for $1.6 billion of our variable rate debt. Our two swap agreements each have a notional value of $800 million, effectively fix our interest rates at 4.85% and 5.00%, respectively, and expire in February 2009 and February 2011, respectively. In January 2008, we entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of $750 million, under which we are required to pay the counterparty a stream of fixed rate interest payments of 3.17%, and, in turn, receive variable interest payments based on LIBOR from the counterparty. In February 2008, we entered into a two year interest rate swap agreement for an additional notional amount of $750 million, under which we are required to pay the counterparty a stream of fixed rate interest payments of 2.71%, and, in turn, receive variable interest payments based on LIBOR from the counterparty. Our remaining variable rate debt of $1.27 billion is subject to changes in underlying interest rates and our interest payments will also change as a result of market changes. During the period when our interest rate swap agreements are effective, a 1% change in interest rates would 55 Table of Contents result in a change in interest of approximately $13 million per year. Upon the expiration of interest rate swap agreements in February in each of 2009, 2010 and 2011, a 1% change in interest rates would result in a change in interest of approximately $21 million, $28 million and $44 million per year, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2007, one of our U.K. subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the pound sterling, had $191 million of debt which is denominated in euros. A 10% change in the euro-pound sterling exchange rate would result in a charge or credit in the statement of operations of approximately $20 million. During 2007, approximately 29% of our revenue was from customers outside the United States with approximately 81% of this revenue coming from customers located in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. Only a portion of the revenue from customers outside the United States is denominated in other currencies, the majority being pounds sterling and euros. Revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in their respective local currencies. We continue to monitor our exposure to currency exchange rates. 56 Table of Contents BUSINESS Our Company We are one of the worlds leading software and IT services companies.

We believe that we are one of the most efficient operators of mission-critical IT solutions as a result of the economies of scale we derive from serving multiple customers on shared platforms. Our revenue is highly diversified by customer and product, with no single customer accounting for more than 4% of our total revenue during any of the past three fiscal years. We estimate that approximately 89% of our revenue for the past three fiscal years was recurring in nature. We were acquired on August 11, 2005 by a consortium of private equity investment funds associated with Bain Capital Partners, The Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs & Co., Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Providence Equity Partners, Silver Lake and Texas Pacific Group (the Transaction). Our Strengths Leading franchise in attractive industries. Built over many years, our business has leading positions and strong customer relationships in industries with attractive growth dynamics.  Leading industry positions. We believe that the majority of businesses within our FS segment are leaders in the sectors in which they participate within the highly fragmented global market for financial services IT software and services. We believe that HE and PS are both leading providers of software and services to higher education institutions and the public sector, respectively. AS is the pioneer and leading provider in the availability services industry.  Attractive industry dynamics. We believe that the sectors in which we participate have favorable growth dynamics. We believe that FS will benefit from several key industry dynamics: the shift from internal to external IT spending, the shift from infrastructure to application software spending, and the general increase in IT spending associated with rising compliance and regulatory requirements and real-time information needs. We anticipate that HE and PS will benefit from favorable growth dynamics in higher education and public safety IT spending. We believe that AS will continue to benefit from strong organic growth in the small and medium business sector. We believe that our strong relationships with our customers in the relatively fragmented software and processing sectors that we serve and our extensive experience and the significant total capital that we have invested in AS help us to maintain leading positions. We believe that these factors provide us with competitive advantages and enhance our growth potential. 57 Table of Contents Highly attractive business model. Our portfolio of businesses has substantial recurring revenue, a diversified customer base and significant operating cash flow generation.  Extensive portfolio of businesses with substantial recurring revenue. With a large portfolio of services and products in each of our four business segments, we have a diversified and stable business. We estimate that approximately 89% of our revenue for the past three fiscal years was recurring in nature. Because our FS customers generally pay us monthly fees that are based on metrics such as number of accounts or assets under management, we believe that our FS revenue is more insulated from trading and transaction volumes than the financial services industry at large. Our portfolio of businesses and the largely recurring nature of our revenue across all four of our segments have reduced volatility in our revenue and income from operations.  Diversified and stable customer base. Our base of more than 25,000 customers includes the worlds 50 largest financial services firms, a variety of other financial services firms, corporate and government treasury departments, energy companies, higher education institutions, school districts, local governments and not-for-profit organizations. Our AS business serves customers across virtually all industries. We believe that our specialized solutions and services help our customers improve operational efficiency, capture growth opportunities and respond to regulatory requirements, which results in long-term customer relationships. Our customer base is highly diversified with no single customer accounting for more than 4% of total revenue during any of the last three fiscal years.  Significant operating cash flow generation. The combination of moderate capital expenditures and minimal working capital requirements allows us to convert a significant proportion of our revenue to cash available for debt service. Experienced and committed management team with track record of success. Our management team fosters an entrepreneurial culture, has a long track record of operational excellence, has a proven ability to acquire and integrate complementary businesses, and is highly committed to our companys long-term success.  Long track record of operational excellence. We have a solid track record of performance consistent with internal financial targets. Our experienced senior executive officers have proven capabilities in both running a global business and managing numerous applications that are important to our customers. Our FS solutions account for and manage over $25 trillion in investment assets and process over 5 million transactions per day. In our HE business, more than 1,600 institutions rely on SunGard Higher Education to support their campuses. Our PS products are used by agencies that serve more than 100 million citizens in North America and 50 million citizens in the U.K. Our AS business has had a 100% success rate in supporting customer recoveries since our inception.  Successful, disciplined acquisition program. To complement our organic growth, we have a highly disciplined due diligence program to evaluate, execute and integrate acquisitions. We have completed more than 160 acquisitions over the past 20 years and overall have improved the operating performance of acquired businesses. Our ongoing acquisition program has contributed significantly to our long-term growth and success.  Experienced and committed management team. Our executive officers have on average more than 15 years of industry experience. Our senior managers have committed significant personal capital to our company in connection with the Transaction. 58 Table of Contents Business Strategy We are focused on expanding our position not only as a leading provider of integrated software and processing solutions, but also as the provider of choice for a wide range of availability services for IT-dependent companies. Our operating and financial strategy emphasizes fiscal discipline, profitable revenue growth and significant operating cash flow generation. In pursuit of these objectives, we have implemented the following strategies: Expand our industry-leading franchise. We are constantly enhancing our product and service offerings across our portfolio of businesses, further building and leveraging our customer relationships, and looking to acquire complementary businesses at attractive valuations.  Enhance our product and service offerings. We continually support, upgrade and enhance our systems to incorporate new technology and meet the needs of our customers for increased operational efficiency and resilience. Our strong base of recurring revenue allows us to reinvest in our products and services. We continue to introduce innovative products and services in all four of our business segments. We believe that our focus on product enhancement and innovation will help us to increase our penetration of existing and new customers.  Extend our strong customer relationships. We focus on developing trusted, well-managed, long-term relationships with our customers. We look to maximize cross-selling opportunities, increase our share of our customers total IT spending and maintain a high level of customer satisfaction. Our global account management program allows us to present a single face to our larger FS customers as well as better target potential cross-selling opportunities.  Acquire and integrate complementary businesses. We seek opportunistically to acquire, at attractive valuations, businesses that broaden our existing product and service offerings, expand our customer base and strengthen our leadership positions, especially within the fragmented FS, HE and PS markets. Before committing to an acquisition, we devote significant resources to due diligence and to developing a post-acquisition integration plan, including the identification and quantification of potential cost savings and synergies. Our ongoing acquisition program has contributed significantly to our long-term growth and success. Optimize our attractive business model. We continue to focus on maintaining our attractive business model and, in particular, increasing our recurring revenue base and implementing incremental operational improvements.  Increase our recurring revenue base. We strive to generate a high level of recurring revenue and stable cash flow from operations. We prefer to charge customers monthly subscription fees under multi-year contracts, and we continue to prefer such contracts because they offer high levels of revenue stability and visibility. Moreover, we believe that our high quality services and customized solutions help increase the level of integration and efficiency for our customers and reduce customer defections to other vendors or to in-house solutions.  Implement incremental operational improvements. We have identified opportunities to further increase revenue, reduce costs and improve cash flow from operations. These include the global account management program within FS, which stimulates cross-selling opportunities and account penetration for our largest customers; centralization of certain product management functions and expansion of certain software development capacity in lower-cost regions; the selective integration of certain FS, HE and PS business units and back-office operations; and the increased focus on generating revenue from ancillary services such as customer training and education as well as consulting. Enhance our performance-based culture. We have an experienced management team that is focused on enhancing our performance-based culture. We continue to evaluate and implement programs to improve our current management structure through competitive compensation plans and continue to design effective human resources initiatives to retain key individuals at acquired businesses. Our compensation program, consistent with past practices, is highly performance-based. 59 Table of Contents Business Segment Overview Our Segments Software & Processing Financial Systems Higher Education Public Sector Availability Services Revenue for the Year Ended December 31, 2007  $2.5 billion  $543 million  $410 million  $1.4 billion Product and Service Offerings  Specialized software and processing solutions that automate the business processes associated with trading securities, managing portfolios and accounting for investment assets, consulting services, and IT management services  Specialized software and enterprise resource planning solutions, professional services, consulting services and IT management services to address the administrative, academic and community needs of higher education institutions  Specialized software and enterprise resource planning and administrative solutions, public safety and justice solutions, K-12 student information solutions, consulting services and IT management services  Portfolio of always ready standby services, as well as advanced recovery and always on production services that help companies maintain uninterrupted access to their mission-critical IT systems Number of Customers  15,000  1,600  2,000  10,000 Primary Customers  Financial services companies  Corporate and government treasury departments  Energy companies  Higher education institutions  School districts  State and local governments  Central and federal government  Public safety and justice agencies  Not-for-profit organizations  Large, medium and small companies across virtually all industries Financial Systems FS provides mission-critical software and IT services to institutions in virtually every segment of the financial services industry. The primary purpose of these systems is to automate the many detailed processes associated with trading, managing investment portfolios and accounting for investment assets. These solutions address the processing requirements of a broad range of users within financial services, including asset managers, traders, custodians, compliance officers, treasurers, insurers, risk managers, hedge fund managers, plan administrators and clearing agents. In addition, we also provide professional services that focus on application implementation and integration of these solutions and on custom software development. Since our inception, we have consistently enhanced our FS solutions to add new features, process new types of financial instruments, meet new regulatory requirements, incorporate new technologies and meet evolving customer demands. We deliver many of our FS solutions as an application service provider, primarily from our data centers located in North America and Europe that customers access through the Internet or virtual private networks. We also deliver some of our FS solutions by licensing the software to customers for use on their own computers. 60 Table of Contents Our FS businesses are grouped internally into two divisions. The main distinction between the two divisions is that one division serves customers whose business is primarily in North America while the other division serves customers whose business is primarily international. The grouping of FS businesses into two divisions also takes into account the balance of management workload. Americas Division: The Americas division includes our Benefit Administration, Brokerage & Clearance, Insurance, Trading, Wealth Management and Workflow & Business Processing businesses as well as our US-based Consulting Services. It offers software solutions and strategic IT consulting to a broad range of users, including insurers and reinsurers, traders, custodians, plan administrators and compliance officers. These solutions help to automate and manage the trading and processing requirements of banks, broker/dealers, insurance companies, pension companies, fiduciary trusts and other financial services firms primarily in North America. International Division : The International division includes our Alternative Investments, Capital Markets & Investment Banking, Banks & Corporations and Institutional Asset Management businesses, as well as our European-based Consulting Services. It also includes our FS international distribution organization which conducts business with customers in China, Japan and the rest of Asia-Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The International division offers software solutions and strategic IT consulting to a broad range of users including asset managers, fund administrators, traders, compliance officers, market makers, chief financial officers and treasurers. These solutions help connect every stage of the investment lifecycle, from portfolio analysis to regulatory compliance to investor accounting and reporting. They also help mitigate risk and deliver straight-through processing. Our FS businesses in the Americas and International divisions are organized in the following customer-facing business areas: Alternative Investments : We offer solutions specifically designed for firms specializing in alternative investments. These solutions support multiple asset classes and their derivatives, including equities, currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, commodities, and convertibles. Solutions include strategy-specific applications for convertible and capital structure arbitrage, global repurchase agreements, stock finance, and listed options trading. Our enterprise-wide, straight-through processing solutions meet the trading, risk management, and investor and portfolio accounting requirements of single- and multi-strategy institutions. Banks & Corporations : For banks, we provide an integrated solution suite for asset/liability management, budgeting and planning, regulatory compliance, and profitability. In addition, our products manage all aspects of universal banking including back-office transaction processing, front-office multi-channel delivery, card management and payments. For corporations and governments, our solutions provide chief financial officers and treasurers with the ability to monitor cash flow in real time and with increased operational controls on treasury, receivables, and payments functions. An end-to-end collaborative financial management framework gives CFOs and treasurers tools to help drive maximum value from working capital and reduce risk. Benefit Administration : We serve organizations that administer defined-contribution and defined-benefit retirement plans, as well as organizations in every sector of the insurance industry. Our retirement plan systems support many plan types and fulfill functions ranging from recordkeeping and processing of contributions and payments to tax reporting and trade management. Brokerage & Clearance : We are a leading provider of solutions for the global processing of securities and derivatives. These solutions support trade processing, clearing, and accounting, helping brokerage and clearing firms streamline operations and control risk and cost. Our solutions provide centralized transactional databases, support cross-asset business functions, and offer consolidated views of accounts and risk management. These solutions help firms gain front-to-back operational efficiencies and realize advantages of scale, supporting business growth. Capital Markets & Investment Banking : Our solutions support cross-asset trading and straight-through processing of derivative instruments, helping investment banks to manage global trading books in multiple asset 61 Table of Contents classes. These solutions also support securities lending and borrowing, repurchase agreements, and related transactions. We also offer solutions for the enterprise-wide management of market, credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. In addition, we provide a framework for helping banks to manage operational risk and compliance requirements. Institutional Asset Management : We provide asset managers with comprehensive, integrated solutions to support their global investment operations. These solutions help connect every stage of the investment lifecycle, from portfolio analysis and electronic trading connectivity to regulatory compliance and investment accounting and reporting. We also provide systems for trading, pre- and post-trade compliance measurement, risk management, performance measurement and attribution, and data management. Insurance : We provide IT solutions for the insurance industry in each of the following major business lines: life/health/annuities/pensions, property and casualty, reinsurance, and asset management. Our software and services support functions from the front-office through the back-officefrom customer service and policy administration to actuarial calculations, financial and investment accounting, and reporting. Trading : We provide traders of U.S. equities, commodities and listed options with Web-based, electronic trading platforms for trade order management, direct market access and risk and compliance management. Our cross-asset solutions automate the transaction lifecycle, providing network connectivity and straight-through processing from pre- to post-trade. Our data analysis tools help improve the speed and ease of optimizing portfolios, assessing risk exposure, and identifying market opportunities. Our energy solutions help financial services institutions, industrial and energy companies to efficiently compete in global energy markets by streamlining and integrating the trading, risk management and operations of physical commodities and their associated financial instruments. These solutions provide front- to back-office support for capturing deals, delivering market data for valuation, clearing and reconciliation of transactions, invoicing and accounting for transactions, analysis and management of risk, and physical transmission or delivery of commodities.

We also provide a comprehensive, single-source solution for enterprise content management. Higher Education In HE, we provide software, strategic and systems integration consulting, and technology management services to colleges and universities. Our HE solutions help institutions worldwide strengthen institutional performance by improving constituent services, increasing accountability, and enhancing the education experience. Our Unified Digital Campus Solutions unite people, processes and technology in an environment that addresses the needs of higher education institutions and the people they serve with specific components tailored 62 Table of Contents to the unique needs of each institution. HE solutions include administration and enterprise resource planning, advancement, IT management and outsourcing, portal and communication tools, performance management, enrollment management, academic performance and strategic planning. Public Sector In PS, we provide software and processing solutions designed to meet the specialized needs of local, state, federal and central governments, public safety and justice agencies, public schools, utilities, non-profits, and other public sector institutions. Our systems and services help institutions improve the efficiency of their operations and utilize the Web and wireless technologies in serving their constituents. Our PS solutions support a range of specialized enterprise resource planning and administrative solutions for functions such as accounting, human resources, payroll, utility billing, land management, public safety and criminal justice, and grant and project management. Availability Services In AS, we help our customers improve the uptime and resilience of the information and computer systems they need to run their business by providing them with cost-effective resources to help keep their IT systems reliable and secure. Since we pioneered commercial disaster recovery in the 1970s, we believe that our dedicated focus on information availability solutions, together with our experience, technology expertise, resource management capabilities, vendor neutrality and diverse service offerings, have uniquely positioned us to meet customers varied needs in an environment where business functions are critically dependent on availability of IT. Over three decades, we have developed a comprehensive portfolio of information availability services that extend from always ready standby services, to blended advanced recovery services, to always on production and managed services. We also provide consulting services to help our customers design, implement and maintain their mission-critical systems. To serve our 10,000 AS customers, we utilize 4,000,000 square feet of operations space at over 60 locations in 10 countries and a global network of approximately 25,000 miles. Since our inception, we have had a 100% success rate supporting customer recoveries from unplanned interruptions, including during recent major disasters including the 2007 U.K. floods, the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes, 2004 Florida hurricanes, the 2003 Northeast U.S. blackout and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. SunGards principal information availability offering is a broad range of always ready standby services that were traditionally called disaster recovery or hot site services in which we provide 24/7 access to fully operational backup computer systems, allowing customers to recover their mainframe, distributed systems and server technology. These services help customers recover key information and systems in the event of an unplanned interruption, such as a major system failure, significant power or communication outage, security breach, labor stoppage, terrorist attack, fire, flood or natural disaster. By providing backup IT infrastructure, communications networks and alternate workspace for personnel, we help customers restore access to information and processing within a short period of time after an interruption, usually from several hours to two days. We deliver these services using processors, servers, storage devices, networks and other resources and infrastructure that are subscribed to by multiple customers, which results in economies of scale for us and cost-effectiveness for our customers, and through our mobile recovery units. These resources and infrastructure, when not needed by customers to recover from actual interruptions, are used around the clock by customers to test their plans for dealing with potential interruptions. As our customers business needs change and result in higher availability requirements, we provide them with advanced recovery services by combining basic hot site services and dedicated data storage resources, supported by a common robust infrastructure. These blended solutions, labeled advanced recovery, high availability, vaulting or replication solutions, provide the same advantages as standby services but also allow customers to continuously mirror their data to one of our sites using data storage and other resources dedicated to each customer. If there is an unplanned interruption at the customers site, the backup data is immediately available for restoring operations using our hot site service, helping customers to minimize data 63 Table of Contents loss and reduce recovery times. In addition, our alternate work space allows our customers employees to resume productivity quickly after an interruption and includes PCs, office resources, and voice and data connectivity. Our always on production or managed services help our customers keep their most critical applications running when disruptions would have immediate and severe financial or reputational repercussions. These services can be engineered with redundant or failover capabilities to virtually eliminate the possibility of any disruption and to limit any downtime to at most a few seconds or minutes. Examples of these production services include secure hosting of a customers database or server infrastructure, managing a customers full application infrastructure with dedicated hosting in a shared data center and managing a customers applications, which typically involves technical administration, monitoring and management of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and security services. Although always ready services remain our principal revenue generating services, advanced recovery and managed services increasingly account for a greater percentage of our new sales. Because advanced recovery services often result in greater use of both shared and dedicated resources, they typically generate appreciably higher revenue and income with a modest increase in capital expenditures and a modest decrease in operating margin rate than standby services. Managed services typically require more dedicated processors, servers, storage devices, networks and other resources, which are either obtained by the customer or provided by us for the customers exclusive use. These services generally produce a higher revenue opportunity but at a lower operating margin rate. With always on managed services, we create cost-effective economies of scale by leveraging our comprehensive resources and infrastructure, standardized and optimized processes and know-how as well as our resource management skills and purchasing power. 64 Table of Contents Acquisitions To complement our organic growth, we have a highly disciplined due diligence program to evaluate, execute and integrate acquisitions. Generally, we seek to acquire businesses that broaden our existing product lines and service offerings by adding complementary products and service offerings and by expanding our geographic reach. During 2007, we spent approximately $265 million in cash to acquire 11 businesses. The following table lists the businesses we acquired in 2007: Acquired Company/Business Date Acquired Description XRT SAs High-End Treasury Business 01/25/07 Treasury and cash management applications.

Financial Technology Integrators, LLC 12/21/07 Portfolio management systems for the bank, trust and investment management community. Product Development We continually support, upgrade and enhance our systems and develop new products to meet the needs of our customers for operational efficiency and resilience and to leverage advances in technology. Our Common Services Architecture (CSA) initiative allows our product development teams around the world to share, contribute to, and leverage, each others work. CSA is a technology frameworka vendor-agnostic service oriented architecture (SOA), based on mainstream open standards, that enables discrete components from SunGards product portfolio to be assembled to form composite applications. CSA allows our product development teams to share intellectual property, best practices and expertise for the benefit of our customers. Our expenditures for software development during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, including amounts that were capitalized, totaled approximately $265 million, $276 million and $297 million, respectively. These amounts do not include routine software support costs that are included in cost of sales, nor do they include costs incurred in performing certain customer-funded development projects in the ordinary course of business. 65 Table of Contents Marketing Most of our FS solutions are marketed throughout North America and Western Europe and many are marketed world wide, including Asia-Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, with the principal focus being on selling additional products and services to existing customers. Our AS, HE and PS solutions are marketed primarily in North America and Europe, with a focus on both new accounts and existing accounts. Our revenue from sales outside the United States during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007 totaled approximately $1.10 billion, $1.23 billion and $1.42 billion, respectively. Competition Since most of our computer services and software solutions are specialized and technical in nature, most of the market niches in which we compete have a relatively small number of significant competitors. Some of our existing competitors and some potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological and marketing resources than we have (see Risk Factors). Financial Systems. In our FS business, we compete with numerous other data processing and software vendors that may be broadly categorized into two groups. The first group is comprised of specialized financial systems companies that are much smaller than us. The second group is comprised of large computer services companies whose principal businesses are not in the financial systems area, some of which are also active acquirors. We also face competition from the internal processing and IT departments of our customers and prospects. The key competitive factors in marketing financial systems are the accuracy and timeliness of processed information provided to customers, features and adaptability of the software, level and quality of customer support, degree of responsiveness, level of software development expertise, total cost of ownership and return on investment. We believe that we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors and that our reputation and experience in this business are important competitive advantages. Higher Education and Public Sector. In our HE and PS businesses, we compete with a variety of other vendors depending upon customer characteristics such as size, type, location, computing environment and functional requirements. For example, there may be different competitors for different sizes or types of educational institutions or government agencies, or in different states or geographic regions. Competitors in this business range from larger providers of generic enterprise resource planning systems to smaller providers of specialized applications and technologies. We also compete with outsourcers and systems integrators, as well as the internal processing and information technology departments of our customers and prospective customers. The key competitive factors in marketing higher education and public sector systems are the accuracy and timeliness of processed information provided to customers, features and adaptability of the software, level and quality of customer support, degree of responsiveness, level of software development expertise and overall net cost. We believe that we compete effectively as to each of these factors and that our leadership and reputation in these businesses are important competitive advantages. Availability Services. In our AS business, our greatest source of competition for recovery and advanced recovery services is in-house dedicated solutions, which are solutions that our customers or prospective customers develop and maintain internally instead of purchasing those solutions from a vendor such as us. Historically, our single largest commercial competitor in the AS business for recovery and advanced recovery services has been IBM Corporation, which we believe is the only company other than ours that currently provides the full continuum of availability services. We also face competition from specialized vendors, including hardware manufacturers, data-replication and virtualization software companies, outsourcers, managed hosting companies, IT services companies and telecommunications companies. Competition among managed IT or data center service providers is fragmented with various competitor types, such as major telecommunication providers, carrier neutral managed services providers (MSPs), real estate investment trusts (REITs), IT outsourcers and regional colocation providers. We believe that we compete effectively with respect to the key competitive dimensions in information availability, namely economies of scale, quality of infrastructure, scope 66 Table of Contents and quality of services, including breadth of hardware platforms and network capacity, level and quality of customer support, level of technical expertise, vendor neutrality and price. We also believe that our experience and reputation as an innovator in information availability solutions, our proven track record, our financial stability and our ability to provide the entire portfolio of availability services as a single vendor solution are important competitive advantages. Employees On December 31, 2007, we had approximately 17,900 employees. We believe that our success depends partly on our continuing ability to retain and attract skilled technical, sales and management personnel. While skilled personnel are in high demand and competition exists for their talents, we believe that we have been able to retain and attract highly qualified personnel (see Risk Factors). We believe that our employee relations are excellent. Proprietary Protection We own registered marks for the SUNGARD name and own or have applied for trademark registrations for many of our services and software products. To protect our proprietary services and software, we rely upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret law, confidentiality restrictions in contracts with employees, customers and others, software security measures, and registered copyrights and patents. We also have established policies requiring our personnel and representatives to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary property. We have a few registrations of our copyrights and a number of patents and patent applications pending. We will continue to apply for software and business method patents on a case-by-case basis and will continue to monitor ongoing developments in the evolving software and business method patent field. See Risk Factors. Sustainable Development We have a strong commitment to sustainability. The customers, communities and environment we do business with and in are increasingly influenced by sustainability issues. Our employees identify strongly with global social, ethical and environmental issues such as climate change. Most of our businesses already have established practices for recycling, conservation and disposal of hazardous materials. We believe in accountability, doing business ethically and doing the right thing. During 2007, SunGard announced a commitment to introduce corporate guidelines on sustainable development and took the first steps toward making sustainability an integral part of how we work, including forming an employee Sustainability Work Group, becoming members of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the Green Grid, and signing the Bali Communique on Climate Change. We remain dedicated to establishing a corporate culture of sustainable development to help ensure that SunGard can continue to take pride in what we do and the way we do it. Properties and Facilities We lease space, primarily for availability services facilities, data centers, sales offices, customer support offices and administrative offices, in many locations worldwide. We also own some of our computer and office facilities. Our principal facilities include our leased availability services facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (578,200 square feet), Carlstadt, New Jersey (522,300 square feet), and Hounslow, England (195,000 square feet) and include our financial systems application service provider centers in Voorhees, New Jersey, Birmingham, Alabama, Burlington, Massachusetts and Ridgefield, New Jersey. We believe that our leased and owned facilities are adequate for our present operations. Legal Proceedings We are presently a party to certain lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that none of our current legal proceedings will be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. 67 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT Our executive officers and directors are listed below.

It provides qualitative information regarding the manner in which compensation is earned by our executive officers and places in context the data presented in the tables that follow. In addition, in this section, we address the compensation paid or awarded during fiscal year 2007 to our chief executive officer (principal executive officer), chief financial officer (principal financial officer) and three other executive officers who were the most highly compensated executive officers in fiscal year 2007. We refer to these five executive officers as our Named Executive Officers. Our executive compensation program is overseen and administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee operates under a written charter adopted by our Board and has responsibility for discharging the responsibilities of the Board of Directors relating to the compensation of the companys executive officers and related duties. Management presents cash and equity compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee for its consideration and approval. The Compensation Committee reviews these proposals and makes all final compensation decisions for corporate executive officers by exercising its discretion in accepting, modifying or rejecting any management recommendations. Objectives of Our Compensation Program Our executive compensation program is intended to meet three principal objectives:  to provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain superior executive talent;  to reward successful performance by the executive and the company by linking a significant portion of compensation to our financial and business results; and  to further align the interests of executive officers with those of our ultimate parent company stockholders by providing long-term equity compensation and meaningful equity ownership. To meet these objectives, our compensation program balances short-term and long-term performance goals and mixes fixed and at-risk compensation that is directly related to stockholder value and overall performance. Our compensation program for senior executives, including the Named Executive Officers, is designed to reward company performance. The compensation program is intended to reinforce the importance of performance and accountability at various operational levels, and therefore a significant portion of total compensation is in both cash and stock-based compensation incentives that reward performance as measured against established goals, i.e., pay for performance. Each element of our compensation program is reviewed individually and considered collectively with the other elements of our compensation program to ensure that it is consistent with the goals and objectives of both that particular element of compensation and our overall compensation program. For each Named Executive Officer, we look at each individuals contributions to our overall results, our operating and financial performance compared with the targeted goals, and our size and complexity compared with companies in our compensation peer group. Elements of Our Executive Compensation Program In 2007, the principal elements of compensation for Named Executive Officers were:  annual cash compensation consisting of base salary and performance-based incentive bonuses;  long-term equity incentive compensation;  benefits and perquisites; and  severance compensation and change of control protection. 72 Table of Contents Annual Cash Compensation Management develops recommendations for annual executive cash compensation plans by using compensation survey data for a broad set of organizations of comparable business, size and complexity, and then compares the survey results to publicly available compensation data for a group of companies we consider to be our peer group. We believe that the compensation practices of these companies provide us with appropriate benchmarks because they also provide technology products and services to a variety of customers and compete with us for executives and other employees. The survey data comes from two sources: Radford Executive Benchmark Survey, which focuses on technology companies (Radford), and Towers Perrin Compensation Data Bank, which focuses on a broader array of organizations including professional services (Towers Perrin), high-tech and manufacturing companies. For purposes of establishing compensation recommendations, we use a blend of the Radford and Towers Perrin survey data to reflect our size and industry. From the Radford survey data, we assessed compensation from 29 public and private companies with annual revenues in the range of $3 billion to $5 billion, and from the Towers Perrin survey data we assessed compensation of 80 companies with annual revenues in the range of $3 billion to $6 billion. The companies we consider within our peer group are financial services technology companies against which various businesses within the company compete for business and for talent. Peer group compensation data is limited to publicly available information and therefore generally does not provide precise comparisons by position as offered by the more comprehensive survey data from Radford and Towers Perrin. As a result, the peer group data provides limited guidance and does not dictate the setting of executive officers compensation. The following companies comprised our peer group in 2007: Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Electronic Data Systems Corporation Paychex, Inc. The BISYS Group, Inc. First Data Corporation SEI Investments Company Computer Sciences Corporation Fiserv, Inc. The Thomson Corporation DST Systems, Inc. Our annual cash compensation packages for executive officers include base salary and a performance-based executive incentive compensation (EIC) bonus. We generally target total cash compensation at approximately 85% of the blended survey data. Because we pay for performance, we weight the cash compensation more heavily toward the performance incentives and less toward the base salary. Base Salary . For base salary, we generally target the 60th percentile of the blended survey data to provide a fixed compensation based on competitive market practice that is not subject to performance risk while also considering other factors, such as individual and company performance. We review the base salaries for each Named Executive Officer annually as well as at the time of any promotion or significant change in job responsibilities. Base salaries are determined for each Named Executive Officer based on his or her position and responsibility by using survey data. In 2007, we provided salary increases for the Named Executive Officers of 1.5% except in cases where an executive was significantly below survey data or warranted a larger increase for promotion. In April 2007, Messrs. Ashton and Finders received promotions and received salary increases commensurate with their new responsibilities. Salary for each Named Executive Officer for calendar year 2007 is reported in the Summary Compensation Table below. Performance-Based Incentive Compensation. The annual EIC bonus for executive officers is designed to reward our executives for the achievement of annual financial goals related to the business for which they have responsibility. A minimum incentive may be earned at threshold EIC goals, which are set generally at levels that reflect an improvement over prior year results, and no payment is awarded if the threshold goal is not achieved. On-target EIC goals are set generally at levels that reflect budgeted performance. Consistent with our focus on pay for performance, additional amounts can be earned when actual performance exceeds on-target performance. 73 Table of Contents Additional mid-range goals between threshold and target with corresponding incentive amounts are also established. The company may revise or cancel an executives EIC at any time as a result of a significant change in circumstances or the occurrence of an unusual event that was not anticipated when the performance plan was approved. The financial measures used for the 2007 EIC bonuses for the Named Executive Officers were one or both of the following: (i) 2007 EBITA, which represents actual earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, noncash stock compensation expense, management fees paid to the private equity firms that acquired the company (Sponsors) and certain other unusual items (Internal EBITA) and (ii) 2007 budgeted revenue growth of the companys business segments. Internal EBITA and budgeted revenue growth were selected as the most appropriate measures upon which to base the annual incentive because they are important metrics that management and the Sponsors use to evaluate the performance of the company. The following table provides for the Named Executive Officers, for 2007, (i) the financial measure(s) used for the EIC bonuses, (ii) the on-target EIC goal, (iii) the amount earned if the on-target EIC goal is achieved, and (iv) the amount of 2007 EIC earned based on actual results: Name Financial Measures for 2007 EICs 2007 On-Target EIC Goal Amount Earned if 2007 On-Target EIC Goal Achieved EIC Earned based on Actual 2007 Results (1) Cristóbal Conde 2007 Internal EBITA of the consolidated company $ 1,124,800,000 $ 1,857,000 $ 1,883,400 Michael J. Ruane 2007 Internal EBITA of the consolidated company $ 1,124,800,000 $ 689,000 $ 698,851 James E.

Finders 2007 Internal EBITA of the companys Financial Systems segment $ 499,069,000 $ 513,505 $ 2,011,400 2007 budgeted revenue growth of the companys Financial Systems segment $ 2,245,541,000 Michael K. Muratore 2007 Internal EBITA of Financial Systems, Higher Education and Public Sector segments $ 734,100,000 $ 859,000 $ 1,034,036 (1) The amount of the 2007 EIC earned by the Named Executive Officers also appears in the Summary Compensation Table below under the Nonequity Incentive Plan Compensation column. Long-Term Equity Compensation We intend for our equity program to be the primary vehicle for offering long-term incentives and rewarding our executive officers, managers and key employees. Because of the direct relationship between the value of an option or restricted stock unit (RSU) award and the value of our stock, we believe that granting options and RSUs is the best method of motivating our executive officers to manage our company in a manner that is 74 Table of Contents consistent with the interests of our company and our stockholders. We also regard our equity program as a key retention tool. Retention is an important factor in our determination of the type of award to grant and the number of underlying Units to grant. In 2005 in connection with the Transaction, executive officers and other managers and key employees were granted a combination of time-based and performance-based options to purchase equity in the Equity-Issuing Parent Companies. The size of these initial option grants were commensurate with the executives position, performance and tenure with the company and were agreed to in connection with the Transaction. These grants were intended to cover the period between the grant date and December 31, 2010, absent promotions or other unusual circumstances. Accordingly, no Named Executive Officers received equity grants since 2005 other than Mr. Finders, who received a 2007 option grant due to his promotion to Division Chief Executive Officer, Financial Systems. Additional information on Mr. Finders 2007 grant and all outstanding grants to the Named Executive Officers are shown in the 2007 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table and Outstanding Equity Awards at 2007 Fiscal Year-End Table below, respectively. Performance-based options granted to the Named Executive Officers vest upon the attainment of certain annual or cumulative earnings goals based on Internal EBITA targets for the company during a specified performance period, generally five or six years. Based upon actual year-end 2007 results, 4.38% of each 2005 performance-based option award vested out of a maximum of 16.67% available to vest each of six years in the performance period, and 5.26% of each 2007 performance-based option award vested out of a maximum of 20% available to vest each of five years in the performance period. The annual vesting goals for the performance-based options were agreed to by the Sponsors and senior management in August 2005 in connection with the Transaction and require sustained and superior company-wide performance in each of the years in the performance period but allow for additional vesting for over performance. Benefits and Perquisites We offer a variety of health and welfare programs to all eligible employees, including the Named Executive Officers. The Named Executive Officers generally are eligible for the same benefit programs on the same basis as the rest of the companys employees in the particular country in which the Named Executive Officer resides, including medical and dental care coverage, life insurance coverage, short-and long-term disability and a 401(k) or defined contribution pension plan. The company limits the use of perquisites as a method of compensation and provides executive officers with only those perquisites that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program to better enable the company to attract and retain superior employees for key positions. The perquisites provided to the Named Executive Officers include leased automobiles and related tax gross-ups and are quantified in the Summary Compensation Table below. Employment Agreements, Severance Compensation & Change of Control Protection In connection with the Transaction, the company entered into definitive employment agreements with certain senior managers, including the Named Executive Officers. The executives with such agreements are eligible for payments if employment terminates or if there is a change of control, as described under Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control below. The agreements were designed to retain executives and provide continuity of management in the event of an actual or threatened change of control. The agreements include the following terms:  A term through December 31, 2010, with one-year automatic renewals unless terminated on one years advance notice.  The same base salary as that payable by the company prior to the Transaction, subject to annual adjustments, if any, made by the board of directors or the compensation committee of the board, in 75 Table of Contents consultation with the chief executive officer. See Base Salary above for a description of the determination of base salary for the companys senior management.  The opportunity to earn an annual cash bonus provided that the aggregate bonus opportunity for the senior management as a group will be consistent with that provided by the company to executives as a group prior to the Transaction, although the board of directors may re-align the performance metrics and other terms in consultation with the chief executive officer. See Performance-Based Incentive Compensation above for a description of the determination of cash bonuses for the companys senior management.  Employee benefits consistent with those provided by the company to executives prior to the Transaction, including the right to participate in all employee benefit plans and programs.  Participation in the equity plan of SunGard Capital Corp. and SunGard Capital Corp. II.  The right to receive certain severance payments and benefits, including upon a termination without cause, a resignation for good reason or a change of control, consistent with the severance payments and benefits provided for under the change of control agreement with the company in effect prior to the Transaction. See Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control below.  Certain restrictive covenants (noncompetition, confidentiality and nonsolicitation) that continue for applicable post-termination periods.  The right to receive a tax gross-up payment should any payment provided under the agreement be subject to the excise tax under section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, under the terms of the option awards made to executives, acceleration of vesting of options occurs if a change of control takes place or due to certain other termination events. These arrangements and potential post-employment termination compensation payments are described in more detail in the section entitled Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control below. Accounting and Tax Implications The accounting and tax treatment of particular forms of compensation do not materially affect the Compensation Committees compensation decisions. However, we evaluate the effect of such accounting and tax treatment on an ongoing basis and will make appropriate modifications to compensation policies where appropriate. Stock Ownership The company does not have a formal policy requiring stock ownership by management. Our senior managers, including the Named Executive Officers, however, have committed significant personal capital to our company in connection with the Transaction. See Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners below. 76 Table of Contents Summary Compensation Table The following table contains certain information about compensation earned in 2007 and 2006 by the Named Executive Officers.

The amounts thus include amounts from awards granted on August 12, 2005 at an exercise price of $18.00 per Unit and for Mr. Finders amounts from awards granted on September 21, 2007 at an exercise price of $20.72 per Unit. No option awards were granted in 2006 to any of the Named Executive Officers. Assumptions used in the calculation of this amount are included in Note 6 of the Notes to the companys Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 included in the financial pages of this prospectus. Because these amounts represent expense for financial reporting purposes, they are not representative of the actual value that the Named Executive Officer would receive upon exercise of these options.

All amounts have been converted into U.S. dollars at the average 2007 currency exchange rate of 0.83424. Compensation information for fiscal year 2006 is not provided for Mr. Finders because he was not a Named Executive Officer in that year. Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2007 To provide long-term equity incentives following the Transaction, the SunGard 2005 Management Incentive Plan (Plan) was established. The Plan authorizes the issuance of equity subject to awards made under the Plan for up to 60 million shares of Class A common stock and 7 million shares of Class L common stock of SunGard Capital Corp. and 2.5 million shares of preferred stock of SunGard Capital Corp. II. Under the Plan, awards of time-based and performance-based options have been granted to purchase Units in the Equity-Issuing Parent Companies. Each Unit consists of 1.3 shares of Class A common stock and 0.1444 shares of Class L common stock of SunGard Capital Corp. and 0.05 shares of preferred stock of SunGard Capital Corp. II. The shares comprising a Unit are in the same proportion as the shares issued to all stockholders of the Equity-Issuing Parent Companies. The options are exercisable only for whole Units and cannot be separately exercised for the individual classes of stock. Beginning in 2007, hybrid equity awards generally were granted under the Plan, which awards are composed of restricted stock units (RSUs) for Units in the Equity-Issuing Parent Companies and options to purchase Class A common stock in SunGard Capital Corp. All awards under the Plan are granted at fair market value on the date of grant. Time-based options vest over five years as follows: 25% one year after date of grant, and 1 / 48 th of the remaining balance each month thereafter for 48 months. Time-based RSUs vest over five years as follows: 10% one year after date of grant, and 1 / 48 th of the remaining balance each month thereafter for 48 months. Performance-based options and RSUs vest upon the attainment of certain annual or cumulative earnings goals based on Internal EBITA targets for the company during a specified performance period, generally five or six years.

Pension Benefits None of the Named Executive Officers receive benefits under any defined benefit or actuarial pension plan. Employment and Change of Control Agreements As discussed above, the company entered into a definitive employment agreement with each of the Named Executive Officers. The terms of these agreements are described above under Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control Pursuant to the terms of the executive employment agreements and option agreements, set forth below is a description of the potential payments the Named Executive Officers would receive if their employment was terminated. The terms cause, good reason, change of control and sale of business are defined in the executive employment agreements. Forms of these agreements have been filed as exhibits to the companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005. Termination without Cause or for Good Reason; Certain Change in Control Transactions . If a Named Executive Officers employment is terminated by the company without cause, or a Named Executive Officer terminates his employment in certain circumstances which constitute good reason, including certain change of control transactions, then:  the company will pay the Named Executive Officer the following:  a lump sum cash severance amount equal to the applicable multiplier multiplied by the sum of 2007 base salary and target incentive bonus;  a lump sum cash payment of all accrued compensation (as defined in the agreement) as of December 31, 2007; 80 Table of Contents  either (i) continued coverage under health and welfare benefits for the number of years equal to the applicable multiplier after termination of his employment or (ii) the company may elect to pay cash in lieu of such continued coverage in an amount equal to the after-tax cost of obtaining comparable coverage;  an amount equal to any excise tax charged to the Named Executive Officer as a result of the receipt of any change of control payments;  performance-based options vest on a pro rata basis through the termination date, time-based options immediately stop vesting and all unvested time-based options are forfeited;  if a change of control occurs and employment is not offered, then all unvested performance-based options vest on a return-on-equity basis and all unvested time-based options become fully vested;  if a sale of the business occurs and the employment agreement is not assumed, then performance-based options vest on a pro rata basis through the termination date, all unvested time-based options become fully vested and all unvested performance-based options are forfeited. Resignation without Good Reason; Certain Change in Control or Sale of Business Transactions . If a Named Executive Officer terminates his employment voluntarily without good reason, including certain change of control and sale of business transactions, then:  the company will pay the Named Executive Officer only a lump sum cash payment of all accrued compensation with the exception of his 2007 pro rated target incentive bonus;  all performance-based options stop vesting as of the beginning of the year of termination, all time-based options immediately stop vesting, and all unvested time-based and performance-based options are forfeited; and  with the exception of Mr. Conde, if a change of control occurs and employment is offered but the Named Executive Officer resigns, then all unvested performance-based options vest on a return-on-equity basis and all unvested time-based options become fully vested. Under the terms of Mr. Condes employment agreement, if a change of control occurs and Mr. Conde is offered employment but he resigns, his resignation is considered for good reason. Termination for Cause . If the company terminates a Named Executive Officers employment for cause, then:  the company will pay the Named Executive Officer only a lump sum cash payment of all accrued compensation with the exception of his 2007 pro rated target incentive bonus;  all vested and unvested time and performance options are forfeited. Disability or Death. If a Named Executive Officers employment is terminated due to his disability or death, then:  the company will pay the Named Executive Officer (or his beneficiary in the event of death) a lump sum cash payment of all accrued compensation;  the Named Executive Officer (or his beneficiary in the event of death) shall receive payments under an insurance policy offered through the company; and  performance-based options vest on a pro rata basis through the termination date; all time-based options immediately stop vesting and all unvested time-based options are forfeited. In order to receive any of the above described severance benefits, the Named Executive Officer is required to execute a release of all claims against the company. In order to exercise stock options, the Named Executive Officer must execute a certificate of compliance with the restrictive covenants contained in his employment agreement and all other agreements. 81 Table of Contents The tables below reflect the amount of compensation payable to each of the Named Executive Officers in the event of termination of such executives employment. The amounts shown assume that such termination was effective as of December 31, 2007, and thus includes amounts earned through such time and are estimates of the amounts which would be paid out to the Named Executive Officers upon their termination. The actual amounts to be paid, if any, can only be determined at the time of such executives separation from the company.

The RSU vests over five years as follows: 10% one year after date of grant, and 1/48th of the remaining balance each month thereafter for 48 months. Once vested, the RSUs become payable in shares upon the first to occur of a change of 86 Table of Contents control, removal or resignation as a director, or the date that is five years after the date of grant. The option expires ten years from the date of grant and vests over five years as follows: 25% one year after date of grant and 1/48th of the remaining balance each month thereafter for 48 months. The following table contains for Mr. Mann compensation received during the year ended December 31, 2007 for serving as a director of the company and its holding companies.

If the conflict involves a director or executive officer or is considered material, the situation will be reviewed by the Compliance Committee.

In other cases, conflicts are reviewed and resolved by the Compliance Committee. Additionally, in connection with the Transaction, the companys four parent companies and the Sponsors entered into a Principal Investor Agreement which requires affiliated party transactions involving the Sponsors to be approved by the majority of Sponsors not involved in the affiliated party transaction. On August 11, 2005, upon completion of the Transaction, the company and its four parent companies entered into a management agreement with affiliates of each of the Sponsors pursuant to which such entities or their affiliates will provide management consultant services, including financial, managerial and operational advice and implementation of strategies for improving the operating, marketing and financial performance of the company and its subsidiaries. Under the management agreement, affiliates of the Sponsors receive quarterly management fees equal to 1% of the companys quarterly EBITDA, as defined in the indentures governing the notes (but assuming the management fee had not been paid for purposes of such calculation), and reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them or their affiliates in connection with the provision of management consulting services pursuant to the agreement. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, the company recorded an additional $14 million and $17 million relating to management fees, respectively. In the event that the management agreement is terminated, the Sponsors will receive a lump sum payment equal to the present value of the annual management fees that would have been payable for the remainder of the term of the management agreement. The initial term of the management agreement is ten years, and it extends annually for one year unless the Sponsors or the company and its four parent companies provide notice to the other. Finally, the management agreement provides that affiliates of the Sponsors will be entitled to receive a fee equal to 1% of the gross transaction value in connection with certain subsequent financing, acquisition, disposition and change of control transactions in excess of a threshold amount. In connection with the Transaction, SunGard Capital Corp., an indirect parent company of SunGard Data Systems Inc. received a $16 million promissory note from Cristóbal Conde, our chief executive officer in payment for 1.6 million shares of Class A common stock and 0.2 million shares of Class L common stock. Also in connection with the Transaction, SunGard Capital Corp. II, an indirect parent company of SunGard Data Systems Inc., received a $6 million promissory note (together with the SunGard Capital Corp. note, the Notes) from Mr. Conde in payment for 61,000 shares of preferred stock. In October 2007, these Notes were fully repaid and cancelled. The Notes bore interest at a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.5% divided by 0.84725% per annum and were payable on the last day of each calendar quarter in arrears. SunGard Data Systems Inc. was not a party to these arrangements, which were entered into prior to the consummation of the Transaction. In addition to serving as a director, Mr. Mann is currently an employee of the company and accordingly in 2007 received salary and benefits. See note 2 to the table under ManagementDirector Compensation. 93 Table of Contents DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE The company is a privately held corporation. Our directors (other than Messrs. Conde and Mann) are not independent because of their affiliations with funds which hold more than 5% equity interests in the Equity-Issuing Parent Companies. Messrs. Conde and Mann are not independent directors because they are currently employed by the company. 94 Table of Contents DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS Senior Secured Credit Facilities Overview In connection with the Transaction, we entered into a senior secured credit agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as joint lead arranger, joint bookrunner and co-syndication agent, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as joint bookrunner and co-syndication agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and collateral agent. The senior secured credit facilities entered into in connection with the Transaction provided senior secured financing of $5,000 million, consisting of:  $4,000 million-equivalent in term loan facilities, comprised of a $3,685 million facility and $315 million-equivalent facilities, $165 million of which is denominated in euros and $150 million of which is denominated in pounds sterling; and  a $1,000 million revolving credit facility. In February 2007, we entered into an amendment to, among other things, increase the amount of term loan facilities by $400 million. After giving effect to the amendment, the aggregate amount of the U.S. dollar denominated portion of the term loan facilities was approximately $4,030 million. SunGard is the primary borrower under the senior secured credit facilities, except that a newly formed U.K. subsidiary, organized under the laws of the United Kingdom, is the borrower under the sterling and euro term loan facilities. We also have the ability to designate one or more of our other U.K. subsidiaries as borrowers under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for borrowings on same-day notice referred to as the swingline loans and is available in U.S. dollars, euros and pound sterling. Interest Rate and Fees Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and (2) the federal funds rate plus 1 / 2 of 1% or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for deposits in the currency of such borrowing for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs. The initial applicable margin for borrowings was, under the revolving credit facility, 1.50% with respect to base rate borrowings and 2.50% with respect to LIBOR borrowings and, under the term loan facilities, 1.50% with respect to base rate borrowings and 2.50% with respect to LIBOR borrowings. In February 2007, we entered into an amendment to, among other things, reduce the interest rate margin on all outstanding term loans under the senior secured credit agreement to 1.00% with respect to base rate borrowings and 2.00% with respect to LIBOR borrowings. The applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility and under the term loan facilities may be reduced subject to our attaining certain leverage ratios. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the senior secured credit facilities, we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The initial commitment fee rate is 0.50% per annum. The commitment fee rate may be reduced subject to our attaining certain leverage ratios. We must also pay customary letter of credit fees. 95 Table of Contents Prepayments The senior secured credit agreement requires us to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with:  50% (which percentage is reduced to 0% if our total leverage ratio is less than 5.00 to 1.00) of our annual excess cash flow;  100% of the net cash proceeds of all nonordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property by SunGard Holdco LLC and its subsidiaries (including insurance and condemnation proceeds), other than the sale of receivables in connection with the receivables facility, if we do not commit to reinvest those proceeds in assets to be used in our business or to make certain other permitted investments within 15 months as long as such reinvestment is completed within 180 days;  100% of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt, other than proceeds from the receivables facility and other debt permitted under the senior secured credit agreement; and  100% of the net cash proceeds of financings under the receivables facility in excess of $750 million, including increases in the amount of the receivables facility. The foregoing mandatory prepayments are applied pro rata to the term loan facilities and to installments of the term loan facilities in direct order of maturity. We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the senior secured credit facilities at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to LIBOR loans. Amortization We are required to repay installments on the loans under the term loan facilities in quarterly principal amounts of 0.25% of their funded total principal amount through March 2013, with the remaining amount payable in May 2013, provided, however, that such date will automatically become February 2014 if all the senior notes are extended, renewed or refinanced on or prior to May 15, 2013. Principal amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due and payable in full at maturity in August 2011. Guarantee and Security All obligations under the senior secured credit agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by SunGard Holdco LLC and, subject to certain exceptions, each of our existing and future domestic wholly owned subsidiaries, referred to, collectively, as U.S. Guarantors. In addition, if our U.K. subsidiary borrowers borrow under the revolving credit facility, those borrowings are required to be unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our wholly owned U.K. subsidiaries. All obligations under the senior secured credit facilities, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all the following assets of SunGard Holdco LLC, us and each U.S. Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions:  a pledge of 100% of the capital stock of SunGard Data Systems Inc., 100% of the capital stock of each U.S. Guarantor and 65% of the capital stock of each of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that are directly owned by us or one of the U.S. Guarantors; and  a security interest in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible assets of SunGard Holdco LLC, SunGard Data Systems Inc. and each U.S. Guarantor. 96 Table of Contents In addition, any obligations of U.K. borrowers under the revolving credit facility, and any U.K. guarantees of such obligations, are required to be secured by the following (subject to certain exceptions and only to the extent that the granting of such security interests does not give rise to the requirement that the senior secured notes described under Senior Secured Notes below be equally and ratably secured by such assets):  a pledge of the capital stock of each U.K. borrower and each U.K. guarantor; and  a lien on substantially all tangible and intangible assets of each U.K. borrower and each U.K. guarantor. Certain Covenants and Events of Default The senior secured credit agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to:  incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;  create liens on assets;  enter into sale and leaseback transactions;  engage in mergers or consolidations;  sell assets;  pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock;  make investments, loans or advances;  make capital expenditures;  repay subordinated indebtedness (including the senior subordinated notes);  make certain acquisitions;  engage in certain transactions with affiliates;  amend material agreements governing our subordinated indebtedness (including the senior subordinated notes);  change our lines of business; and  change the status of SunGard Holdco LLC as a passive holding company. In addition, the senior secured credit agreement requires us to maintain the following financial covenants:  a maximum total leverage ratio; and  a minimum interest coverage ratio. The senior secured credit agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. Receivables Facility Overview In connection with the Merger, certain of our domestic subsidiaries entered into a receivables facility that provided, in the aggregate, up to $375 million in funding for a period of six years following the closing of the Merger. In December 2005, the agreements governing the principal receivables facility were amended to, among other things, increase the aggregate availability from $375 million to a maximum amount of $450 million and change certain other terms thereof, and the company terminated its transitional receivables facility (which had provided an amount of funding up to a maximum of $375 million less that amount of funding under the principal 97 Table of Contents receivables facility). The aggregate availability under the receivables facility of $450 million is subject to the amount of eligible receivables and satisfaction of other customary conditions. As part of the amendments, certain additional subsidiaries of the company became participants in the facility. Subsidiaries that participate in the receivables facility transfer their receivables to a newly formed bankruptcy remote finance subsidiary of the company. The funding under the long-term receivables facility is provided by commercial paper conduits sponsored by lenders under our senior secured credit facilities. The investment of the commercial paper conduits in the long-term receivables facility is guaranteed by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (the insurer). Availability of funding under the receivables facility depends primarily upon the outstanding trade accounts receivable balance of our subsidiaries that participate, or become eligible to participate, in the facility. Aggregate availability is determined by using a formula that reduces the gross receivables balance by factors that take into account historical default and dilution rates, excessive concentrations and average days outstanding and the costs of the facility. A commercial paper conduit may discontinue its funding under the receivables facility at any time without cause. If it does, the bank sponsor of the applicable commercial paper conduit is obligated to fund the receivables facility. It is anticipated that additional subsidiaries of the company may become parties to the receivables facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions, including the completion of satisfactory due diligence with respect to the receivables of such subsidiaries by the insurer and the bank sponsors. Upon becoming parties, receivables originated by these subsidiaries will be included in the receivables balance eligible for funding under the receivables facility and will be included in the calculation of available funding thereunder. Interest Rates and Fees Under the receivables facility, the finance subsidiary is required to pay interest on the amount of each advance at the quoted cost of funds for each commercial paper conduits issuance of commercial paper. When not funded by the commercial paper conduits (but directly through the conduit sponsors), the receivables facility provides funding at an applicable margin equal to either (1) the LIBO rate plus the applicable rate for Eurodollar Loans in effect under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, or (2) the base rate plus the applicable rate for Base Rate Loans in effect under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement. In addition, the finance subsidiary is currently required to pay fees on the unused portion of the commitments under the receivables facility of 0.65% per annum, and fees on the used portion of the receivables facility of 1.40% per annum. These fees may be subject to adjustment based on changes in the ratings of the receivables facility. In addition, the company, acting as receivables collection agent, services, administers and collects receivables transferred pursuant to the receivables facility. Under the receivables facility, the company receives a monthly servicing fee of approximately 0.50% of the daily average outstanding balance of the receivables under such facility, payable monthly in arrears by our newly formed finance subsidiary. Termination Events The receivables facility may be terminated for material breaches of representations and warranties, bankruptcies of any seller, the collection agent or the transferor, a default by any seller or the transferor in the performance of any payment required to be made under the transaction documents, a merger or similar transaction involving the transferor, a merger or transaction involving any seller whereby the seller is not the surviving entity or cross acceleration under our other facilities, among other reasons. Accounting Matters The receivables facility has been structured in a manner that qualifies it for off-balance sheet treatment. 98 Table of Contents Senior Secured Notes In January 2004, SunGard issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% senior notes due 2009 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2014 under a single indenture. Upon consummation of the Transaction, the senior secured notes became secured on an equal and ratable basis with loans under the senior secured credit facilities to the extent required by the indenture governing the senior secured notes and are guaranteed by all our subsidiaries that guarantee the notes. The terms of the indenture governing the senior secured notes provide that, in addition to customary events of default, a payment default or other default resulting in acceleration of payment obligations under any other indebtedness of SunGard or its subsidiaries aggregating more than $75 million, including the notes, constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the senior secured notes. 99 Table of Contents DESCRIPTION OF SENIOR NOTES General Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading Certain Definitions. In this description, (i) the terms  we ,  our  and  us  each refer to (a) prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, Solar Capital Corp. and not any of its Affiliates and (b) from and after the consummation of the Acquisition, SunGard Data Systems Inc. ( SunGard ) and its consolidated Subsidiaries, assuming completion of the Transaction; and (ii) the term  Issuer  refers only to (a) prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, Solar Capital Corp. and not any of its Affiliates and (b) from and after the consummation of the Acquisition, SunGard Data Systems Inc. and not any of its Subsidiaries. The Issuer issued $1,600 million aggregate principal amount of 9 1 / 8 % senior notes due 2013 (the  Senior Notes ) under an indenture dated August 11, 2005 (the  Indenture ) among the Issuer, the Guarantors and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the  Trustee ). The Senior Notes were issued in a private transaction that was not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Except as set forth herein, the terms of the Senior Notes are substantially identical and include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act. The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of those agreements, including the definitions therein of certain terms used below. We urge you to read the Indenture because it, not this description, defines your rights as Holders of the Senior Notes. You may request copies of the Indenture at our address set forth under the heading Prospectus Summary. Brief Description of Senior Notes The Senior Notes are:  unsecured senior obligations of the Issuer;  pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness (including the Senior Credit Facilities and Senior Secured Notes) of the Issuer;  effectively subordinated to all secured Indebtedness of the Issuer (including the Senior Credit Facilities and Senior Secured Notes);  senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined with respect to the Senior Notes) (including the Senior Subordinated Notes) of the Issuer;  initially guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Senior Credit Facilities; and  subject to registration with the SEC pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement. Guarantees The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, jointly and severally irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee, on an unsecured senior basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Senior Notes, whether for payment of principal of or interest on or Additional Interest in respect of the Senior Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture. The Restricted Subsidiaries (other than as detailed below) guarantee the Senior Notes. Each of the Guarantees of the Senior Notes is a general unsecured obligation of each Guarantor and is pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of each such entity, is effectively subordinated to all 100 Table of Contents secured Indebtedness of each such entity and is senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness (including the Senior Subordinated Notes) of each such entity. The Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to Indebtedness of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not Guarantee the Senior Notes. Not all of the Issuers Subsidiaries guarantee the Senior Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer. None of our Foreign Subsidiaries, broker-dealer subsidiaries, non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (subject to certain limited exceptions) or any Receivables Subsidiary guarantee the Senior Notes. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries generated 33% and 18% of SunGards total revenue and EBITDA, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2007, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries held 23% of SunGards consolidated assets. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantees are limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantees from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. Any entity that makes a payment under its Guarantee is entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantors pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. If a Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantors liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesFederal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and the related guarantees of the notes, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes. A Guarantee by a Guarantor provides by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) (a) any sale, exchange or transfer (by merger or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor (including any sale, exchange or transfer), after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or all or substantially all the assets of such Guarantor which sale, exchange or transfer is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (b) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Guarantor of the Senior Credit Facilities or the guarantee which resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee; (c) the proper designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; or (d) the Issuer exercising its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance or the Issuers obligations under the Indenture being discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; and (2) such Guarantor delivering to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with. Ranking Senior Secured Indebtedness Versus the Senior Notes The payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Notes and the payment of any Guarantee rank pari passu in right of payment to all Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, including the obligations of the Issuer and such Guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes. 101 Table of Contents The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of the Issuers and the Guarantors existing and future secured Indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness. As of December 31, 2007, SunGard had $4,874 million of secured Indebtedness, consisting entirely of secured Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes (which have a face amount of $500 million, but are recorded at $470 million and have been secured as of the Issue Date). As of December 31, 2007, $441 million of funding also is outstanding under our Receivables Facility. Although the Indenture contains limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Issuer and the Guarantors may incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial and, in any case, such Indebtedness may be Senior Indebtedness. See Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock. Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Notes The Issuer maintains one or more paying agents for the Senior Notes in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York. The initial paying agent for the Senior Notes is the Trustee. The Issuer also maintains a registrar with offices in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York. The initial registrar is the Trustee. The registrar maintains a register reflecting ownership of the Senior Notes outstanding from time to time and makes payments on and facilitates transfer of Senior Notes on behalf of the Issuer. The Issuer may change the paying agents or the registrars without prior notice to the Holders. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent or registrar. Transfer and Exchange A Holder may transfer or exchange Senior Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of Senior Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Senior Note selected for redemption. Also, the Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Senior Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of Senior Notes to be redeemed. Principal, Maturity and Interest The Issuer issued $1,600 million of Senior Notes in this offering. The Senior Notes mature on August 15, 2013. Subject to compliance with the covenant described below under the caption Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock, the Issuer may issue additional Senior Notes from time to time after this offering under the Indenture ( Additional Senior Notes ). Holders of each series of Senior Notes do not have separate rights to, among other things, give notice of Defaults or to direct the Trustee to exercise remedies during Event of Default or otherwise. The Senior Notes offered by the Issuer and any Additional Senior Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture are treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to Senior Notes for all purposes of the Indenture and this Description of Senior Notes include any Additional Senior Notes that are actually issued. Interest on the Senior Notes accrues at the rate of 9 1 / 8 % per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15, commencing on February 15, 2006, to the Holders of Senior Notes of record on the immediately preceding February 1 and August 1. Interest on the Senior Notes accrues from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date. Interest on the Senior Notes is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. 102 Table of Contents Additional Interest Additional Interest may accrue on the Senior Notes in certain circumstances pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. All references in the Indenture, in any context, to any interest or other amount payable on or with respect to the Senior Notes shall be deemed to include any Additional Interest pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Notes are payable at the office or agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose within the City and State of New York or, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders of the Senior Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Senior Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee are made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holder or Holders thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Issuer, the Issuers office or agency in New York is the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose. Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases The Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Senior Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Senior Notes as described under the caption Repurchase at the Option of Holders. We may at any time and from time to time purchase Senior Notes in the open market or otherwise. Optional Redemption Except as set forth below, the Issuer is not entitled to redeem Senior Notes at its option prior to August 15, 2009. At any time prior to August 15, 2009, the Issuer may redeem all or a part of the Senior Notes, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice mailed by first-class mail to the registered address of each Holder of Senior Notes, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date of redemption (the  Redemption Date ), subject to the rights of Holders of Senior Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. On and after August 15, 2009, the Issuer may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under the heading Repurchase at the Option of HoldersSelection and Notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Interest, if any, to the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of Senior Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on August 15 of each of the years indicated below: Year Percentage 2009 104.563 % 2010 102.281 % 2011 and thereafter 100.000 % In addition, until August 15, 2008, the Issuer may, at its option, on one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 109.125% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Interest, if any, to the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of Senior Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided that at least 50% of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes originally issued under the 103 Table of Contents Indenture and any Additional Senior Notes issued under the Indenture after the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption; provided further that each such redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of closing of each such Equity Offering. Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the redemption thereof, and any such redemption or notice may, at the Issuers discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of the related Equity Offering. The Trustee shall select the Senior Notes to be purchased in the manner described under Repurchase at the Option of HoldersSelection and Notice. Repurchase at the Option of Holders Change of Control The Senior Notes provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuer has previously or concurrently mailed a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Notes as described under Optional Redemption, the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the  Change of Control Offer ) at a price in cash (the  Change of Control Payment ) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Senior Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Senior Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register with a copy to the Trustee, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled Change of Control, and that all Senior Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the  Change of Control Payment Date ); (3) that any Senior Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Senior Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Senior Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Senior Notes, with the form entitled Option of Holder to Elect Purchase on the reverse of such Senior Notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Senior Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Senior Notes, provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the 30th day following the date of the Change of Control notice, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder of the Senior Notes, the principal amount of Senior Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Senior Notes and its election to have such Senior Notes purchased; (7) that if the Issuer is redeeming less than all of the Senior Notes, the Holders of the remaining Senior Notes will be issued new Senior Notes and such new Senior Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the Senior Notes must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple thereof; and 104 Table of Contents (8) the other instructions, as determined by us, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a Holder must follow. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Senior Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Senior Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Notes or portions thereof so tendered, and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Senior Notes so accepted together with an Officers Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Senior Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Senior Credit Facilities, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Senior Indebtedness to which the Issuer becomes a party may, provide that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under our Senior Credit Facilities, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance our Senior Credit Facilities. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities, such default could result in amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities being declared due and payable and cause a Receivables Facility to be wound-down. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Senior Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Senior Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and Certain CovenantsLiens. Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Senior Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything 105 Table of Contents to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of Change of Control includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Senior Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuers obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes. Asset Sales The Indenture provides that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, cause, make or suffer to exist an Asset Sale, unless: (1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and (2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of: (a) any liabilities (as shown on the Issuers or such Restricted Subsidiarys most recent balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Senior Notes, that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and for which the Issuer and all of its Restricted Subsidiaries have been validly released by all creditors in writing, (b) any securities received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of the cash received) within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale, and (c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed 2.5% of Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value, shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose. Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (1) to permanently reduce: (a) Obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities or the Senior Secured Notes; and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; (b) Obligations under Senior Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien, which Lien is permitted by the Indenture, and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; 106 Table of Contents (c) Obligations under other Senior Indebtedness (and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto), provided that the Issuer shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Senior Notes as provided under Optional Redemption, through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Senior Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of Senior Notes that would otherwise be prepaid; or (d) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary; (2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or another of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other assets, in each of (a), (b) and (c), used or useful in a Similar Business, or (3) to make an investment in (a) any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or another of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) properties or (c) acquisitions of other assets that, in each of (a), (b) and (c), replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; provided that, in the case of clauses (2) and (3) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Issuer, or such other Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an  Acceptable Commitment ) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a  Second Commitment ) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds. Any Net Proceeds from the Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute  Excess Proceeds . When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $100 million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all Holders of the Senior Notes and, if required by the terms of any Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Senior Notes ( Pari Passu Indebtedness ), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (an  Asset Sale Offer ), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is an integral multiple of $2,000 that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $100 million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Senior Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Senior Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. 107 Table of Contents Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Proceeds may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Senior Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Selection and Notice If the Issuer is redeeming less than all of the Senior Notes issued by it at any time, the Trustee will select the Senior Notes to be redeemed (a) if the Senior Notes are listed on any national securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which the Senior Notes are listed or (b) on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable. Notices of purchase or redemption shall be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the purchase or redemption date to each Holder of Senior Notes at such Holders registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Senior Note is to be purchased or redeemed in part only, any notice of purchase or redemption that relates to such Senior Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased or redeemed. The Issuer will issue a new Senior Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Senior Note in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original Senior Note. Senior Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Notes or portions of them called for redemption. Certain Covenants Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture. If on any date following the date of the Issue Date (i) the Senior Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies, and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture then, beginning on that day and continuing at all times thereafter regardless of any subsequent changes in the rating of the Senior Notes, the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this Description of Senior Notes section of this prospectus will no longer be applicable to the Senior Notes: (1) Repurchase at the Option of HoldersAsset Sales; (2) Limitation on Restricted Payments; (3) Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; (4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets; (5) Transactions with Affiliates; (6) Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries; and (7) Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries. 108 Table of Contents In addition, during any period of time that: (i) the Senior Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a  Covenant Suspension Event ), the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenant described under Repurchase at the Option of HoldersChange of Control (the  Suspended Covenant ). In the event that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenant under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the  Reversion Date ) one or both of the Rating Agencies (a) withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Senior Notes below an Investment Grade Rating and/or (b) the Issuer or any of its Affiliates enter into an agreement to effect a transaction that would result in a Change of Control and one or more of the Rating Agencies indicate that if consummated, such transaction (alone or together with any related recapitalization or refinancing transactions) would cause such Rating Agency to withdraw its Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the ratings assigned to the Senior Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenant under the Indenture with respect to future events, including, without limitation, a proposed transaction described in clause (b) above. There can be no assurance that the Senior Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

Reports and Other Information Notwithstanding that the Issuer may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, the Indenture requires the Issuer to file with the SEC (and make available to the Trustee and Holders of the Senior Notes (without exhibits), without cost to any Holder, within 15 days after it files them with the SEC) from and after the Issue Date, (1) within 90 days (or any other time period then in effect under the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act with respect to the filing of a Form 10-K by a non-accelerated filer) after the end of each fiscal year, annual reports on Form 10-K, or any successor or comparable form, containing the information required to be contained therein, or required in such successor or comparable form; (2) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, reports on Form 10-Q containing all quarterly information that would be required to be contained in Form 10-Q, or any successor or comparable form; (3) promptly from time to time after the occurrence of an event required to be therein reported, such other reports on Form 8-K, or any successor or comparable form; and (4) any other information, documents and other reports which the Issuer would be required to file with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; in each case, in a manner that complies in all material respects with the requirements specified in such form; provided that the Issuer shall not be so obligated to file such reports with the SEC if the SEC does not permit such filing, in which event the Issuer will make available such information to prospective purchasers of Senior Notes, in addition to providing such information to the Trustee and the Holders of the Senior Notes, in each case within 15 days after the time the Issuer would be required to file such information with the SEC, if it were subject to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer will agree that, for so long as any Senior Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. In the event that any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer becomes a guarantor of the Senior Notes, the Indenture will permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to such parent; provided that the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such requirements shall be deemed satisfied prior to the commencement of the exchange offers or the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement by the filing with the SEC of the exchange offer registration statement or shelf registration statement, and any amendments thereto, with such financial information that satisfies Regulation S-X of the Securities Act. Events of Default and Remedies The Indenture provides that each of the following is an Event of Default: (1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Senior Notes; 124 Table of Contents (2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest or Additional Interest on or with respect to the Senior Notes; (3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less 30% in principal amount of the Senior Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Senior Notes; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Senior Notes, if both: (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregate $100 million or more at any one time outstanding; (5) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $100 million, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed; (6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary; or (7) the Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect or be declared null and void or any responsible officer of any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, as the case may be, denies that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture. If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then total outstanding Senior Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Senior Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture provides that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Senior Notes if in the best judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the best interest of the Holders of the Senior Notes. The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Senior Notes waive any existing 125 Table of Contents Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Senior Note held by a non-consenting Holder. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Senior Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (2) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Senior Notes unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder of a Senior Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Senior Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the total outstanding Senior Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Senior Notes have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Senior Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Senior Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Senior Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Indenture provides that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within five Business Days, upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default. No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any of their parent companies has any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Senior Notes, the Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting Senior Notes waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy. 126 Table of Contents Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released upon payment in full of all of the Senior Notes. The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the Senior Notes and have the Issuer and each Guarantors obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee ( Legal Defeasance ) and cure all then existing Events of Default except for: (1) the rights of Holders of Senior Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the Indenture; (2) the Issuers obligations with respect to Senior Notes concerning issuing temporary Senior Notes, registration of such Senior Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust; (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuers obligations in connection therewith; and (4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture. In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of each Guarantor released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture ( Covenant Defeasance ) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default with respect to the Senior Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Issuer) described under Events of Default and Remedies will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes. In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Senior Notes: (1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Senior Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on the Senior Notes on the stated maturity date or on the redemption date, as the case may be, of such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such Senior Notes and the Issuer must specify whether such Senior Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date; (2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, (a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (b) since the issuance of the Senior Notes, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders of the Senior Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred; (3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders of the Senior Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income 127 Table of Contents tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to such tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred; (4) no Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit and the granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit; (5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Senior Subordinated Notes or the indenture pursuant to which the Senior Subordinated Notes were issued or any other material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which, the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound; (6) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to customary assumptions and exclusions following the deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of Section 547 of Title 11 of the United States Code; (7) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer or any Guarantor or others; and (8) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with. Satisfaction and Discharge The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Senior Notes, when either: (1) all Senior Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Notes which have been replaced or paid and Senior Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (2) (a) all Senior Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become due and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer and the Issuer or any Guarantor have irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of the Senior Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Senior Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption; (b) no Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit) with respect to the Indenture or the Senior Notes shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or shall occur as a result of such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under the Senior Credit Facilities, Senior Subordinated Notes (or the indenture under which the Senior Subordinated Notes are issued) or any other material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound; (c) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and (d) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Senior Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be. 128 Table of Contents In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied. Amendment, Supplement and Waiver Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, any Guarantee and the Senior Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding, including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Notes, and any existing Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Senior Notes issued thereunder may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes, other than Senior Notes beneficially owned by the Issuer or its Affiliates (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of or tender offer or exchange offer for the Senior Notes). The Indenture provides that, without the consent of each affected Holder of Senior Notes, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Notes held by a non-consenting Holder: (1) reduce the principal amount of such Senior Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such Senior Note or alter or waive the provisions with respect to the redemption of such Senior Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described above under the caption Repurchase at the Option of Holders); (3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Senior Note; (4) waive a Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Senior Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration, or in respect of a covenant or provision contained in the Indenture or any Guarantee which cannot be amended or modified without the consent of all Holders; (5) make any Senior Note payable in money other than that stated therein; (6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Senior Notes; (7) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions; (8) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of, or interest on such Holders Senior Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holders Senior Notes; (9) make any change to or modify the ranking of the Senior Notes that would adversely affect the Holders; or (10) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Guarantees of any Significant Subsidiary in any manner adverse to the Holders of the Senior Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee or the Indenture to which it is a party) and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture and any Guarantee or Senior Notes without the consent of any Holder; (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency; (2) to provide for uncertificated Senior Notes of such series in addition to or in place of certificated Senior Notes; 129 Table of Contents (3) to comply with the covenant relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; (4) to provide the assumption of the Issuers or any Guarantors obligations to the Holders; (5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder; (6) to add covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Guarantor; (7) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; (8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee thereunder pursuant to the requirements thereof; (9) to provide for the issuance of exchange notes or private exchange notes, which are identical to exchange notes except that they are not freely transferable; (10) to add a Guarantor under the Indenture; (11) to conform the text of the Indenture, Guarantees or the Senior Notes to any provision of this Description of Senior Notes to the extent that such provision in this Description of Senior Notes was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, Guarantee or Senior Notes; or (12) making any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Senior Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation to facilitate the issuance and administration of the Senior Notes; provided , however , that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Senior Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Senior Notes. The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. Notices Notices given by publication will be deemed given on the first date on which publication is made and notices given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given five calendar days after mailing. Concerning the Trustee The Indenture contains certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee is permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue or resign. The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default shall occur (which shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder of the Senior Notes, unless such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. 130 Table of Contents Governing Law The Indenture, the Senior Notes and any Guarantee are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

( SunGard ) and its consolidated Subsidiaries, assuming completion of the Transaction; and (ii) the term  Issuer  refers only to (a) prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, Solar Capital Corp. and not any of its Affiliates and (b) from and after the consummation of the Acquisition, SunGard Data Systems Inc. and not any of its Subsidiaries. The Issuer issued $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 10 1 / 4 % senior subordinated notes due 2015 (the  Senior Subordinated Notes ) under an indenture dated August 11, 2005 (the  Indenture ) among the Issuer, the Guarantors and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the  Trustee ). The Senior Subordinated Notes were issued in a private transaction that was not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Except as set forth herein, the terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes are substantially identical and include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act. The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of those agreements, including the definitions therein of certain terms used below. We urge you to read the Indenture because it, not this description, defines your rights as Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes. You may request copies of the Indenture at our address set forth under the heading Prospectus Summary. Brief Description of Senior Subordinated Notes The Senior Subordinated Notes are:  unsecured senior subordinated obligations of the Issuer;  subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future Senior Indebtedness (including the Senior Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes) of the Issuer;  effectively subordinated to all secured Indebtedness of the Issuer (including the Senior Credit Facilities and Senior Secured Notes);  senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes) of the Issuer;  initially guaranteed on an unsecured senior subordinated basis by each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Senior Credit Facilities; and  subject to registration with the SEC pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement. Guarantees The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, jointly and severally irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee, on an unsecured senior subordinated basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Senior Subordinated Notes, whether for payment of principal of or interest on or Additional Interest in respect of the Senior Subordinated Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture. 152 Table of Contents The Restricted Subsidiaries (other than as detailed below) guarantee the Senior Subordinated Notes. Each of the Guarantees of the Senior Subordinated Notes is a general unsecured obligation of each Guarantor, is subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of each such entity and is effectively subordinated to all secured Indebtedness of each such entity. The Senior Subordinated Notes are structurally subordinated to Indebtedness of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not Guarantee the Senior Subordinated Notes. Not all of the Issuers Subsidiaries Guarantee the Senior Subordinated Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer. None of our Foreign Subsidiaries, broker-dealer subsidiaries, non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (subject to certain limited exceptions) or any Receivables Subsidiary guarantee the Senior Subordinated Notes. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries generated 33% and 18% of SunGards total revenue and EBITDA, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2007, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries held 23% of SunGards consolidated assets. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantees are limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantees from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. Any entity that makes a payment under its Guarantee is entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantors pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. If a Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantors liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesFederal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and the related guarantees of the notes, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes. A Guarantee by a Guarantor shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) (a) any sale, exchange or transfer (by merger or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor (including any sale, exchange or transfer), after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or all or substantially all the assets of such Guarantor which sale, exchange or transfer is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (b) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Guarantor of the Senior Credit Facilities or the guarantee which resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee; (c) the proper designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; or (d) the Issuer exercising its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance or the Issuers obligations under the Indenture being discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; and (2) such Guarantor delivering to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with. 153 Table of Contents Ranking Senior Indebtedness Versus the Senior Subordinated Notes The payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes and the payment of any Guarantee are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment in cash in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, including the obligations of the Issuer and such Guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes. The Senior Subordinated Notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of the Issuers and the Guarantors existing and future Senior Indebtedness and effectively subordinated to all of the Issuers and the Guarantors existing and future Secured Indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness. As of December 31, 2007, SunGard had $6,015 million of Senior Indebtedness (of which $4,874 million was secured Indebtedness, consisting entirely of secured Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes (which have a face amount of $500 million, but are recorded at $470 million and were secured as of the Issue Date)). As of December 31, 2007, $441 million of funding also was outstanding under our Receivables Facility. Although the Indenture contains limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Issuer and the Guarantors may incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial and, in any case, such Indebtedness may be Senior Indebtedness. See Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock. Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Subordinated Notes The Issuer maintains one or more paying agents for the Senior Subordinated Notes in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York. The initial paying agent for the Senior Subordinated Notes is the Trustee. The Issuer also maintains a registrar with offices in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York. The initial registrar is the Trustee. The registrar maintains a register reflecting ownership of the Senior Subordinated Notes outstanding from time to time and makes payments on and facilitate transfer of Senior Subordinated Notes on behalf of the Issuer. The Issuer may change the paying agents or the registrars without prior notice to the Holders. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent or registrar. Subordination of the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor that is Senior Indebtedness will rank senior to the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Guarantees in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. The Senior Subordinated Notes and Guarantees will in all respects rank pari passu with all other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer and the relevant Guarantor, respectively. We agree in the Indenture that the Issuer and the Guarantors will not incur any Indebtedness that is subordinate or junior in right of payment to the Senior Indebtedness of such Person, unless such Indebtedness is Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the applicable Person or is expressly subordinated in right of payment to Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of such Person. The Indenture does not treat (i) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (ii) Senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral. Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor is permitted to pay principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes (or pay any other obligations relating to the Senior Subordinated Notes, including 154 Table of Contents Additional Interest, fees, costs, expenses, indemnities and rescission or damage claims) or make any deposit pursuant to the provisions described under Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance or Satisfaction and Discharge below and may not purchase, redeem or otherwise retire any Senior Subordinated Notes (collectively,  pay the notes ) (except in the form of Permitted Junior Securities) if either of the following occurs (a  Payment Default ): (1) any Obligation on any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer is not paid in full in cash when due (after giving effect to any applicable grace period); or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms; unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash. Regardless of the foregoing, the Issuer is permitted to pay the Senior Subordinated Notes if the Issuer and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representatives of all Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing. During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) (a  Non-Payment Default ) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, the Issuer is not permitted to pay the Senior Subordinated Notes (except in the form of Permitted Junior Securities) for a period (a  Payment Blockage Period ) commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee (with a copy to the Issuer) of written notice (a  Blockage Notice ) of such Non-Payment Default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. The Payment Blockage Period will end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated: (1) by written notice to the Trustee and the Issuer from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (3) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash. Notwithstanding the provisions described above, unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, the Issuer and related Guarantors are permitted to resume paying the Senior Subordinated Notes after the end of such Payment Blockage Period. The Senior Subordinated Notes shall not be subject to more than one Payment Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness during such period; provided that if any Blockage Notice is delivered to the Trustee by or on behalf of the holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than the holders of Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities), a Representative of holders of Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities may give another Blockage Notice within such period. However, in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods on the Senior Subordinated Notes is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be at least 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Blockage Notice to the Trustee will be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Blockage Notice unless such default has been waived for a period of not less than 90 days (it being acknowledged that any subsequent action, or any breach of any financial covenants during the period after the date of delivery of a Blockage Notice, that, in either case, would give rise to a Non-Payment Default pursuant to any provisions under which a Non-Payment Default previously existed or was continuing shall constitute a new Non-Payment Default for this purpose). 155 Table of Contents In connection with the Senior Subordinated Notes, in the event of any payment or distribution of the assets of the Issuer upon a total or partial liquidation or dissolution or reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to the Issuer or its property: (1) the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer will be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of such Senior Indebtedness before the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes are entitled to receive any payment; (2) until the Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer is paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes would be entitled but for the subordination provisions of the Indenture will be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Holders of Senior Subordinated Notes may receive Permitted Junior Securities; and (3) if a distribution is made to Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes that, due to the subordination provisions, should not have been made to them, such Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes are required to hold it in trust for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and pay it over to them as their interests may appear. The subordination and payment blockage provisions described above will not prevent a Default from occurring under the Indenture upon the failure of the Issuer to pay interest or principal with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes when due by their terms. If payment of the Senior Subordinated Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Issuer must promptly notify the holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness of the acceleration. So long as there shall remain outstanding any Senior Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities, a Blockage Notice may be given only by the administrative agent thereunder unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the requisite lenders named therein. If any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer is outstanding, neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor may pay the Senior Subordinated Notes until five Business Days after the Representatives of all the issuers of such Designated Senior Indebtedness receive notice of such acceleration and, thereafter, may pay the Senior Subordinated Notes only if the Indenture otherwise permits payment at that time. Each Guarantors obligations under its Guarantee are senior subordinated obligations of that Guarantor. As such, the rights of Holders to receive payment pursuant to such Guarantee will be subordinated in right of payment to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor. The terms of the subordination and payment blockage provisions described above with respect to the Issuers obligations under the Senior Subordinated Notes apply equally to the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee. A Holder by its acceptance of Senior Subordinated Notes agrees to be bound by such provisions and authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee, on its behalf, to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided for in the Indenture and appoints the Trustee its attorney-in-fact for such purpose. By reason of the subordination provisions contained in the Indenture, in the event of a liquidation or insolvency proceeding, creditors of the Issuer or a Guarantor who are holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, may recover more, ratably, than the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes, and creditors who are not holders of Senior Indebtedness may recover less, ratably, than holders of Senior Indebtedness and may recover more, ratably, than the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes. The terms of the subordination provisions described above will not apply to payments from money or the proceeds of Government Securities held in trust by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes pursuant to the provisions described under Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance or Satisfaction and Discharge, if the foregoing subordination provisions were not violated at the time the applicable amounts were deposited in trust pursuant to such provisions. 156 Table of Contents Transfer and Exchange A Holder may transfer or exchange Senior Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of Senior Subordinated Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Senior Subordinated Note selected for redemption. Also, the Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Senior Subordinated Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of Senior Subordinated Notes to be redeemed. Principal, Maturity and Interest The Issuer issued $1,000 million of Senior Subordinated Notes in this offering. The Senior Subordinated Notes mature on August 15, 2015. Subject to compliance with the covenant described below under the caption Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock, the Issuer may issue additional Senior Subordinated Notes from time to time after this offering under the Indenture ( Additional Senior Subordinated Notes ). The Senior Subordinated Notes offered by the Issuer and any Additional Senior Subordinated Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to Senior Subordinated Notes for all purposes of the Indenture and this Description of Senior Subordinated Notes include any Additional Senior Subordinated Notes that are actually issued. Interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes accrues at the rate of 10 1 / 4 % per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15, commencing on February 15, 2006 to the Holders of Senior Subordinated Notes of record on the immediately preceding February 1 and August 1. Interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes accrues from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date. Interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes is computed on the basis of a 360 day year comprised of twelve 30 day months. Additional Interest Additional Interest may accrue on the Senior Subordinated Notes in certain circumstances pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. All references in the Indenture, in any context, to any interest or other amount payable on or with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes shall be deemed to include any Additional Interest pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes are payable at the office or agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose within the City and State of New York or, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee are made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holder or Holders thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Issuer, the Issuers office or agency in New York is the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose. Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases The Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Senior Subordinated Notes as described under the caption Repurchase at the Option of Holders. We may at any time and from time to time purchase Senior Subordinated Notes in the open market or otherwise. 157 Table of Contents Optional Redemption Except as set forth below, the Issuer is not entitled to redeem the Senior Subordinated Notes at its option prior to August 15, 2010. At any time prior to August 15, 2010 the Issuer may redeem all or a part of the Senior Subordinated Notes, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice mailed by first-class mail to the registered address of each Holder, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date of redemption (the  Redemption Date ), subject to the rights of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. On and after August 15, 2010 the Issuer may redeem the Senior Subordinated Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under the heading Repurchase at the Option of HoldersSelection and Notice at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Interest, if any, to the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on August 15 of each of the years indicated below: Year Percentage 2010 105.125 % 2011 103.417 % 2012 101.708 % 2013 and thereafter 100.000 % In addition, until August 15, 2008, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes issued by it at a redemption price equal to 110.25% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Interest, if any, to the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of Senior Subordinated Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided that at least 50% of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes originally issued under the Indenture and any Additional Senior Subordinated Notes that are Senior Subordinated Notes issued under the Indenture after the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption; provided further that each such redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of closing of each such Equity Offering. Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the redemption thereof, and any such redemption or notice may, at the Issuers discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of the related Equity Offering. The Trustee shall select the Senior Subordinated Notes to be purchased in the manner described under Repurchase at the Option of HoldersSelection and Notice. Repurchase at the Option of Holders Change of Control The Senior Subordinated Notes provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuer has previously or concurrently mailed a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes as described under Optional Redemption, the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Subordinated Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the  Change of Control Offer ) at a price in cash (the  Change of Control Payment ) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and 158 Table of Contents Additional Interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Senior Subordinated Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register with a copy to the Trustee, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled Change of Control, and that all Senior Subordinated Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the  Change of Control Payment Date ); (3) that any Senior Subordinated Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Senior Subordinated Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Senior Subordinated Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Senior Subordinated Notes, with the form entitled Option of Holder to Elect Purchase on the reverse of such Senior Subordinated Notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Senior Subordinated Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Senior Subordinated Notes, provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the 30th day following the date of the Change of Control notice, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder of the Senior Subordinated Notes, the principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Senior Subordinated Notes and its election to have such Senior Subordinated Notes purchased; (7) that if the Issuer is redeeming less than all of the Senior Subordinated Notes, the Holders of the remaining Senior Subordinated Notes will be issued new Senior Subordinated Notes and such new Senior Subordinated Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Subordinated Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the Senior Subordinated Notes must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple thereof; and (8) the other instructions, as determined by us, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a Holder must follow. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Senior Subordinated Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Senior Subordinated Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Subordinated Notes or portions thereof so tendered, and 159 Table of Contents (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Senior Subordinated Notes so accepted together with an Officers Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Senior Subordinated Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Senior Credit Facilities and Senior Notes limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Senior Indebtedness to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Senior Subordinated Notes as a result of a Change of Control. The Senior Secured Notes do not currently have any such limitations. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Senior Subordinated Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders and the holders of the Senior Notes to permit the purchase of the Senior Subordinated Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing the Senior Subordinated Notes. In such case, the Issuers failure to purchase tendered Senior Subordinated Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. If, as a result thereof, a default occurs with respect to any Senior Indebtedness, the subordination provisions in the Indenture would restrict payments to the Holders of Senior Subordinated Notes under certain circumstances. The Senior Credit Facilities provide that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under our Senior Credit Facilities, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance our Senior Credit Facilities. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities, such default could result in amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities being declared due and payable and cause a Receivables Facility to be wound-down. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Senior Subordinated Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Senior Subordinated Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. After the Issue Date, we have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and Certain CovenantsLiens. Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Senior Subordinated Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of Change of Control includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances 160 Table of Contents there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Senior Subordinated Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Subordinated Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuers obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Subordinated Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes. Asset Sales The Indenture provides that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, cause, make or suffer to exist an Asset Sale, unless: (1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and (2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of: (a) any liabilities (as shown on the Issuers or such Restricted Subsidiarys most recent balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Senior Subordinated Notes, that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and for which the Issuer and all of its Restricted Subsidiaries have been validly released by all creditors in writing, (b) any securities received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of the cash received) within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale, and (c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed 2.5% of Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value, shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose. Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (1) to permanently reduce: (a) Obligations under the Senior Indebtedness, and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; (b) Obligations under Senior Subordinated Indebtedness (and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto); provided that the Issuer shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Senior Subordinated Notes as provided under Optional Redemption, through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders of Senior Subordinated Notes to purchase their Senior Subordinated Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of Senior Subordinated Notes that would otherwise be prepaid, or 161 Table of Contents (c) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary, (2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or another of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other assets, in each of (a), (b) and (c), used or useful in a Similar Business, or (3) to make an investment in (a) any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or another of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) properties or (c) acquisitions of other assets that, in each of (a), (b) and (c), replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; provided that, in the case of clauses (2) and (3) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Issuer, or such other Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an  Acceptable Commitment ) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a  Second Commitment ) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds. Any Net Proceeds from the Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute  Excess Proceeds . When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $100 million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes and, if required by the terms of any Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Senior Subordinated Notes ( Pari Passu Indebtedness ), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (an  Asset Sale Offer ), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is an integral multiple of $2,000 that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $100 million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Subordinated Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Senior Subordinated Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Proceeds may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with 162 Table of Contents the repurchase of the Senior Subordinated Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Senior Credit Facilities and Senior Notes limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Senior Indebtedness to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Senior Subordinated Notes pursuant to this Asset Sales covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Senior Subordinated Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders and the holders of the Senior Notes to the purchase of the Senior Subordinated Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Senior Subordinated Notes. In such case, the Issuers failure to purchase tendered Senior Subordinated Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. If, as a result thereof, a default occurs with respect to any Senior Indebtedness, the subordination provisions in the Indenture would restrict payments to the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes under certain circumstances. Selection and Notice If the Issuer is redeeming less than all of the Senior Subordinated Notes issued by it at any time, the Trustee will select the Senior Subordinated Notes to be redeemed (a) if the Senior Subordinated Notes are listed on any national securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which the Senior Subordinated Notes are listed or (b) on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable. Notices of purchase or redemption shall be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the purchase or redemption date to each Holder of Senior Subordinated Notes at such Holders registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Subordinated Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Senior Subordinated Note is to be purchased or redeemed in part only, any notice of purchase or redemption that relates to such Senior Subordinated Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased or redeemed. The Issuer will issue a new Senior Subordinated Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Senior Subordinated Note in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original Senior Subordinated Note. Senior Subordinated Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Subordinated Notes or portions of them called for redemption. Certain Covenants Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture. If on any date following the date of the Issue Date (i) the Senior Subordinated Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies, and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture then, beginning on that day and continuing at all times thereafter regardless of any subsequent changes in the rating of the Senior Subordinated Notes, the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this Description of Senior Subordinated Notes section of this prospectus will no longer be applicable to the Senior Subordinated Notes: (1) Repurchase at the Option of HoldersAsset Sales; (2) Limitation on Restricted Payments; (3) Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; (4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets; 163 Table of Contents (5) Transactions with Affiliates; (6) Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries; (7) Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries; and (8) Limitation on Layering. In addition, during any period of time that: (i) the Senior Subordinated Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a  Covenant Suspension Event ), the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenant described under Repurchase at the Option of HoldersChange of Control (the  Suspended Covenant ). In the event that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenant under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the  Reversion Date ) one or both of the Rating Agencies (a) withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Senior Subordinated Notes below an Investment Grade Rating and/or (b) the Issuer or any of its Affiliates enter into an agreement to effect a transaction that would result in a Change of Control and one or more of the Rating Agencies indicate that if consummated, such transaction (alone or together with any related recapitalization or refinancing transactions) would cause such Rating Agency to withdraw its Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the ratings assigned to the Senior Subordinated Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenant under the Indenture with respect to future events, including, without limitation, a proposed transaction described in clause (b) above. There can be no assurance that the Senior Subordinated Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings. Limitation on Restricted Payments The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly: (I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the Issuers, or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Equity Interests, including any dividend or distribution payable in connection with any merger or consolidation other than: (a) dividends or distributions by the Issuer payable solely in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer; or (b) dividends or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any dividend or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities; (II) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer, including in connection with any merger or consolidation; (III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness, other than: (a) Indebtedness permitted under clauses (7) and (8) of the covenant described under Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; or (b) the purchase, repurchase or other acquisition of Subordinated Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase or acquisition;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, the Issuer could incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness under the provisions of the first paragraph of the covenant described under Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; and (3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date (including Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (1), (2) (with respect to the payment of dividends on Refunding Capital Stock (as defined below) pursuant to clause (b) thereof only), (6)(c), (9) and (14) of the next succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of (without duplication): (a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting period) beginning July 1, 2005, to the end of the Issuers most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment, or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit;

and (y) Designated Preferred Stock and (B) to the extent such net cash proceeds are actually contributed to the Issuer, Equity Interests of the Issuers direct or indirect parent companies (excluding contributions of the proceeds from the sale of Designated Preferred Stock of such companies or contributions to the extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted Payments made in accordance with clause (4) of the next succeeding paragraph);

or (ii) the sale (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) of the stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a distribution from an Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than in each case to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to clause (7) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the extent such Investment constituted a Permitted Investment) or a dividend from an Unrestricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date;

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit: (1) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof, if at the date of declaration such payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture; (2) (a) the redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition of any Equity Interests ( Treasury Capital Stock ) or Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Equity Interests of any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer, in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of, Equity Interests of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer to the extent contributed to the Issuer (in each case, other than any Disqualified Stock) ( Refunding Capital Stock ) and (b) if immediately prior to the retirement of Treasury Capital Stock, the declaration and payment of dividends thereon was permitted under clause (6) of this paragraph, the declaration and payment of dividends on the Refunding Capital Stock (other than Refunding Capital Stock the proceeds of which were used to redeem, repurchase, retire or otherwise acquire any Equity Interests of any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer) in an aggregate amount per year no greater than the aggregate amount of dividends per annum that were declarable and payable on such Treasury Capital Stock immediately prior to such retirement;

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuers Subsidiaries were Restricted Subsidiaries. The Issuer will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the last sentence of the definition of Unrestricted Subsidiary. For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount determined as set forth in the last sentence of the definition of Investment. Such designation will be permitted only if a Restricted Payment in such amount would be permitted at such time, whether pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or under clause (7), (10), (11) or (16) of the second paragraph of this covenant, or pursuant to the definition of Permitted Investments, and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

Limitation on Layering The Indenture provides that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is subordinate in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is either: (1) equal in right of payment with the Senior Subordinated Notes or such Guarantors Guarantee of the Senior Subordinated Notes, as the case may be; or 178 Table of Contents (2) expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Subordinated Notes or such Guarantors Guarantee of the Senior Subordinated Notes, as the case may be. The Indenture does not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral. Reports and Other Information Notwithstanding that the Issuer may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, the Indenture requires the Issuer to file with the SEC (and make available to the Trustee and Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes (without exhibits), without cost to any Holder, within 15 days after it files them with the SEC) from and after the Issue Date, (1) within 90 days (or any other time period then in effect under the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act with respect to the filing of a Form 10-K by a non-accelerated filer) after the end of each fiscal year, annual reports on Form 10-K, or any successor or comparable form, containing the information required to be contained therein, or required in such successor or comparable form; (2) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, reports on Form 10-Q containing all quarterly information that would be required to be contained in Form 10-Q, or any successor or comparable form; (3) promptly from time to time after the occurrence of an event required to be therein reported, such other reports on Form 8-K, or any successor or comparable form; and (4) any other information, documents and other reports which the Issuer would be required to file with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; in each case, in a manner that complies in all material respects with the requirements specified in such form; provided that the Issuer shall not be so obligated to file such reports with the SEC if the SEC does not permit such filing, in which event the Issuer will make available such information to prospective purchasers of Senior Subordinated Notes, in addition to providing such information to the Trustee and the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes, in each case within 15 days after the time the Issuer would be required to file such information with the SEC, if it were subject to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer will agree that, for so long as any Senior Subordinated Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. In the event that any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer becomes a guarantor of the Senior Subordinated Notes, the Indenture permits the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to such parent; provided that the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such requirements shall be deemed satisfied prior to the commencement of the exchange offer or the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement by the filing with the SEC of the exchange offer registration statement or shelf registration statement, and any amendments thereto, with such financial information that satisfies Regulation S-X of the Securities Act. 179 Table of Contents Events of Default and Remedies The Indenture provides that each of the following is an Event of Default: (1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Senior Subordinated Notes (whether or not prohibited by the subordination provisions of the Indenture); (2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest or Additional Interest on or with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes (whether or not prohibited by the subordination provisions of the Indenture); (3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less 30% in principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Senior Subordinated Notes; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Senior Subordinated Notes, if both: (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregate $100 million or more at any one time outstanding; (5) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $100 million, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed; (6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary; or (7) the Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect or be declared null and void or any responsible officer of any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, as the case may be, denies that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture. If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then total outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes to be due and payable immediately; provided , however , that so long as any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture as part of the Senior Credit Facilities shall be outstanding, no such acceleration shall be effective until the earlier of: (1) acceleration of any such Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities; or (2) five Business Days after the giving of written notice of such acceleration to the Issuer and the administrative agent under the Senior Credit Facilities. 180 Table of Contents Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture provides that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Senior Subordinated Notes if in the best judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the best interest of the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes. The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Senior Subordinated Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Senior Subordinated Note held by a non-consenting Holder. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Senior Subordinated Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (2) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder of a Senior Subordinated Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Senior Subordinated Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the total outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Senior Subordinated Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Indenture provides that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within five Business Days, upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default. 181 Table of Contents No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any of their parent companies shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Senior Subordinated Notes, the Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting Senior Subordinated Notes waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Subordinated Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy. Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released upon payment in full of all of the Senior Subordinated Notes. The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes and have the Issuer and each Guarantors obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee ( Legal Defeasance ) and cure all then existing Events of Default except for: (1) the rights of Holders of Senior Subordinated Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the Indenture; (2) the Issuers obligations with respect to Senior Subordinated Notes concerning issuing temporary Senior Subordinated Notes, registration of such Senior Subordinated Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Subordinated Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust; (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuers obligations in connection therewith; and (4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture. In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of each Guarantor released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture ( Covenant Defeasance ) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Issuer) described under Events of Default and Remedies will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes. In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes: (1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on the Senior Subordinated Notes on the stated maturity date or on the redemption date, as the case may be, of such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such Senior Subordinated Notes and the Issuer must specify whether such Senior Subordinated Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date; (2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, (a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (b) since the issuance of the Senior Subordinated Notes, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of 182 Table of Contents Counsel shall confirm that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred; (3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to such tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred; (4) no Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit and the granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit; (5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Senior Notes or the indenture pursuant to which the Senior Notes were issued or any other material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which, the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound; (6) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to customary assumptions and exclusions following the deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of Section 547 of Title 11 of the United States Code; (7) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer or any Guarantor or others; and (8) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with. Satisfaction and Discharge The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Senior Subordinated Notes, when either: (1) all Senior Subordinated Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Subordinated Notes which have been replaced or paid and Senior Subordinated Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (2) (a) all Senior Subordinated Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become due and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer and the Issuer or any Guarantor have irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Senior Subordinated Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption; 183 Table of Contents (b) no Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit) with respect to the Indenture or the Senior Subordinated Notes shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or shall occur as a result of such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under the Senior Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the Senior Notes or any other material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound; (c) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and (d) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Senior Subordinated Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be. In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied. Amendment, Supplement and Waiver Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, any Guarantee and the Senior Subordinated Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes then outstanding, including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Subordinated Notes, and any existing Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Senior Subordinated Notes issued thereunder may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes, other than Senior Subordinated Notes beneficially owned by the Issuer or its Affiliates (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of or tender offer or exchange offer for the Senior Subordinated Notes). The Indenture provides that, without the consent of each affected Holder of Senior Subordinated Notes, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Subordinated Notes held by a non-consenting Holder: (1) reduce the principal amount of such Senior Subordinated Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such Senior Subordinated Note or alter or waive the provisions with respect to the redemption of such Senior Subordinated Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described above under the caption Repurchase at the Option of Holders); (3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Senior Subordinated Note; (4) waive a Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Subordinated Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration, or in respect of a covenant or provision contained in the Indenture or any Guarantee which cannot be amended or modified without the consent of all Holders; (5) make any Senior Subordinated Note payable in money other than that stated therein; (6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes; (7) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions; (8) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of, or interest on such Holders Senior Subordinated Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holders Senior Subordinated Notes; 184 Table of Contents (9) make any change in the subordination provisions thereof that would adversely affect the Holders; or (10) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Guarantees of any Significant Subsidiary in any manner adverse to the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee or the Indenture to which it is a party) and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture and any Guarantee or Senior Subordinated Notes without the consent of any Holder; (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency; (2) to provide for uncertificated Senior Subordinated Notes of such series in addition to or in place of certificated Senior Subordinated Notes; (3) to comply with the covenant relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; (4) to provide the assumption of the Issuers or any Guarantors obligations to the Holders; (5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder; (6) to add covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Guarantor; (7) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; (8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee thereunder pursuant to the requirements thereof; (9) to provide for the issuance of exchange notes or private exchange notes, which are identical to exchange notes except that they are not freely transferable; (10) to add a Guarantor under the Indenture; (11) to conform the text of the Indenture, Guarantees or the Senior Subordinated Notes to any provision of this Description of Senior Subordinated Notes to the extent that such provision in this Description of Senior Subordinated Notes was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, Guarantee or Senior Subordinated Notes; or (12) making any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Senior Subordinated Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation to facilitate the issuance and administration of the Senior Subordinated Notes; provided , however , that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Senior Subordinated Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Senior Subordinated Notes. The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. Notices Notices given by publication will be deemed given on the first date on which publication is made and notices given by first- class mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given five calendar days after mailing. Concerning the Trustee The Indenture contains certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in 185 Table of Contents respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee is permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue or resign. The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default shall occur (which shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder of the Senior Subordinated Notes, unless such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Governing Law The Indenture, the Senior Subordinated Notes and any Guarantee are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. Certain Definitions Set forth below are certain defined terms used in the Indenture. For purposes of the Indenture, unless otherwise specifically indicated, the term consolidated with respect to any Person refers to such Person consolidated with its Restricted Subsidiaries, and excludes from such consolidation any Unrestricted Subsidiary as if such Unrestricted Subsidiary were not an Affiliate of such Person.  Acquired Indebtedness  means, with respect to any specified Person, (1) Indebtedness of any other Person existing at the time such other Person is merged with or into or became a Restricted Subsidiary of such specified Person, including Indebtedness incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such other Person merging with or into or becoming a Restricted Subsidiary of such specified Person, and (2) Indebtedness secured by a Lien encumbering any asset acquired by such specified Person.  Acquisition  means the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement.  Additional Interest  means all additional interest then owing pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement.  Affiliate  of any specified Person means any other Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with such specified Person.

and (2) the excess, if any, of (a) the present value at such Redemption Date of (i) the redemption price of such Senior Note at August 15, 2009 (such redemption price being set forth in the table appearing above 186 Table of Contents under the caption Optional Redemption), plus (ii) all required interest payments due on such Senior Note through August 15, 2009 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the Redemption Date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate as of such Redemption Date plus 50 basis points;

The Issuer may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that, immediately after giving effect to such designation, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing and either: (1) the Issuer could incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test described in the first paragraph under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; or (2) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer its Restricted Subsidiaries would be greater than such ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such designation, in each case on a pro forma basis taking into account such designation. Any such designation by the Issuer shall be notified by the Issuer to the Trustee by promptly filing with the Trustee a copy of the resolution of the board of directors of the Issuer or any committee thereof giving effect to such designation and an Officers Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the foregoing provisions.  Voting Stock  of any Person as of any date means the Capital Stock of such Person that is at the time entitled to vote in the election of the board of directors of such Person.  Weighted Average Life to Maturity  means, when applied to any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, at any date, the quotient obtained by dividing: (1) the sum of the products of the number of years from the date of determination to the date of each successive scheduled principal payment of such Indebtedness or redemption or similar payment with respect to such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock multiplied by the amount of such payment; by (2) the sum of all such payments.  Wholly-Owned Subsidiary  of any Person means a Subsidiary of such Person, 100% of the outstanding Equity Interests of which (other than directors qualifying shares) shall at the time be owned by such Person or by one or more Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries of such Person. 206 Table of Contents CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME AND ESTATE TAX CONSEQUENCES The following is a summary of certain United States federal income and, in the case of Non-United States Holders (as defined below), estate tax consequences of the ownership of notes as of the date hereof. Except where noted, this summary deals only with notes that are held as capital assets, and does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including if you are:  a dealer in securities or currencies;  a financial institution;  a regulated investment company;  a real estate investment trust;  a tax-exempt organization;  an insurance company;  a person holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle;  a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;  a person liable for alternative minimum tax;  a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes;  a United States Holder (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;  a controlled foreign corporation;  a passive foreign investment company; or  a United States expatriate. This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income and estate tax consequences different from those summarized below. If a partnership holds notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding notes, you should consult your tax advisors. This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income and estate tax consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the effects of any state, local or non-United States tax laws. If you are considering the purchase of notes, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular United States federal income and estate tax consequences to you of the ownership of the notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction. Consequences to United States Holders The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will apply to you if you are a United States Holder of notes. 207 Table of Contents Certain consequences to Non-United States Holders of notes, which are beneficial owners of notes (other than partnerships) who are not United States Holders, are described under Consequences to Non-United States Holders below. United States Holder means a beneficial owner of a note that is for United States federal income tax purposes:  an individual citizen or resident of the United States;  a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or  a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. Payments of Interest Interest on a note will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for tax purposes. Market Discount If you purchase a note for an amount that is less than its stated redemption price at maturity, the amount of the difference will be treated as market discount for United States federal income tax purposes, unless that difference is less than a specified de minimus amount. Under the market discount rules, you will be required to treat any principal payment on, or any gain on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of, a note as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that you have not previously included in income and are treated as having accrued on the note at the time of its payment or disposition. In addition, you may be required to defer, until the maturity of the note or its earlier disposition in a taxable transaction, the deduction of all or a portion of the interest expense on any indebtedness attributable to the note. You may elect, on a note-by-note basis, to deduct the deferred interest expense in a tax year prior to the year of disposition. You should consult your own tax advisors before making this election. Any market discount will be considered to accrue ratably during the period from the date of acquisition to the maturity date of the note, unless you elect to accrue on a constant interest method. You may elect to include market discount in income currently as it accrues, on either a ratable or constant interest method, in which case the rule described above regarding deferral of interest deductions will not apply. Amortizable Bond Premium If you purchase a note for an amount in excess of its stated redemption price at maturity, you will be considered to have purchased the note at a premium. You generally may elect to amortize the premium over the remaining term of the note on a constant yield method as an offset to interest when includible in income under your regular accounting method. If you do not elect to amortize bond premium, that premium will decrease the gain or increase the loss you would otherwise recognize on disposition of the note. 208 Table of Contents Sale, Exchange and Retirement of Notes Your adjusted tax basis in a note will, in general, be your cost for that note, increased by any market discount that you previously included in income, and reduced by any amortized premium. Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note, you will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount you realize upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included in income) and the adjusted tax basis of the note. Except as described above with respect to market discount, that gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of individuals derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Consequences to Non-United States Holders The following is a summary of certain United States federal income and estate tax consequences that will apply to you if you are a Non-United States Holder of notes. United States Federal Withholding Tax The 30% United States federal withholding tax will not apply to any payment of interest on the notes under the portfolio interest rule, provided that:  interest paid on the notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States;  you do not actually (or constructively) own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock within the meaning of the Code and applicable United States Treasury regulations;  you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to us through stock ownership;  you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; and  either (a) you provide your name and address on an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form W-8BEN (or other applicable form), and certify, under penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person as defined under the Code or (b) you hold your notes through certain foreign intermediaries and satisfy the certification requirements of applicable United States Treasury regulations. Special certification rules apply to Non-United States Holders that are pass-through entities rather than corporations or individuals. If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be subject to the 30% United States federal withholding tax, unless you provide us with a properly executed:  IRS Form W-8BEN (or other applicable form) claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty; or  IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) stating that interest paid on the notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (as discussed below under United States Federal Income Tax). The 30% United States federal withholding tax generally will not apply to payment of principal or any gain that you realize on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of a note. 209 Table of Contents United States Federal Income Tax If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest or premium on the notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment), then you will be subject to United States federal income tax on that interest or premium on a net income basis (although you will be exempt from the 30% United States federal withholding tax, provided the certification requirements discussed above in United States Federal Withholding Tax are satisfied) generally in the same manner as if you were a United States person as defined under the Code. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of such interest or premium, subject to adjustments. Any gain realized on the disposition of a note generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax unless:  the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment); or  you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that disposition, and certain other conditions are met. United States Federal Estate Tax Your estate will not be subject to United States federal estate tax on notes beneficially owned by you at the time of your death, provided that any payment to you on the notes would be eligible for exemption from the 30% United States federal withholding tax under the portfolio interest rule described above under United States Federal Withholding Tax without regard to the statement requirement described in the fifth bullet point of that section. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding United States Holders In general, information reporting requirements will apply to certain payments of principal, interest and premium paid on notes and to the proceeds of sale of a note paid to you (unless you are an exempt recipient such as a corporation). A backup withholding tax may apply to such payments if you fail to provide a taxpayer identification number or a certification of exempt status, or if you fail to report in full dividend and interest income. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is furnished in a timely manner to the IRS. Non-United States Holders Generally, we must report to the IRS and to you the amount of interest paid to you and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which you reside under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. In general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments on the notes that we make to you provided that we do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person as defined under the Code, and we have received from you the statement described above in the fifth bullet point under Consequences to Non-United States HoldersUnited States Federal Withholding Tax. 210 Table of Contents Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the proceeds of a sale (including retirement or redemption) of our notes within the United States or conducted through certain United States-related financial intermediaries, unless you certify under penalties of perjury that you are not a United States person as defined under the Code (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person as defined under the Code) or you otherwise establish an exemption. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is furnished in a timely manner to the IRS. 211 Table of Contents CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the notes by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws, rules or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, Similar Laws), and entities whose underlying assets are considered to include plan assets (within the meaning of ERISA) of any such plan, account or arrangement (each, a Plan). General Fiduciary Matters ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an ERISA Plan) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciarys duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. Prohibited Transaction Issues Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are parties in interest, within the meaning of ERISA, or disqualified persons, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we are considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the United States Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (PTCEs) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14, respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1, respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38, respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60, respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23, respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the ERISA Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing plan assets of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws. 212 Table of Contents Representation Accordingly, by acceptance of a note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the notes constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the purchase and holding of the notes by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or any similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the notes (and holding or disposing the notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase, holding and disposition of the notes. 213 Table of Contents PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION This prospectus is to be used by Goldman, Sachs & Co. in connection with offers and sales of the notes in market-making transactions effected from time to time.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies SunGard Data Systems Inc. (SunGard or the company) was acquired on August 11, 2005 (the Transaction) by a consortium of private equity investment funds associated with Bain Capital Partners, The Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs & Co., Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Providence Equity Partners, Silver Lake and Texas Pacific Group (collectively, the Sponsors). The Transaction was accomplished through the merger of Solar Capital Corp. into SunGard with SunGard being the surviving company. SunGard is a wholly owned subsidiary of SunGard Holdco LLC, which is wholly owned by SunGard Holding Corp., which is wholly owned by SunGard Capital Corp. II, which is a subsidiary of SunGard Capital Corp. The term Parent Companies collectively refers to SunGard Capital Corp. and SunGard Capital Corp. II, as used herein. All of these companies were formed for the purpose of facilitating the Transaction and are collectively referred to as the holding companies. Although SunGard continued as the same legal entity after the Transaction, the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders equity are presented for two periods: Predecessor and Successor, which relate to the period preceding the Transaction and the period succeeding the Transaction, respectively. The company refers to the operations of SunGard and subsidiaries for both the Predecessor and Successor periods. All references to the period from January 1, 2005 through August 10, 2005 are for the Predecessor. SunGard has four reportable segments: Financial Systems (FS), Higher Education (HE), Public Sector (PS) and Availability Services (AS). The companys Software & Processing Solutions business is comprised of the FS, HE and PS segments. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements exclude the accounts of the holding companies. Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. The company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and revises them when necessary. Actual results may differ from the original or revised estimates. The company amortizes identifiable intangible assets over periods that it believes approximate the related useful lives of those assets based upon estimated future operating results and cash flows of the underlying business operations. The company closely monitors estimates of those lives, which could change due to many factors, including product demand, market conditions, technological developments, economic conditions and competition. The presentation of certain prior year amounts has been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Revenue Recognition The following criteria must be met in determining whether revenue may be recorded: persuasive evidence of a contract exists; services have been provided; the price is known; and collection is reasonably assured. The company generates services revenue from availability services, processing services, software maintenance and rentals, professional services and broker/dealer fees. Services revenue is recorded as the services are provided F-8 Table of Contents based on the fair value of each element which is based on the sales price of each element when sold separately. Most AS services revenue consists of fixed monthly fees based upon the specific computer configuration or business process for which the service is being provided, and the related costs are incurred ratably over the contract period. When recovering from an interruption, customers generally are contractually obligated to pay additional fees, which typically cover the incremental costs of supporting customers during recoveries. FS services revenue includes monthly fees, which may include a fixed minimum fee and/or variable fees based on a measure of volume or activity, such as the number of accounts, trades or transactions, users or the number of hours of service. For fixed-fee professional services contracts, services revenue is recorded based upon the estimated percentage of completion, measured by the actual number of hours incurred divided by the total estimated number of hours for the project. When contracts include both professional services and software and there are significant program modifications or customization, installation, systems integration or related services, the professional services and license revenue is combined and recorded based upon the estimated percentage of completion, measured in the manner described above. Changes in the estimated costs or hours to complete the contract and losses, if any, are reflected in the period during which the change or loss becomes known. License fees result from contracts that permit the customer to use a SunGard software product at the customers site. Generally, these contracts are multiple-element arrangements since they usually provide for professional services and ongoing software maintenance. In these instances, license fees are recognized upon the signing of the contract and delivery of the software if the license fee is known, collection is probable, and there is sufficient evidence of the fair value of each undelivered element. Revenue is recorded when billed when customer payments are extended beyond normal billing terms, or at acceptance when there is significant acceptance, technology or service risk. Revenue also is recorded over the contract period in those instances where the software is bundled together with computer equipment or other post-delivery services, and there is not sufficient evidence of the fair value of each element. Sufficient evidence of fair value is determined by reference to applicable accounting standards and is defined as vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE). If there is no VSOE of the fair value of the delivered element (which is usually the software) but there is VSOE of the fair value of each of the undelivered elements (which are usually maintenance and professional services), then the residual method is used to determine the revenue for the delivered element. The revenue for each of the undelivered elements is set at the fair value of those elements using VSOE of the price paid when each of the undelivered elements is sold separately. The revenue remaining after allocation to the undelivered elements (i.e., the residual) is allocated to the delivered element. VSOE supporting the fair value of maintenance is based on the optional renewal rates for each product and is typically 18% to 20% of the software license fee per year. VSOE supporting the fair value of professional services is based on the standard daily rates charged when those services are sold separately. In some multiple-element arrangements that include software licenses and services, the services rates are discounted. In these cases, a portion of the software license fee is deferred and recognized as the services are performed based on VSOE of the services. Unbilled receivables are created when services are performed or software is delivered and revenue is recognized in advance of billings. Deferred revenue is created when billing occurs in advance of performing certain services. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of investments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less. F-9 Table of Contents Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. The company sells a significant portion of its products and services to the financial services industry and could be affected by the overall condition of that industry. The company believes that any credit risk associated with accounts receivable is substantially mitigated by the relatively large number of customer accounts and reasonably short collection terms. Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value, which approximates fair value. By policy, the company places its available cash and short-term investments with institutions of high credit-quality and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of each of the companys foreign operations is generally the local currency of the country in which the operation is located. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Increases and decreases in net assets resulting from foreign currency translation are reflected in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (three to eight years for equipment and ten to 40 years for buildings and improvements). Leasehold improvements are amortized ratably over their remaining lease term or useful life, if shorter. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment was $122 million for the period January 1, 2005 through August 10, 2005, $82 million for the period August 11, 2005 through December 31, 2005, $212 million in 2006 and $219 million in 2007. Software Products Product development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of design and development costs of new products and significant enhancements to existing products incurred before the establishment of technological feasibility. Costs associated with purchased software, software obtained through business acquisitions, and new products and enhancements to existing products that are technologically feasible and recoverable are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related products, generally two to eleven years (average life is seven years), using the straight-line method or the ratio of current revenue to current and anticipated revenue from such software, whichever provides the greater amortization. Amortization of all software products aggregated $56 million for the period January 1, 2005 through August 10, 2005, $81 million for the period August 11, 2005 through December 31, 2005, $223 million in 2006 and $246 million in 2007. Capitalized development costs were $9 million for the period from January 1, 2005 through August 10, 2005, $6 million for the period from August 11, 2005 through December 31, 2005, $21 million in 2006 and $26 million in 2007. Customer Base Intangible Assets Customer base intangible assets represent customer contracts and relationships obtained as part of acquired businesses and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from three to 25 years (average life is 15 years). Other Tangible and Intangible Assets Other tangible and intangible assets consist primarily of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with debt issued in the Transaction, noncompetition agreements obtained in business acquisitions, long-term accounts F-10 Table of Contents receivable, prepayments and long-term investments. Deferred financing costs are amortized over the term of the related debt. Noncompetition agreements are amortized using the straight-line method over their stated terms, ranging from two to five years. Future Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets Based on amounts recorded at December 31, 2007, total expected amortization of all acquisition-related intangible assets in each of the years ended December 31 follows (in millions): 2008 $ 430 2009 424 2010 412 2011 385 2012 338 Trade Name and Goodwill The trade name intangible asset primarily represents the fair value of the SunGard trade name at August 11, 2005, is an indefinite-lived asset, and, therefore, is not subject to amortization, but is reviewed at least annually for impairment. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. At least annually, the company compares the carrying value of its reporting units to their estimated fair value. If the carrying value is greater than the respective estimated fair value, the company then determines if the goodwill is impaired and whether some or all of the goodwill should be written off as a charge to operations. The estimate of fair value requires various assumptions including the use of projections of future cash flows and discount rates that reflect the risks associated with achieving the future cash flows. Changes in the underlying business could affect these estimates, which in turn could affect the fair value of the reporting unit. The following table summarizes changes in goodwill by segment (in millions): FS HE PS AS Total Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 3,104 $ 1,168 $ 626 $ 2,006 $ 6,904 Adjustments related to the Transaction (293 ) (192 ) 267 102 (116 ) 2006 acquisitions 96    96 2006 divestitures (7 )    (7 ) Effect of foreign currency translation 18  11 45 74 Balance at December 31, 2006 2,918 976 904 2,153 6,951 2007 acquisitions 47  12 129 188 Adjustments related to the Transaction and prior year acquisitions (33 ) (5 ) (6 ) (28 ) (72 ) Effect of foreign currency translation 10  1 8 19 Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 2,942 $ 971 $ 911 $ 2,262 $ 7,086 Stock Compensation Successor Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) Number 123R (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), superseded Accounting Principles Board Opinion Number 25 (APB 25) and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options. The company adopted SFAS 123R as of the date of the Transaction using the modified prospective method, which requires companies to record stock F-11 Table of Contents compensation expense over the remaining service period for all unvested awards as of the adoption date. Using the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, stock compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award using the Black-Scholes pricing model which is recognized as expense over the appropriate service period. Predecessor Prior to the closing of the Transaction, the company applied APB 25 in accounting for its stock option and award plans. Accordingly, the company recorded compensation expense for its restricted stock awards, and the company included in merger costs a non-cash stock compensation charge of approximately $59 million in the period from January 1, 2005 to August 10, 2005 due to the accelerated vesting of all options and restricted stock in connection with the Transaction (see Note 2). SFAS Number 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123), as amended by SFAS Number 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean Amendment of FASB Statement 123, changed the method for recognition of cost of stock option and award plans. Had the company adopted the optional cost recognition requirements of SFAS 123, net income would have been reduced by $135 million in the period from January 1 through August 10, 2005. Income Taxes The company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are calculated based on the difference between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the currently enacted income tax rates in effect during the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on other topics related to accounting for income tax assets and liabilities, interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income taxes in interim periods as well as income tax disclosures. FIN 48 was effective as of January 1, 2007. FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS 157 is effective as of January 1, 2008. In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Positions No. 157-1 and No. 157-2 which partially defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities and remove certain leasing transactions from its scope. The company is currently evaluating the impacts and disclosures of this standard, but would not expect SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, (SFAS 158), Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). Under SFAS 158, companies must recognize a net liability or asset to report the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans (OPEB plans) on their balance sheets. SFAS 158 also requires certain additional annual disclosures related to pension and OPEB plans. SFAS 158 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. F-12 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, (SFAS 141R), which changes accounting principles for business acquisitions. SFAS No. 141R requires the recognition of all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction based on the acquisition-date fair value. Certain provisions of this standard will, among other things, impact the determination of consideration paid or payable in a business combination and change accounting practices for transaction costs, acquired contingencies, acquisition-related restructuring costs, in-process research and development, indemnification assets, and tax benefits. SFAS No. 141R is effective for business combinations and adjustments to all acquisition-related deferred tax asset and liability balances occurring after December 31, 2008. The company is currently evaluating the requirements of this standard; however, this standard could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). The objective of SFAS 160 is to improve the relevance, comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective January 1, 2009. The company has not yet determined the impact of adopting SFAS 160 on the consolidated financial statements. 2. Acquisitions Acquisitions by the company The company seeks to acquire businesses that broaden its existing product lines and service offerings by adding complementary products and service offerings and by expanding its geographic reach. During 2007, the company completed nine acquisitions in its FS segment and one in each of its AS and PS segments. Cash paid, subject to certain adjustments, was $265 million. The following table lists the businesses the company acquired in 2007: Acquired Company/Business Date Acquired Description XRT SAs High-End Treasury Business 01/25/2007 Treasury and cash management applications.

F-13 Table of Contents At December 31, 2007, the purchase price allocations for businesses acquired in 2007 are preliminary and subject to finalization of appraisals of acquired software and customer base assets and deferred income taxes. In February 2008, the company completed 2 acquisitions in its FS segment for aggregate cash paid of approximately $84 million. During 2006, the company completed ten acquisitions in its FS segment, and, in 2005, the company completed eight acquisitions in its FS segment, two acquisitions in its PS segment and one acquisition in its AS segment. At December 31, 2007, contingent purchase price obligations that depend upon the operating performance of five acquired businesses total $106 million, approximately $1 million of which the company currently expects to pay in the next year. The amount paid, if any, will generally be recorded as additional goodwill at the time the actual performance is known and the amounts become due. There were no amounts earned or paid in 2005, 2006 or 2007, and there were no amounts payable as of December 31, 2007. Acquisition of SunGard As discussed in Note 1, the Transaction was completed on August 11, 2005 and was financed by a combination of borrowings under the companys senior secured credit facilities, the issuance of senior notes and senior subordinated notes, the funding under the companys accounts receivable securitization program, and the equity investment of the Sponsors, co-investors and management. See Note 5 for a description of the companys debt. The purchase price including transaction costs was approximately $11.73 billion. The total purchase price was allocated to the companys net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of August 11, 2005 as set forth below (in millions). The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Property and equipment $ 701 Software products 1,507 Customer base 3,038 Trade name 1,019 Goodwill 6,682 Other tangible and intangible assets 265 Deferred income taxes (1,855 ) Debt assumed (464 ) Net current assets acquired 838 Total purchase price 11,731 Non-cash equity contribution 154 Cash used in acquisition of SunGard by Solar Capital $ 11,577 Pro forma financial information (unaudited) The following unaudited pro forma results of operations (in millions) for 2006 and 2007 assume that businesses acquired in 2006 and 2007 occurred as of the beginning of 2006 and were reflected in the companys results from that date. The pro forma results for 2007 include the businesses listed in the table above. For 2006, in addition to the businesses listed in the table above, the pro forma results include the 2006 acquisitions, the more significant of which are System Access Limited, Shanghai Fudan Kingstar Computer Co., Ltd. and Integrated Business Systems, Inc. This unaudited pro forma information should not be relied upon as necessarily being indicative of the historical results that would have been obtained if the acquisitions had actually occurred at the beginning of each period presented, nor of the results that may be obtained in the future. The pro forma adjustments include the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, interest expense and related tax effects.

The amounts outstanding under the term loan facility denominated in euros and pounds sterling were $191 million and $163 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. In February 2007 the senior secured credit facility was amended to reduce the effective interest rates on the term loan facility, increase the size of that facility from $4.0 billion to $4.4 billion, extend the maturity by one year and change certain other terms. The company used the additional borrowings to redeem $400 million of senior floating rate notes that were due 2013. The related redemption premium of $19 million and write-off of approximately $9 million of deferred financing costs were included in other expense. F-16 Table of Contents (A) Senior Secured Credit Facilities Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at the companys option, either (a) a base rate that is the higher of (1) the prime rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and (2) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1% or (b) LIBOR based on the costs of funds for deposits in the currency of such borrowing for either 30, 60, 90 or 180 days. The applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be reduced subject to attaining certain leverage ratios. As of December 31, 2007, we have achieved the leverage ratio necessary to reduce the applicable margin by 0.25% per annum, which will be effective for borrowings under these facilities in March 2008. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the senior secured credit facilities, the company pays a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate is 0.50% per annum and may be reduced subject to attaining certain leverage ratios. All obligations under the senior secured credit agreement are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by SunGard Holdco LLC and by substantially all domestic, 100% wholly owned subsidiaries, referred to, collectively, as U.S. Guarantors. The company is required to repay installments on the loans under the term loan facilities in quarterly principal amounts of 0.25% of their funded total principal amount through March 2013, with the remaining amount payable in May 2013, provided, however, that such date will automatically become February 2014 if all the senior notes are extended, renewed or refinanced on or prior to May 15, 2013. The senior secured credit facilities also require the company to pay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with excess cash flow and proceeds from certain asset sales, casualty and condemnation events, other borrowings and certain financings under the companys accounts receivable securitization program. Any required payments would be applied pro rata to the term loan lenders and to installments of the term loan facilities in direct order of maturity. Principal amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due and payable in full at maturity in August 2011. The senior secured credit facilities contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the companys (and most or all of its subsidiaries) ability to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock, pay dividends and distributions on or repurchase capital stock, create liens on assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, repay subordinated indebtedness, make investments, loans or advances, make capital expenditures, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, amend certain material agreements, change its lines of business, sell assets and engage in mergers or consolidations. In addition, under the senior secured credit facilities, the company is required to satisfy certain total leverage and interest coverage ratios. The company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage the amount of its floating rate debt in order to reduce its exposure to variable rate interest payments associated with the senior secured credit facilities. The company pays the counterparty a stream of fixed interest payments for the term of the swap, and in turn, receives variable interest payments based on LIBOR (4.90% at December 31, 2007) from the counterparties. The net receipt or payment from the interest rate swap agreements is included in interest expense. A summary of the companys interest rate swaps follows: Inception Maturity Notional Amount (in millions) Interest rate paid Interest rate received November 2005 February 2009 $ 800 4.85 % LIBOR February 2006 February 2011 800 5.00 % LIBOR January 2008 February 2011 750 3.17 % LIBOR February 2008 February 2010 750 2.71 % LIBOR Total/Weighted average interest rate $ 3,100 3.96 % F-17 Table of Contents The interest rate swaps are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and included at estimated fair value as an asset or a liability in the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair value of the swaps was based on current settlement prices and quoted market prices of comparable contracts. For the period from August 11 through December 31, 2005 and for 2006 and 2007, the company included an unrealized after-tax loss of $1.5 million, an unrealized after-tax gain of $3.3 million and an unrealized after-tax loss of $22.8 million, respectively, in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) related to the change in market value on the swaps. The market value of the swaps recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) may be recognized in the statement of operations if certain terms of the senior secured credit facilities change, or if the loan is extinguished. The $35 million fair value of the swap agreements, which represents the estimated amount the company would have to pay to terminate the agreements at December 31, 2007, is included in accrued expenses. The effects of the November 2005 swap and the February 2006 swap are reflected in the effective interest rate for the senior secured credit facilities in the table above. (B) Senior Notes due 2009 and 2014 On January 15, 2004, the company issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes, of which $250 million are 3.75% notes due 2009 and $250 million are 4.875% notes due 2014 (Senior Notes due 2009 and 2014), which are subject to certain standard covenants. As a result of the Transaction, the Senior Notes due 2009 and 2014 became collateralized on an equal and ratable basis with loans under the senior secured credit facilities and are guaranteed by all subsidiaries that guarantee the senior notes due 2013 and senior subordinated notes due 2015. The Senior Notes due 2009 and 2014 are recorded at $460 million and $470 as of December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively, reflecting the remaining unamortized discount caused by the Transaction. The $30 million discount at December 31, 2007 will be amortized and included in interest expense over the remaining periods to maturity. (C) Senior Notes due 2013 and Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 The senior notes due 2013 (the senior notes) are senior unsecured obligations that rank senior in right of payment to future debt and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the senior notes, including the senior subordinated notes. The senior notes (i) rank equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt and other obligations that are not, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the senior notes, (ii) are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt, and (iii) are structurally subordinated to all obligations of each subsidiary that is not a guarantor of the senior notes. All obligations under the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all domestic, 100% wholly owned subsidiaries of the company. The senior subordinated notes due 2015 (the senior subordinated notes) are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that are subordinated in right of payment to the existing and future senior debt, including the senior secured credit facilities, the Senior Notes due 2009 and 2014 and the senior notes. The senior subordinated notes (i) rank equally in right of payment to all future senior subordinated debt, (ii) are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt, (iii) are structurally subordinated to all obligations of each subsidiary that is not a guarantor of the senior subordinated notes, and (iv) rank senior in right of payment to all future debt and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the senior subordinated notes. The senior notes and senior subordinated notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of the company, at any time at varying redemption prices that generally include premiums, which are defined in the applicable indentures. In addition, upon a change of control, the company is required to make an offer to redeem all of the senior notes and senior subordinated notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. F-18 Table of Contents The indentures governing the senior notes and senior subordinated notes contain a number of covenants that restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the companys ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares, pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of its capital stock or make other restricted payments, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, create liens securing certain debt without securing the senior notes or senior subordinated notes, as applicable, sell certain assets, consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets and designate its subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. (D) Off Balance Sheet DebtAccounts Receivable Securitization Program Under the accounts receivable facility, eligible receivables are sold to third-party conduits through a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity that is not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The company services the receivables and charges a monthly fee at market rates. The third-party conduits are sponsored by certain lenders under the companys senior secured credit facilities. Additional subsidiaries may become parties to the facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions including the completion of satisfactory due diligence. Sales of receivables under the facility qualify as sales under the provisions of SFAS No. 140 Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities (SFAS 140). Accordingly, these receivables, totaling $655 million and $682 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively, net of applicable allowances, and the corresponding borrowings, totaling $376 million and $441 million at December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively, are excluded from the companys consolidated balance sheets. The companys retained interest in receivables sold as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 is $275 million and $243 million, respectively. The loss on sale of receivables and discount on retained interests are included in other income (expense) and totaled $19 million for the period ended December 31, 2005 and $29 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007. The gain or loss on sale of receivables is determined at the date of transfer based upon the fair value of the assets sold and the interests retained. The company estimates fair value based on the present value of expected cash flows. The collection period and discount rate (prime rate of 8.25% and 7.25% at December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively) are the key assumptions used in this estimate. At December 31, 2007, a 20% adverse change in the assumed collection period or assumed discount rate would not have a material impact on the companys financial position or results of operations. Future Maturities At December 31, 2007, annual maturities of long-term debt during the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in millions): 2008 $ 55 2009 (1) 316 2010 48 2011 76 2012 46 Thereafter (1) 6,974 (1) 2009 and Thereafter include debt discounts of $6 million and $24 million, respectively. F-19 Table of Contents Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following table presents the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments as of the end of the last two years (in millions): December 31, 2006 December 31, 2007 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Interest rate swap contracts $ 3 $ 3 $ (35 ) $ (35 ) Floating rate debt 4,368 4,426 4,374 4,228 Fixed rate debt 3,071 3,212 3,111 3,142 The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, to the extent the underlying liability will be settled in cash, approximate carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value, which represents the estimated amount the company would have to pay to terminate the agreements at December 31, 2007. The carrying value of the companys floating rate long-term debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the companys fixed rate long-term debt is based on quoted market rates. 6. Stock Option and Award Plans and Stock-Based Compensation Successor To provide long-term equity incentives following the Transaction, the SunGard 2005 Management Incentive Plan (Plan) was established. The Plan authorizes the issuance of equity subject to awards made under the Plan for up to 60 million shares of Class A common stock and 7 million shares of Class L common stock of SunGard Capital Corp. and 2.5 million shares of preferred stock of SunGard Capital Corp. II. Under the Plan, awards of time-based and performance-based options have been granted to purchase Units in the Parent Companies. Each Unit consists of 1.3 shares of Class A common stock and 0.1444 shares of Class L common stock of SunGard Capital Corp. and 0.05 shares of preferred stock of SunGard Capital Corp. II. The shares comprising a Unit are in the same proportion as the shares issued to all stockholders of the Parent Companies. The options are exercisable only for whole Units and cannot be separately exercised for the individual classes of stock. Beginning in 2007, hybrid equity awards generally were granted under the Plan, which awards are composed of restricted stock units (RSUs) for Units in the Parent Companies and options to purchase Class A common stock in SunGard Capital Corp. All awards under the Plan are granted at fair market value on the date of grant. Time-based options vest over five years as follows: 25% one year after date of grant, and 1/48th of the remaining balance each month thereafter for 48 months. Time-based RSUs vest over five years as follows: 10% one year after date of grant, and 1/48th of the remaining balance each month thereafter for 48 months. Performance-based options and RSUs vest upon the attainment of certain annual or cumulative earnings goals based on Internal EBITA (defined as income from operations before amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock compensation expense and certain other items) targets for the company during a specified performance period, generally five or six years. Time-based and performance-based options can partly or fully vest upon a change of control and certain other termination events, subject to certain conditions, and expire ten years from the date of grant. Once vested, time-based and performance-based RSUs become payable in shares upon the first to occur of a change of control, separation from service without cause, or the date that is five years after the date of grant. Options to purchase shares of the Predecessor held by certain members of management that were not exercised before closing of the Transaction were automatically converted into fully-vested continuation options to purchase 7.4 million Units having the same aggregate intrinsic value of $100 million. The continuation options have an exercise price of $4.50. F-20 Table of Contents The total fair value of options that vested for the period from August 11, 2005 through December 31, 2005 and for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 was $17 million, $50 million and $31 million, respectively. The total fair value of RSUs that vested for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $0.7 million. As of the date of the Transaction, the company adopted SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective method, which requires companies to record stock compensation expense over the remaining service period for all unvested awards as of the adoption date. The fair value of option Units granted in each year using the Black-Scholes pricing model and related assumptions follow: August 11 through December 31, 2005 Year ended December 31, 2006 Year ended December 31, 2007 Weighted-average fair value on date of grant $ 10.56 $ 9.99 $ 11.47 Assumptions used to calculate fair value: Volatility 62% 62% 60% Risk-free interest rate 4.2% 4.8% 4.6% Expected term 5.5 years 4.8 years 5.0 years Dividends zero zero zero The fair value of options on Class A shares granted in 2007 using the Black-Scholes pricing model and related assumptions follow: Year ended December 31, 2007 Weighted-average fair value on date of grant $ 1.49 Assumptions used to calculate fair value: Volatility 79% Risk-free interest rate 4.1% Expected term 5.0 years Dividends zero The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Since the company is not publicly traded, the company utilizes equity valuations performed by an external valuation firm based on (a) stock market valuations of public companies in comparable businesses, (b) recent transactions involving comparable companies and (c) any other factors deemed relevant. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from market comparisons of certain publicly traded companies and other factors. The expected term of stock options granted is derived from historical experience and expectations and represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding. The requisite service period is generally five or six years from the date of grant. For the period August 11, 2005 through December 31, 2005 and for 2006 and 2007, the company included non-cash stock compensation expense of $29 million, $38 million and $32 million, respectively, in sales, marketing and administration expenses with a corresponding increase in capital in excess of par value. At December 31, 2007, there is approximately $61 million and $8 million, respectively, of unearned non-cash stock-based compensation related to time-based options and RSUs that the company expects to record as expense primarily over the next three years. In addition, at December 31, 2007, there is approximately $136 million and $13 million, respectively, of unearned non-cash stock-based compensation related to performance-based options and RSUs that the company could record as expense primarily over the next three years, depending on the level F-21 Table of Contents of achievement of financial performance goals. For time-based options and RSUs, compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of five years. For performance-based options and RSUs, recognition of compensation expense starts when the achievement of financial performance goals becomes probable and is recorded over the remaining service period . The following table summarizes option/RSU activity: Units Class A Common Stock Options (in millions) Weighted- Average Price RSUs (in millions) Weighted- Average Price Options (in millions) Weighted- Average Price Continuation options 7.4 $ 4.50 Granted 30.7 18.00 Canceled (1.6 ) 14.52 Outstanding at December 31, 2005 36.5 15.40 Granted 2.6 18.00 Canceled (1.4 ) 18.00 Exercised (0.3 ) 4.58 Outstanding at December 31, 2006 37.4 15.57 Granted 1.7 20.72 1.1 $ 21.14 2.7 $ 2.26 Canceled (1.4 ) 6.25   Exercised (2.5 ) 18.08   Outstanding at December 31, 2007 35.2 16.03 1.1 21.14 2.7 2.26 At December 31, 2007, approximately 32,000 RSU Units were vested. Shares available for grant under the 2005 plan at December 31, 2007 were 7.9 million shares of Class A common stock and 1.5 million shares of Class L common stock of SunGard Capital Corp. and 0.6 million shares of preferred stock of SunGard Capital Corp II, which combined could be used to issue 6.1 million Units. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 was $4 million and $20 million, respectively. Cash proceeds received on behalf of the Parent Companies related to exercises of stock options are generally used to fund repurchases of stock of the Parent Companies from terminated employees. The following table summarizes information as of December 31, 2007 concerning options for Units and Class A shares that have vested and that are expected to vest in the future: Vested and Expected to Vest Exercisable Exercise Price Number of Options Outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average Remaining Life (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Number of Options (in millions) Weighted-average Remaining Life (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Units $ 4.50 5.5 5.2 $ 99 5.5 5.2 $ 99 18.00 16.5 7.7 75 8.5 7.7 39 20.72 1.1 9.2 2  9.3  Class A Shares 2.22 1.2 9.7  0.1 9.7  2.38 0.4 10.0   10.0  F-22 Table of Contents Predecessor Prior to the Transaction, the company had other equity incentive plans, whereby restricted shares or options to purchase shares of common stock were granted to key employees and outside directors. During 2005, the company awarded performance accelerated stock options (PASOs) for an aggregate of 4.3 million shares. All outstanding options and restricted shares as of August 10, 2005 were accelerated in connection with the Transaction (see Merger costs in Note 2).

Savings Plans The company and its subsidiaries maintain savings plans that cover substantially all employees. These plans generally provide that employee contributions are matched with cash contributions by the company subject to certain limitations including a limitation on the companys contributions to 4% of the employees compensation. Total expense under these plans aggregated $23 million for the period from January 1, 2005 through August 10, 2005, $16 million for the period from August 11, 2005 through December 31, 2005, $49 million in 2006 and $53 million in 2007. 8.

The U.S. tax loss carry-forwards include federal of $233 million and state of $670 million, respectively. Israeli tax loss carry-forwards, totaling $20 million, are unlimited in duration and are linked to the Israeli consumer price index. European and Asian tax loss carry-forwards total $106 million. The tax loss carry-forwards expire between 2008 and 2027 and utilization is limited in certain jurisdictions. The company recorded the benefit of tax loss carry-forwards of $1 million, $58 million and $2 million in the Predecessor period of 2005 and in 2006 and 2007, respectively. There was no benefit of tax loss carry-forwards recorded in the Successor period of 2005. Predecessor net operating loss carry-forwards as of December 31, 2007 were $185 million. Utilization, if any, of Predecessor net operating loss carry-forwards not recorded as an asset at August 10, 2005 will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill. The company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48) on January 1, 2007 with no material effect. At January 1, 2007 the companys tax reserve was $28 million. During 2007, the tax reserve was reduced by $7 million for settled audits, reduced by $2 million related to a reduction in prior year tax positions and increased by $1 million for incremental interest. The companys reserve for unrecognized income tax benefits at December 31, 2007 is $20 million. This liability includes approximately $3 million (net of federal and state benefit) in accrued interest and penalties. Since substantially all of the liability relates to matters existing at the date of the Transaction, any reversal of reserve is not expected to have a material impact on the companys annual effective tax rate. The company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar years 2003 through 2006 and various state and foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination as well. At any time some portion of the companys operations are under audit. Accordingly, certain matters may be resolved within the next 12 months which could result in a change in the liability. As of December 31, 2007, the company has not accrued deferred U.S. income taxes on $264 million of unremitted earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries as such earnings are expected to be reinvested overseas and used for U.K. debt service. If all of these earnings were to be repatriated at one time, the residual U.S. tax is estimated to be $39 million. 9. Segment Information The company has four reportable segments: FS, HE and PS, which together form the companys Software & Processing Solutions business, and AS. FS primarily serves financial services institutions through a broad range of complementary software solutions that process their investment and trading transactions. The principal purpose of most of these systems is to automate the many detailed processes associated with trading securities, managing investment portfolios and accounting for investment assets. HE primarily provides software, strategic and systems integration consulting, and technology management services to colleges and universities. PS primarily provides software and processing solutions designed to meet the specialized needs of local, state, federal and central governments, public safety and justice agencies, public schools, utilities, non-profits, and other public sector institutions. AS helps its customers maintain access to the information and computer systems they need to run their businesses by providing them with cost-effective resources to keep their IT systems reliable and secure. AS offers a complete range of availability services from always ready standby solutions to always on production services.

Related Party Transactions In connection with the Transaction, SunGard Holdco LLC, the companys parent, paid the Sponsors $96 million in fees and expenses for financial and structural advice and analysis as well as assistance with due diligence investigations and debt financing negotiations. This amount has been allocated as debt issuance costs or included in the overall purchase price of the Transaction. The company is required to pay management fees to affiliates of the Sponsors in connection with management consulting services provided to the company and the Parent Companies. These services include financial, managerial and operational advice and implementation of strategies for improving the operating, marketing and financial performance of the company and its subsidiaries. The management fees are equal to 1% of quarterly Adjusted EBITDA, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments as defined in the management agreement, and are payable quarterly in arrears. During the period August 11, 2005 through December 31, 2005 and for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, the company recorded $6 million, $14 million and $17 million, respectively, relating to management fees in sales, marketing and administration expenses in the statement of operations, of which $3 million and $4 million, respectively, is included in other accrued expenses on the balance sheet at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007, respectively. In addition, these affiliates of the Sponsors may be entitled to additional fees in connection with certain financing, acquisition, disposition and change of control transactions. In connection with the Transaction, SunGard Capital Corp. received a $16 million promissory note from the companys chief executive officer (CEO) in payment for 1.6 million shares of Class A common stock and 0.2 million shares of Class L common stock, and SunGard Capital Corp. II received a $6 million promissory note (together with the SunGard Capital Corp. note, the Notes) from the CEO in payment for 61 thousand shares of preferred stock. In 2007, these Notes were fully repaid and cancelled. The Notes bore interest at a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.5% divided by 0.84725% per annum and were payable on the last day of each calendar quarter in arrears. SunGard Data Systems Inc. was not a party to these arrangements, which were entered into prior to the consummation of the Transaction, therefore no amounts relating to the Notes were ever recorded in the companys financial statements. 11. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees The company leases a substantial portion of its computer equipment and facilities under operating leases. The companys leases are generally non-cancelable or cancelable only upon payment of cancellation fees. All lease payments are based on the passage of time, but include, in some cases, payments for insurance, maintenance and property taxes. There are no bargain purchase options on operating leases at favorable terms, but most facility leases have one or more renewal options and have either fixed or Consumer Price Index escalation clauses. Certain facility leases include an annual escalation for increases in utilities and property taxes. In addition, certain facility leases are subject to restoration clauses, whereby the facility may need to be restored to its original condition upon termination of the lease. There were $25 million of restoration liabilities included in accrued expenses at December 31, 2007. Future minimum rentals under operating leases with initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2007 follow (in millions): 2008 $ 184 2009 140 2010 116 2011 88 2012 75 Thereafter 215 $ 818 F-29 Table of Contents Rent expense aggregated $114 million for the period January 1, 2005 through August 10, 2005, $75 million for the period August 11, 2005 through December 31, 2005, $184 million in 2006 and $208 million in 2007. At December 31, 2007, the company had outstanding letters of credit and bid bonds of $43 million, issued primarily as security for performance under certain customer contracts. In connection with certain previously acquired businesses, up to $106 million could be paid as additional consideration depending on the future operating results of those businesses (see Note 2). In the event that the management agreement described in Note 10 is terminated by the Sponsors (or their affiliates) or the company and its Parent Companies, the Sponsors (or their affiliates) will receive a lump sum payment equal to the present value of the annual management fees that would have been payable for the remainder of the term of the management agreement. The initial term of the management agreement is ten years, and it extends annually for one year unless the Sponsors (or their affiliates) or the company and its Parent Companies provide notice to the other. The company is presently a party to certain lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management, none of its current legal proceedings will be material to the companys business or financial results. The companys customer contracts generally include typical indemnification of customers, primarily for intellectual property infringement claims. Liabilities in connection with such obligations have not been material. 12.

Supplemental Guarantor Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements On August 11, 2005, in connection with the Transaction, the company issued $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior notes and the outstanding senior subordinated notes as described in Note 5. The senior notes are jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis and the senior subordinated notes are jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured senior subordinated basis, in each case, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of the company (Guarantors). Each of the Guarantors is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by the company. None of the other subsidiaries of the company, either direct or indirect, guarantee the senior notes and senior subordinated notes (Non-Guarantors). The Guarantors also unconditionally guarantee the senior secured credit facilities, described in Note 5.

(j) SunGard Expert Solutions LLC is a Utah Limited Liability Company. Sections 1801 through 1809 of the Utah Revised Limited Liability Company Act (the URLLCA), subject to the limitations and procedures contained therein, provide for mandatory and discretionary indemnification of a limited liability companys managers, members and other personnel, and related matters. II-5 Table of Contents Section 1802 of the URLLCA provides that a company may indemnify an individual made a party to a proceeding because the individual is or was a manager of a company, against liability incurred in the proceeding if: (i) the conduct of the individual was in good faith; (ii) the individual reasonably believed that the individuals conduct was in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the company; and (iii) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the individual had no reasonable cause to believe the individuals conduct was unlawful. Section 1802 of the URLLCA further provides, however, that the company may not indemnify a manager thereunder: (i) in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the company in which the manager was adjudged liable to the company; or (ii) in connection with any other proceeding charging improper personal benefit to the manager, whether or not in the individuals official capacity, in which the individual was adjudged liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received by the manager. Section 1803 of the URLLCA provides that, unless limited by its articles of organization, a company shall indemnify a manager who was successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding, or in the defense of any claim, issue, or matter in the proceeding, to which the manager was a party because of being a manager of the company, against reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by the manager in connection with the proceeding or claim to which the individual has been successful. Section 1807 of the URLLCA provides that, unless a companys articles of organization provide otherwise, to the same extent as a manager, (i) a member of the company is entitled to mandatory indemnification under Section 1803 thereof and is entitled to apply for court-ordered indemnification under Section 1805 thereof; and (ii) that the company may indemnify and advance expenses to a member, employee, fiduciary or agent of the company to the same extent as a manager.

(k) Cooperative Research Services, Inc. is incorporated under the laws of Vermont. Section 8.51 of the Vermont Business Corporation Act (the VBCA) permits a corporation to indemnify an individual who is or was a director against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by the individual in connection with any proceeding to which the individual may be made a party by reason of the individuals service in that capacity if: (i) the director conducted himself or herself in good faith, (ii) the director reasonably believed that his or her conduct, in an official capacity with the corporation, was in the best interests of the corporation and, in all other cases, the conduct was at least not opposed to its best interests, and (iii) in a proceeding brought by a governmental entity, the director had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, and the director is not finally found to have engaged in a reckless or intentional unlawful act. The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendre is not, of itself, determinative that the director did not meet the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a corporation may not indemnify a director if the director was adjudged liable to the corporation in a proceeding by or in the right of a corporation, or on the basis that a personal benefit was improperly received by the director in a proceeding charging improper personal benefit to the director. In addition, Section 8.52 of the VBCA provides that, unless limited in a corporations charter, a corporation shall indemnify its directors who are wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which the directors are parties by reason of their service in those capacities against reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding.

(a) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: (1) to file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act; (ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendments thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more that a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; (2) that, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof; and (3) to remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. II-17 Table of Contents (4) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. (b) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to respond to requests for information that may be incorporated by reference into the prospectus pursuant to Item 11A or 12 of Form S-1, within one business day of receipt of such request, and to send the incorporated documents by first class mail or equally prompt means. This includes information contained in documents filed subsequent to the effective date of the registration statement through the date of responding to the request. (c) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to supply by means of a post-effective amendment all information concerning a transaction, and the company being acquired involved therein, that was not the subject of and included in the registration statement when it became effective. (d) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
