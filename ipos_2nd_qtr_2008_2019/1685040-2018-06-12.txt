This summary may not contain all of the information that may be important to you. To better understand our business and financial position, you should carefully review this entire prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference herein. Our Company We are a major provider of annuity products and life insurance in the United States through multiple independent distribution channels and marketing arrangements with a diverse network of distribution partners. Our in-force book of products consists of approximately 2.6 million insurance policies and annuity contracts at March 31, 2018, which are organized into three reporting segments: (i) Annuities, which includes variable, fixed, index-linked and income annuities; (ii) Life, which includes variable, term, universal and whole life policies; and (iii) Run-off, which consists of operations related to products which we are not actively selling and which are separately managed. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations not included in the segments in Corporate & Other. At March 31, 2018, we had $219.0 billion of total assets with total stockholders equity of $13.6 billion, including accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI); approximately $622.0 billion of life insurance face amount in-force ($428.0 billion, net of reinsurance) and $146.7 billion of annuity assets under management (AUM), which we define as our general account investments and our separate account assets. At March 31, 2018, we had total AUM of approximately $195.0 billion. Prior to the Distribution, the companies that became our subsidiaries were wholly owned by MetLife. Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, BLIC), which is our largest operating subsidiary, was formed in November 2014 through the merger of three affiliated life insurance companies and a former offshore, internal reinsurance subsidiary that mainly reinsured guarantees associated with variable annuity products issued by MetLife affiliates. The principal purpose of the merger was to provide increased transparency relative to capital allocation and variable annuity risk management. In order to further our capabilities to market and distribute our products, prior to the Distribution, MetLife contributed to us (i) several entities including Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, New England Life Insurance Company (NELICO) and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY; (ii) a licensed broker-dealer; (iii) a licensed investment advisor; and (iv) other entities necessary for the execution of our strategy. We seek to be a financially disciplined and, over time, cost-competitive product manufacturer with an emphasis on independent distribution. We aim to leverage our large block of in-force life insurance policies and annuity contracts to operate more efficiently. We believe that our strategy of offering a targeted set of products to serve our customers and distribution partners, each of which is intended to produce positive statutory distributable cash flows on an accelerated basis compared to our legacy products, will enhance our ability to invest in our business and distribute cash to our shareholders over time. We also believe that our product strategy of offering a more tailored set of new products and our agreement to outsource a significant portion of our client administration and service processes, is consistent with our focus on reducing our expense structure over time. S-1 Table of Contents Risk management of both our in-force book and our new business to enhance sustained, long-term shareholder value is fundamental to our strategy. Consequently, in writing new business we prioritize the value of the new business we write over sales volumes. We assess the value of new products by taking into account the amount and timing of cash flows, the use and cost of capital required to support our financial strength ratings and the cost of risk mitigation. We remain focused on maintaining our strong capital base and we have established a risk management approach that seeks to mitigate the effects of severe market disruptions and other economic events on our business. See Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Business  Our variable annuity exposure management strategy may not be effective, may result in net income volatility and may negatively affect our statutory capital, Business  Segments and Corporate & Other  Annuities and Business  Risk Management Strategies  ULSG Market Risk Exposure Management, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (the 2017 Form 10-K), which has been incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement. We believe that general demographic trends in the U.S. population, the increase in under-insured individuals, the potential risk to governmental social safety net programs and the shifting of responsibility for retirement planning and financial security from employers and other institutions to individuals will create opportunities to generate significant demand for our products. We also believe our transition to an independent distribution system will enhance our ability to operate most effectively within the emerging requirements of the Department of Labor fiduciary rule (Fiduciary Rule) which sets forth a regulatory framework for the sale of insurance and annuity products to individual retirement accounts and individual retirement annuities (collectively, IRAs) and Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) qualified plans, which is a significant market for annuity products. See Business  Regulation  Department of Labor and ERISA Considerations in the 2017 Form 10-K and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Industry Trends  Regulatory Developments  Department of Labor and ERISA Considerations in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2018 (the First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q), each of which is incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement. Our Competitive Strengths We believe that our large in-force book of business, strong balance sheet, risk management strategy, experienced management team and focus on expense reduction allow us to capitalize on the attractive market environment and opportunities as we develop and grow our business on an independent basis.  Large in-force book of business . We are a major provider of life insurance and annuity products in the United States, with approximately 2.6 million insurance policies and annuity contracts at March 31, 2018. We believe our size and long-standing market presence position us well for potential future growth and margin expansion.  Our size provides opportunities to achieve economies of scale, permitting us to spread our fixed general and administrative costs, including expenditures on branding, over a large revenue base, resulting in a competitive expense ratio.  Our large policyholder base provides us with an opportunity to leverage underlying data to develop risk and policyholder insights, as well as implement operational best practices, permitting us to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors with the design and management of our products.  Our in-force book of business was sold by a wide range of distribution partners to whom we continue to pay trail and renewal commissions on the policies and contracts sold by them. For the year ended December 31, 2017, over 1,000 distribution firms or general agencies of our distributors received trail and renewal commissions. We believe this enhances our ability to maintain connectivity and relevance to those distributors. S-2 Table of Contents  Strong balance sheet. At March 31, 2018, we had total assets of $219.0 billion; total policyholder liabilities and other policy-related balances, including separate accounts, of $191.5 billion; and total stockholders equity of $13.6 billion, including AOCI. We intend to maintain and improve the strong statutory capitalization and financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries, as well as the diversity of invested asset classes.  Our insurance subsidiaries had combined statutory total adjusted capital of $6.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 resulting in a combined action level risk based capital in excess of 600% as of such date. As of March 31, 2018, our insurance subsidiaries had combined statutory total adjusted capital of $6.5 billion. We intend to support our variable annuity business with assets consistent with those required at the CTE95 standard (defined as the amount of assets required to satisfy contract holder obligations across market environments in the average of the worst five percent of 1,000 capital market scenarios over the life of the contracts (CTE95), consistent with guidelines promulgated by the NAIC). We held approximately $2.7 billion of assets in excess of CTE95 at March 31, 2018 to support our variable annuity book, which would be equivalent to holding assets at greater than a CTE98 standard as of such date (defined as the amount of assets required to satisfy contract holder obligations across market environments in the average of the worst two percent of 1,000 capital market scenarios over the life of the contracts (CTE98), consistent with guidelines promulgated by the NAIC).  We have strong financial strength ratings from the rating agencies that rate us. Financial strength ratings represent the opinions of the rating agencies regarding the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to meet their financial obligations to policyholders and contract holders and are not designed or intended for use by investors in evaluating our securities.  We have a diversified, high quality investment portfolio with $81.0 billion of general account assets at March 31, 2018, comprised of 78% fixed maturity securities, of which 95% were investment grade and 59% were U.S. corporate, government and agency securities.  Proven risk management and capital management expertise. We have brought to Brighthouse a strong risk management culture as demonstrated by our product decisions in recent years and our focused risk and capital management strategies for our existing book of business. We believe our insurance subsidiaries are capitalized at a level which is sufficient to maintain our financial strength ratings notwithstanding modest fluctuations in equity markets and interest rates in any given period. Further, over time by increasing the proportion of non-derivative, income-generating invested assets compared to derivative instruments supporting our variable annuity book of business, we believe our capital profile will be stronger and more able to mitigate a broader range of risk exposures.  Experienced senior management team with a proven track record of execution including producing cost savings. Our senior management team has an average of over 20 years of insurance industry experience. They have worked together to manage our business and reduce the cost base prior to the Distribution and continue to manage our business as a separate and focused individual life insurance and annuity company. The senior management team has taken significant actions over the last five years, including the following:  In 2012, MetLife announced a multi-year $1.0 billion gross expense savings initiative, which was substantially completed in 2015. This management team delivered approximately $200 million of expense savings with respect to MetLifes former Retail segment under that initiative.  The merger of three affiliated life insurance companies and a former offshore, reinsurance company affiliate that mainly reinsured guarantees associated with variable annuity products issued by MetLife affiliates to form our largest operating subsidiary, Brighthouse Life Insurance Company. S-3 Table of Contents  The consolidation of MetLifes former Retail segment in Charlotte, North Carolina, which, in addition to generating expense savings noted above, permitted our management to work together collaboratively at the same geographic location.  The sale of MetLifes former Retail segments proprietary distribution channel, MetLife Premier Client Group (MPCG), to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual), completing our transition to a more efficient acquisition cost distribution model through independent, third-party channel partners. As part of the sale, MetLife reduced its former Retail segment employee base by approximately 3,900 advisors and over 2,000 support employees. The sale of the proprietary distribution channel has enabled us to pursue a simplified, capital efficient product suite and reduce our fixed expense structure.  On July 31, 2016, MetLife entered into a multi-year outsourcing arrangement with Computer Sciences Corporation (now DXC Technology Company (DXC)) for the administration of certain in-force policies currently housed on up to 20 systems. Pursuant to this arrangement, at least 13 of such systems will be consolidated down to one. The arrangement provides administrative support for certain MetLife and Brighthouse policies, resulting in a phased net reduction in our overall expenses for maintenance over the next three to five years. Despite the separation of Brighthouse from MetLife, MetLife continues to oversee the transition of the administration of this business to DXC.  In December 2017, Brighthouse formalized a second arrangement with DXC for the administration of life and annuities new business and approximately 1.3 million in-force life and annuities contracts. Brighthouse is responsible for overseeing the transition of the administration of this business to DXC. Similar to the first contract, Brighthouse expects to achieve a variable expense structure and a phased net reduction in overall expenses for sales and administration maintenance of these contracts over the next three to five years. Our Business Strategy Our objective is to leverage our competitive strengths, to distinguish ourselves in the individual life insurance and annuity markets and over time increase the amount of statutory distributable cash generated by our business. We seek to achieve this by being a focused product manufacturer with an emphasis on independent distribution, while having a competitive expense ratio relative to our competitors. We intend to achieve our goals by executing on the following strategies:  Focus on target market segments. We intend to focus our sales and marketing efforts on those specific market segments where we believe we will best be able to sell products capable of producing attractive long-term value to our shareholders. In 2015, we conducted a survey of 7,000 U.S. customers with the goal of understanding our different market segments. Ultimately, the study revealed seven distinct segments based on both traditional demographic information including socio-economic information and an analysis of customer needs, attitudes and behaviors. Our review of the customer segmentation data resulted in our focusing product design and marketing on the following target customer segments:  Secure Seniors . This segment represented approximately 15% of the U.S. population. Because the customer segments are designed to reflect attitudes and behaviors, in addition to other factors, this segment includes a broad range in age, but is composed primarily of individuals between the ages of 55 to 70 about to retire or already in retirement, of which a majority have investible assets of greater than $500,000. Secure Seniors have higher net worth relative to the other customer segments and exhibit a strong desire to work with financial advisors. The larger share of assets, relative to the other segments, may make Secure Seniors an attractive market for financial security products and solutions. S-4 Table of Contents  Middle Aged Strivers . This segment represented approximately 23% of the U.S. population and was the largest customer segment of those identified by our survey. There is more diversity in this segment compared to the Secure Seniors in terms of amount of investible assets, age, life stage and potential lifetime value to us. The study indicates that these individuals tend to be in the early to later stages of family formation. Almost half of the population in this segment is between the ages of 40 and 55. They are focused on certain core needs, such as paying bills, reducing debt and protecting family wealth. We believe Middle Aged Strivers are an attractive market for protection products and many of these individuals will graduate to wealth and retirement products in their later years.  Diverse and Protected . This is the most diverse segment of the population, but was also the smallest constituting only 8% of the U.S. population. While this segment has lower income and investible assets than Secure Seniors and Middle Aged Strivers, our study indicates that they are active purchasers of insurance products. We believe that a portion of this segment, as they become older and more affluent, may purchase our annuity products in addition to our insurance products. We believe that these three customer segments represent a significant portion of the market opportunity, and by focusing our product development and marketing efforts to meeting the needs of these segments we will be able to offer a targeted set of products which will benefit our expense ratio thereby increasing our profitability. Our study also indicates that Secure Seniors, Middle Aged Strivers and Diverse and Protected customer segments are open to financial guidance and, accordingly, will be receptive to the products we intend to sell and we can share our insights about these segments to our distribution partners to increase the targeting efficiency of our sales efforts with them.  Focused manufacturer, with a simpler product suite designed to meet our customers and distributors needs . We intend to be financially disciplined in terms of the number of products which we offer and their risk-adjusted return profile, while being responsive to the needs of our customers and distribution partners.  We seek to manage our existing book of annuity business to mitigate the effects of severe market downturns and other economic effects on our statutory capital while preserving the ability to benefit from positive changes in equity markets and interest rates through our selection of derivative instruments.  We intend to offer products designed to produce statutory distributable cash flows on a more accelerated basis than those of some of our legacy in-force products. We will also focus on offering products which are more capital efficient than our pre-2013 generation of products. Our product design and sales strategies will focus on achieving long-term risk-adjusted distributable cash flows, rather than generating sales volumes or purchasing market share. We believe this approach aligns well with long-term value creation for our shareholders.  Our suite of structured annuities consists of products marketed under various names (collectively, Shield Annuities) and were introduced to respond to market downturns and consumer demands without compromising our risk-adjusted return hurdles. Shield Annuities provide contract holders with a specified level of market downside protection, sharing the balance of market downside risk with the contract holder, along with offering the contract holder tax-deferred accumulation.  Independent distribution with enhanced support and collaboration with key distributors . We believe that the completion of our transition from having both a captive sales force and third-party distributors to that of exclusively leveraging a diverse network of independent distributors will focus our distribution efforts and improve our profitability and capital efficiency.  We have proactively chosen to focus on independent distribution, which we believe aligns with our focus on product manufacturing. We believe distributing our products through only the S-5 Table of Contents independent distribution channel will enhance our ability to control our fixed costs, target our resources more appropriately and increase our profitability because we will be better able to leverage our product development and wholesale distribution capabilities.  Since 2001, we have successfully built third-party distribution relationships. Following the sale of MPCG to MassMutual, we are dedicated to supporting and expanding these relationships. We seek to become a leading provider of insurance and annuity products for our leading distribution partners by leveraging our marketing strengths which include customer segmentation, distribution servicing and sales support, as well as, our product management competencies. We believe that our distribution strategy will result in deeper relationships with these distribution partners.  As part of our collaborative approach with key distributors to leverage our product design expertise through tailored product arrangements, we launched a fixed index annuity (FIA) with MassMutual in July 2017. As part of our relationship with MassMutual, weve entered into a joint-wholesaling agreement, aimed at providing MassMutuals distribution channels, primarily career agency advisors, with easy access to product knowledge coverage.  Maintain strong statutory capitalization through an exposure management program intended to be effective across market environments.  The principal objective of our exposure management programs is to manage the risk to our statutory capitalization resulting from changes to equity markets and interest rates. This permits us to focus on the management of the long-term statutory distributable cash flow profile of our business and the underlying long-term returns of our product guarantees. See Risk Management Strategies in the 2017 Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus.  Our variable annuity exposure management program has four components:  We intend to support our variable annuities with assets consistent with those required at a CTE95 standard. At March 31, 2018, we held approximately $2.7 billion of assets in excess of CTE95, which would be equivalent to holding assets at greater than a CTE98 standard as of such date. We believe these excess assets will permit us to absorb modest losses, which may be temporary, from changes in equity markets and interest rates without adversely affecting our financial strength ratings.  We will continue to enter into derivative instruments to offset the impact on our statutory capital from more significant changes to equity markets and interest rates.  We believe the earnings from our large and seasoned block of in-force business will provide an additional means of increasing and regenerating our statutory capital organically to the extent it may have been eroded due to periodic changes in equity markets and interest rates.  We intend to invest a portion of the assets supporting our variable annuity asset requirements in income-generating investments, which we believe will provide an additional means to increase or regenerate our statutory capital.  We have a large in-force block of life insurance policies and annuity contracts that we actively manage to improve profitability, prudently minimize exposures, grow cash margins and release capital for shareholders in the medium to long-term.  Focus on operating cost and flexibility. A key element of our strategy is to leverage our infrastructure over time to be a lean, flexible, cost-competitive operator.  We will continue our focus on reducing our cost base while maintaining strong service levels for our policyholders and contract holders. As part of separating our business processes and systems from MetLife, we are taking a phased approach to re-engineering our processes and S-6 Table of Contents systems across all functional areas. This phased transition is expected to occur over the coming few years. We are planning on run-rate operating cost reductions as part of this initiative.  We have identified and are actively pursuing several initiatives that we expect will make our business less complex, more flexible and better able to adapt to changing market conditions. Consistent with this strategy, MetLife sold MPCG to MassMutual, completing our transition to a more efficient acquisition cost distribution model and reducing its former Retail segment employee base by approximately 5,900 employees.  We intend to leverage emerging technology and outsourcing arrangements to become more profitable. Examples of this include our decision to outsource the administration of new business and certain in-force policies to DXC. The Underwriting, Debt-for-Equity Exchange and Third Party Tender Offer On May 15, 2018, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo Securities, the selling stockholders in the debt-for-equity exchange described below, commenced offers to purchase (the tender offers) as principals for their own account for cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offer to purchase, dated May 15, 2018 and the related letter of transmittal, up to $900 million aggregate purchase price of certain outstanding indebtedness issued by MetLife. The early tender date for the tender offers was May 29, 2018. On the early tender date, the selling stockholders announced an increase in the aggregate purchase price of indebtedness to be purchased in the tender offers to $1,150 million, and on May 30, 2018, the early settlement date, the selling stockholders purchased approximately $1,120 million aggregate principal amount of such indebtedness. The tender offers expire on June 12, 2018 at 11:59 P.M. (New York City time). In connection with this offering, pursuant to a debt-for-equity exchange agreement to be dated the date of this prospectus supplement, MetLife will exchange shares of Brighthouse common stock for approximately $ million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness of MetLife that is owned by the selling stockholders. The selling stockholders are Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo Securities, who are also the underwriters in this offering. The selling stockholders then intend to sell those shares of common stock for cash pursuant to this offering. The debt-for-equity exchange between MetLife and the selling stockholders will occur on the date of this prospectus supplement. We refer to this exchange between MetLife and the selling stockholders as the debt-for-equity exchange. We expect that, in the debt-for-equity exchange, MetLife will assign to the selling stockholders the registration rights associated with shares of Brighthouse common stock under the registration rights agreement, dated as of August 4, 2017 (the Registration Rights Agreement), between us and MetLife, subject to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement. We will enter into a consent and waiver with MetLife pursuant to which we will consent to the assignment of MetLifes rights under the Registration Rights Agreement to each of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo Securities in respect of all shares of common stock to be transferred in the debt-for-equity exchange. As a result of the debt-for-equity exchange, MetLife may be deemed to be a selling stockholder in this offering solely for U.S. federal securities law purposes. The indebtedness of MetLife that is owned by the selling stockholders and available for the debt-for-equity exchange has an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1,120 million. The amount of such indebtedness of MetLife owned by the selling stockholders is expected to be sufficient to acquire from MetLife pursuant to the debt-for-equity exchange all of the shares of common stock to be sold in this offering. MetLife has informed us that, subsequent to the completion of the debt-for-equity exchange, the MetLife indebtedness exchanged in such debt-for-equity exchange will be canceled. We do not guarantee, or have any obligation in respect of, such MetLife indebtedness.

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 5121, the appointment of a qualified independent underwriter is not necessary in connection with this offering because the offering is of a class of equity securities for which a bona fide public market, as defined by FINRA Rule 5121(f)(3), exists.

These stabilizing transactions may include making short sales of the common stock, which involves the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of common stock than it is required to purchase in this offering, and purchasing shares of common stock on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. The underwriters have advised us that, pursuant to Regulation M of the Securities Act, they may also engage in other activities that stabilize, maintain, or otherwise affect the price of the common stock. These activities may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the common stock, and, as a result, the price of the common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If the underwriters commence these activities, they may discontinue them at any time. The underwriters may carry out these transactions on the Nasdaq, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. Conflicts of Interest and Relationships This offering is being conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of Rule 5121 of the FINRA Conduct Rules. The underwriters will have a conflict of interest pursuant to FINRA Rule 5121(f)(5)(C)(ii) by virtue of their role as selling stockholders because all of the net proceeds of this offering will be received by the selling stockholders. As such, the underwriters will not confirm any sales to any account over which they exercise discretionary authority without the specific written approval of the transaction from the account holder. Pursuant to FINRA Rule 5121, the appointment of a qualified independent underwriter is not necessary in connection with this offering because the offering is of a class of equity securities for which a bona fide public market, as defined by FINRA Rule 5121(f)(3), exists. The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The underwriters and certain of their affiliates have provided in the past to us, MetLife and our and MetLifes respective affiliates and may provide from time to time in the future certain commercial banking, financial advisory, investment banking and other services for us, MetLife and such affiliates in the ordinary course of their business, for which they have received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions. In particular, the underwriters or their respective affiliates are party to our Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of December 2, 2016. In addition, in the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investment and securities activities may involve our securities and instruments. The underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. The Debt-for-Equity Exchange MetLife and the selling stockholders will enter into a debt-for-equity exchange agreement as of the date of this prospectus supplement. The selling stockholders are Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo Securities, who are also the underwriters in this offering. Under the debt-for-equity exchange agreement, on the date of this prospectus supplement, MetLife will exchange the shares of common stock to be sold in this offering for certain outstanding indebtedness of MetLife owned by the selling stockholders. The selling stockholders then intend to sell those shares for cash pursuant to this offering. S-18 Table of Contents The indebtedness of MetLife that is owned by the selling stockholders and available for use in the debt-for-equity exchange has an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1,120 million. The amount of such indebtedness of MetLife owned by the selling stockholders is expected to be sufficient to acquire from MetLife pursuant to the debt-for-equity exchange all of the shares of common stock to be sold in this offering. The pricing with respect to the debt-for-equity exchange will (i) be negotiated at arms length, (ii) involve a fixed dollar amount and (iii) not contain any variable component. The selling stockholders will acquire and sell the shares as principal for their own accounts, rather than on MetLifes behalf. Under the debt-for-equity exchange agreement described above, the selling stockholders will become the owners of our shares of common stock they acquire in the debt-for-equity exchange as of the date of this prospectus supplement. The selling stockholders, and not Brighthouse or MetLife, will receive the net proceeds from the sale of the shares in this offering. Under U.S. federal securities laws, the selling stockholders will be deemed to be the underwriters with respect to any shares of common stock that they acquire in the debt-for-equity exchange and sell in this offering; however, references to the underwriters in this prospectus supplement refer only to the underwriters listed in the first paragraph of this Underwriting (Conflicts of Interest) section.

Our Company We are a major provider of annuity products and life insurance in the United States through multiple independent distribution channels and marketing arrangements with a diverse network of distribution partners. Our in-force book of products consists of approximately 2.6 million insurance policies and annuity contracts at March 31, 2018, which are organized into three reporting segments: (i) Annuities, which includes variable, fixed, index-linked and income annuities; (ii) Life, which includes variable, term, universal and whole life policies; and (iii) Run-off, which consists of operations related to products which we are not actively selling and which are separately managed. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations not included in the segments in Corporate & Other. At March 31, 2018, we had $219.0 billion of total assets with total stockholders equity of $13.6 billion, including accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI); approximately $622.0 billion of life insurance face amount in-force and $146.7 billion of annuity assets under management (AUM), which we define as our general account investments and our separate account assets.

You should consider carefully all of the risks described under Risk Factors below, as well the risk factors and other information contained in this prospectus, any prospectus supplement, and our 2017 Form 10-K and our First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q, which are each incorporated by reference herein, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. See Where You Can Find Additional Information below. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock Our stock price may fluctuate significantly We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;  success or failure of our business strategies;  our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;  our ability to obtain financing as needed;  our announcements or our competitors announcements regarding new products or services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;  changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;  the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;  failure to meet any targets given by us or any change in any targets given by us, or changes by us to our targets practices;  the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;  investor perception of our company and the insurance industry;  speculation in the press or investment community;  our business profile, dividend policy or market capitalization;  actions by institutional stockholders and other large stockholders (including MetLife), including future sales of our common stock;  overall market fluctuations;  results from any material litigation or government investigation;  changes in laws, rules and regulations, including insurance laws and regulations, affecting our business;  changes in our customers preferences;  changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting shareholders;  epidemic disease, Acts of God, war and terrorist acts;  failure to properly administer or pay claims;  additions or departures of key personnel; and  general economic conditions and other external factors. 4 Table of Contents Stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We do not anticipate declaring or paying regular dividends on our common stock in the near term, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock We do not currently anticipate declaring or paying regular cash dividends on our common stock in the near term. We currently intend to use our future earnings, if any, to pay debt obligations, to fund our growth, to develop our business, for working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock in the near term, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have received their shares. Any future declaration and payment of dividends or other distributions of capital will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors (the Board) and the payment of any future dividends or other distributions of capital will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, cash needs, regulatory constraints, capital requirements (including requirements of our subsidiaries) and any other factors that our Board deems relevant in making such a determination. In addition, the terms of the agreements governing the debt we incurred, or debt that we may incur, may limit or prohibit the payment of dividends. For more information, see Dividend Policy. There can be no assurance that we will establish a dividend policy or pay dividends in the future or continue to pay any dividend if we do commence paying dividends pursuant to a dividend policy or otherwise. The selling stockholder owns 23,155,117 shares of our common stock. We are registering such shares on a registration statement on Form S-1, of which this prospectus forms a part, under the terms of a registration rights agreement between us and the selling stockholder. The sale of such shares in one or more offerings or any other future sales may cause our stock price to decline Any sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur, in connection with this offering or otherwise, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Upon completion of the offering, we will continue to have an aggregate of approximately 119.8 million shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Shares will generally be freely tradeable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for shares owned by one of our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act. Shares held by affiliates may be sold in the public market if registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144 under the Securities Act which is summarized under Shares Eligible for Future Sale  Rule 144. Further, on May 25, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-8 registering an aggregate of 8,000,000 shares of common stock underlying equity awards we have made and will make to our employees and certain other qualifying individuals, and the resale of those shares of common stock. The selling stockholder owns 23,155,117 shares of our common stock. Upon the Separation, MetLife informed us that it intends to ultimately dispose of its remaining ownership interest in Brighthouse as soon as practicable following the Distribution, but in no event later than five years after the Distribution. MetLife has subsequently announced that, subject to market conditions and regulatory approval, it currently intends to divest of its remaining ownership interest during 2018 through one or more transactions, including an exchange offer for MetLife common stock, a direct sale of our shares held by MetLife, or an exchange offer for MetLife debt securities. See Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions  Agreements Between Us and MetLife  Registration Rights Agreement in our 2017 Form 10-K incorporated by reference into this prospectus. We are registering on a registration statement on Form S-1, of which this prospectus forms a part, such shares under the terms of a registration rights agreement, dated as of August 4, 2017, between us and the selling stockholder (the Registration Rights Agreement). Any disposition by MetLife of our common stock in the public market in one or more offerings, or the perception that such dispositions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. 5 Table of Contents We also have a large shareholder base of former MetLife policyholder trust beneficiaries, and it is not possible to predict whether or not those shareholders will wish to sell their shares of our common stock. The sales of significant amounts of shares our common stock or the perception in the market that this will occur may result in the lowering of the market price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers or stockholders Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our current or former directors, officers or stockholders, (iii) action asserting a claim arising out of or pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL) or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (iv) action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. By becoming a stockholder in our company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or any of our current or former directors, officers or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Your percentage ownership in Brighthouse may be diluted in the future Your percentage ownership in Brighthouse may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that we expect to grant to our directors, officers and employees. We have approved equity incentive plans that will provide for the grant of common stock-based equity awards to our directors, officers and other employees. Our shareholders approved these equity incentive plans at our annual meeting of stockholders held on May 23, 2018. In addition, we may issue equity as all or part of the consideration paid for acquisitions and strategic investments we may make in the future or for currently unanticipated future development or unforeseen circumstances, given uncertainties related to our business. State insurance laws and Delaware corporate law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock State laws may delay, deter, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. For example, such laws may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. The insurance laws and regulations of the various states in which our insurance subsidiaries are organized may delay or impede a business combination involving the Company. State insurance laws prohibit an entity from acquiring control of an insurance company without the prior approval of the domestic insurance regulator. Under most states statutes, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. These regulatory restrictions may delay, deter or prevent a potential merger or sale of our company, even if our Board decides that it is in the best interests of stockholders for us to merge or be sold. These restrictions also may delay sales by us or acquisitions by third parties of our insurance subsidiaries. In addition, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, may require approval by the contract owners of our variable contracts in order to effectuate a change 6 Table of Contents of control of any affiliated investment advisor to a mutual fund underlying our variable contracts, including Brighthouse Investment Advisers, LLC, formerly known as MetLife Advisers LLC. Further, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) approval would be necessary for a change of control of any broker-dealer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of Brighthouse. Section 203 of the DGCL may affect the ability of an interested stockholder to engage in certain business combinations, including, among other things, mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares of our capital stock, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is defined to include persons who, together with affiliates, own, or did own within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:  the inability of our stockholders to act by written consent;  rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;  the right of our Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;  the ability of our remaining directors to fill vacancies and newly created directorships on our Board;  the division of our Board into classes of directors until such times as all directors are elected annually commencing at the Companys 2020 annual meeting of stockholders;  the inability of our stockholders to remove directors other than for cause while the Board is classified; and  the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding voting stock is required to amend certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and to amend our amended and restated bylaws. We believe these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board and by providing our Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board determines is not in the best interests of Brighthouse and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. For additional tax considerations, see Risk Factors  Risks Relating to the Distribution  We have agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the non-recognition treatment of the transactions, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility in our 2017 Form 10-K incorporated by reference into this prospectus. 7 Table of Contents NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus, any accompanying prospectus supplement, the documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus, and other written or oral statements that we make from time to time may contain information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements using words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, may, will, could, intend, goal, target, forecast, objective, continue, aim, plan, believe and other words and terms of similar meaning, or that are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include, without limitation, statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operating and financial results, as well as statements regarding the expected benefits of the Separation and the recapitalization actions. Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the actual future results of Brighthouse. These statements are based on current expectations and the current economic environment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Although it is not possible to identify all of these risks and factors, they include, among others:  differences between actual experience and actuarial assumptions and the effectiveness of our actuarial models;  higher risk management costs and exposure to increased counterparty risk due to guarantees within certain of our products;  the effectiveness of our exposure management strategy and the impact of such strategy on net income volatility and negative effects on our statutory capital;  the additional reserves we will be required to hold against our variable annuities as a result of actuarial guidelines;  a sustained period of low equity market prices and interest rates that are lower than those we assumed when we issued our variable annuity products;  our degree of leverage due to indebtedness incurred in connection with the Separation;  the effect adverse capital and credit market conditions may have on our ability to meet liquidity needs and our access to capital;  the impact of changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies on our insurance business or other operations;  the effectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures;  the availability of reinsurance and the ability of our counterparties to our reinsurance or indemnification arrangements to perform their obligations thereunder;  heightened competition, including with respect to service, product features, scale, price, actual or perceived financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities and name recognition;  changes in accounting standards, practices and/or policies applicable to us;  the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders; 8 Table of Contents  our ability to market and distribute our products through distribution channels;  the impact of the Separation on our business and profitability due to MetLifes strong brand and reputation, the increased costs related to replacing arrangements with MetLife with those of third parties and incremental costs as a public company;  any failure of third parties to provide services we need, any failure of the practices and procedures of these third parties and any inability to obtain information or assistance we need from third parties, including MetLife;  whether the operational, strategic and other benefits of the Separation can be achieved, and our ability to implement our business strategy;  whether all or any portion of the Separation tax consequences are not as expected, leading to material additional taxes or material adverse consequences to tax attributes that impact us;  the uncertainty of the outcome of any disputes with MetLife over tax-related or other matters and agreements including the potential of outcomes adverse to us that could cause us to owe MetLife material tax reimbursements or payments or disagreements regarding MetLifes or our obligations under our other agreements;  the impact on our business structure, profitability, cost of capital and flexibility due to restrictions we have agreed to that preserve the tax-free treatment of certain parts of the Separation;  changes to the timing of the subsequent disposal of the equity retained by MetLife;  the potential material negative tax impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other potential future tax legislation that could decrease the value of our tax attributes, lead to increased risk-based capital (RBC) requirements and cause other cash expenses, such as reserves, to increase materially and make some of our products less attractive to consumers;  whether the Distribution will qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes and potential indemnification to MetLife if the Distribution does not so qualify;  our ability to attract and retain key personnel; and  other factors described in this prospectus, any accompanying prospectus supplement and the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus. You should read this prospectus, and any accompanying prospectus supplement, as well as our 2017 Form 10-K and our First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q, which are each incorporated by reference herein, completely and with the understanding that actual future results may be materially different from expectations. All forward-looking statements made in this prospectus, any accompanying prospectus supplement and the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference herein or therein are qualified by these cautionary statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as otherwise may be required by law. 9 Table of Contents USE OF PROCEEDS All shares of our common stock sold pursuant to this prospectus will be offered and sold by the selling stockholder. We will not receive any proceeds from such sale. 10 Table of Contents MARKET PRICE OF SHARES Our shares of common stock have been listed and traded on Nasdaq under the symbol BHF since July 5, 2017, when they were approved for listing. Our common stock began regular-way trading on August 7, 2017, the first trading day after the Distribution. On June 11, 2018, the last sale price of our common stock as reported on Nasdaq was $46.74 per share. As of June 1, 2018, there were 2,388,598 holders of record of our common stock. Because many of our shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these recordholders. The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported on Nasdaq: High Low Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2017: Third quarter (beginning August 7, 2017) $ 62.85 $ 52.75 Fourth quarter $ 63.66 $ 54.61 Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2018: First quarter $ 67.55 $ 49.62 Second quarter (through June 11, 2018) $ 52.77 $ 46.14 11 Table of Contents DIVIDEND POLICY We do not currently anticipate declaring or paying regular cash dividends on our common stock in the near term. Any future declaration and payment of dividends or other distributions of capital will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our financial condition, earnings, cash needs, regulatory constraints, capital requirements (including requirements of our subsidiaries) and any other factors that our Board deems relevant in making such a determination. In addition, the terms of the agreements governing the debt we have incurred or may incur may limit or prohibit the payment of dividends. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock, or as to the amount of any such dividends or other distributions of capital. Delaware law requires that dividends be paid only out of surplus, which is defined as the fair market value of our net assets, minus our stated capital; or out of the current or the immediately preceding years earnings. We are a holding company, and we have no direct operations. All of our business operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. The states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled impose certain restrictions on our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us. These restrictions are based in part on the prior years statutory income and surplus. Such restrictions, or any future restrictions adopted by the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, could have the effect, under certain circumstances, of significantly reducing dividends or other amounts payable to us by our subsidiaries without affirmative approval of state regulatory authorities. For more details, see Risk Factors  Capital-Related Risks  As a holding company, Brighthouse Financial, Inc. depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends, Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Common Stock  We do not anticipate declaring or paying regular dividends or making other distributions on our common stock in the near term, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Company  Capital  Restrictions on Dividends and Returns of Capital from Insurance Company Subsidiaries and Regulation  Insurance Regulation  Holding Company Regulation in our 2017 Form 10-K incorporated by reference into this prospectus. 12 Table of Contents SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The following tables set forth selected historical financial data for Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (formerly, the MetLife U.S. Retail Separation Business).

Authorized Capital Stock Our authorized capital stock consists of 1,100,000,000 shares, which is divided into two classes, consisting of 1,000,000,000 shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share. As of June 1, 2018, we had 119,773,106 outstanding shares of our common stock, held of record by 2,388,598 holders of record, and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. We have no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock. Common Stock Dividend Rights . Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of our preferred stock, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of any of our funds legally available therefor when, as and if declared by our Board at its discretion. Voting Rights . Each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election of directors, and, subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding series of preferred stock as provided in any preferred stock certificate of designation approved by our Board, the holders of our common stock possess all voting power. Except as required by applicable law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Company and except with respect to the election of directors, the amendment of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the amendment of our amended and restated bylaws, all matters to be voted on by stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. The election of directors at a meeting at which a quorum is present is determined by a plurality of the votes cast in respect of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote, meaning that the nominees with the greatest number of votes received, even if less than a majority, will be elected. The amended and restated bylaws provide that in an uncontested election any director who receives a greater number of votes withheld than votes cast in favor of his or her election shall tender his or her resignation from the Board of Directors to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would then recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject such resignation and the Board of Directors would publicly disclose its decision in regard to such resignation. Liquidation . If we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our affairs, holders of our common stock are entitled to share proportionately in the assets available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all of our debt and other liabilities, subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of our preferred stock. Other Rights . Holders of our common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. All outstanding shares of our common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that our Board may designate and issue in the future. 23 Table of Contents Preferred Stock Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by our stockholders, to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix, among other items, the voting powers, designations, preferences and the relative participating, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of each series, including without limitation dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series. No shares of our authorized preferred stock are currently outstanding. Because the Board of Directors has the power to establish the preferences and rights of the shares of any additional series of preferred stock, it may afford holders of any preferred stock preferences, powers and rights, including voting and dividend rights, senior to the rights of holders of our common stock, which could delay, discourage or prevent a takeover of us even if a change of control of our company would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. There are no current agreements or understandings with respect to the issuance of preferred stock. Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Applicable Law Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, as well as certain provisions of Delaware law and insurance regulations applicable to our business, may discourage or make more difficult a takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in his or her best interest. These provisions may also adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. We believe that the benefits of increased protection give us the potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us and outweigh the disadvantage of discouraging those proposals because negotiation of the proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. Classified Board . Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our Board be divided into three classes. For so long as there are three classes of directors, each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of directors. The directors designated as Class II directors will have terms expiring at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, and the directors designated as Class I and Class III directors will have terms expiring at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. Commencing with the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, the directors shall be divided into two classes, with the directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms then expire ( i.e. , the former Class I directors) being elected for a term of office to expire at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders ( i.e. , as Class III directors). Commencing with the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, there shall be a single class of directors, with directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms then expire ( i.e. , the former Class II directors) being elected for a term of office to expire at the 2020 annual meeting. Commencing with the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, each director elected to succeed those directors whose terms then expire shall be elected annually and for a term of office to expire at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and our Board will thereafter no longer be divided into classes. Before our Board is declassified, it would take at least two annual elections of directors for any individual or group to gain control of our Board. Accordingly, while the Board is divided into classes, these provisions could discourage a third party from initiating a proxy contest, making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to control us. Removal . Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that (i) for so long as the Board is divided into classes, the holders of at least two-thirds of the combined voting power of the then outstanding stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors may remove any director, but only for cause, and that (ii) from and after the time that the Board is no longer divided into classes, stockholders may remove our directors with or without cause by the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Size of Board and Vacancies . Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that the number of directors will be fixed exclusively by the Board; provided, however , 24 Table of Contents that in no event shall such number of directors be less than three (3) nor more than fifteen (15). Any newly created directorships created on our Board resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause will be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director. Any director appointed to fill a vacancy on our Board shall hold office for the remainder of the term of the class, if any, that such director has been appointed to and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified or until such directors earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal. Stockholder Action by Written Consent . Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits our stockholders from acting by written consent. Stockholder action may only take place at a duly called annual or special meeting of our stockholders. Requirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals . Our amended and restated bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and nomination of candidates for election as directors. No Cumulative Voting . Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting. Undesignated Preferred Stock . The authority that our Board possesses to issue preferred stock could potentially be used to discourage attempts by third parties to obtain control of us through a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making such attempts more difficult. Our Board can issue preferred stock with voting rights or conversion rights that, if exercised, could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock. Amendments to Bylaws . Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that in addition to any other vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the capital stock of the Company that may be required, our amended and restated bylaws may only be amended by our Board or by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds in voting power of the issued and outstanding voting stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class. Amendments to Charter . Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in addition to any other vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the capital stock of the Company that may be required, certain charter provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds in voting power of the issued and outstanding voting stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law As a Delaware corporation, are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A business combination includes, among other things, a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or did own within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, 15% or more of the corporations voting stock. Under Section 203, a business combination between a corporation and an interested stockholder is prohibited unless one of the following conditions is satisfied:  before the stockholder became an interested stockholder, the Board approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;  upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation 25 Table of Contents outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding, for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding, shares owned by persons who are directors and officers; or  at or after the time the stockholder became interested, the business combination was approved by the Board and authorized at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. This provision would be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our Board, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by our stockholders. Insurance Regulations The insurance laws and regulations of the various states in which our insurance subsidiaries are organized may delay or impede a business combination involving us. State insurance laws prohibit an entity from acquiring control of an insurance company without the prior approval of the domestic insurance regulator. Under most states statutes, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. These regulatory restrictions may delay, deter or prevent a potential merger or sale of our company, even if the Board decides that it is in the best interests of stockholders for us to merge or be sold. These restrictions also may delay sales by us or acquisitions by third parties of our subsidiaries. See Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Common Stock  State insurance laws and Delaware corporate law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock and Regulation  Insurance Regulation in the 2017 Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus. Choice of Forum Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our current or former directors, officers or stockholders, (iii) action asserting a claim arising out of or pursuant to the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. By becoming a stockholder in our company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. Limitation of Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers The DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors fiduciary duties as directors and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will include such an exculpation provision. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as it now exists or may hereafter be amended, none of our directors will be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Under the DGCL as it now reads, such limitation of liability is not permitted:  for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;  for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;  for payments of unlawful dividends or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions under Section 174 of the DGCL; or 26 Table of Contents  for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. These provisions will have no effect on the availability of equitable remedies such as an injunction or rescission based on a directors breach of his or her duty of care. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws include provisions that require us to indemnify and advance expenses, to the fullest extent allowable under the DGCL as it now exists or may hereafter be amended, to our directors or officers for actions taken as a director or officer of us, or for serving at our request as a director or officer at another corporation or enterprise, as the case may be. Section 145 of the DGCL provides that a corporation may indemnify directors and officers, as well as other employees and individuals, against expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement, that are incurred in connection with various actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, other than an action by or in the right of the corporation, known as a derivative action, if they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, if they had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful. A similar standard is applicable in the case of derivative actions, except that indemnification only extends to expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such actions, and the statute requires court approval before there can be any indemnification if the person seeking indemnification has been found liable to the corporation. The statute provides that it is not exclusive of other indemnification that may be granted by a corporations bylaws, disinterested director vote, stockholder vote, agreement or otherwise. Our amended and restated bylaws require us to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or was otherwise involved in, a legal proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Company or is or was serving at our request as a director or officer of another corporation or enterprise, as the case may be, to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL as it now exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, Employee Retirement Income Security Act excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such director or officer in connection with such service. The right to indemnification in our amended and restated bylaws includes the right to be paid by the Company the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding for which indemnification may be sought in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding, subject to certain limitations. We carry directors and officers insurance protecting us, any director, officer, employee or agent of ours or who was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or enterprise, as the case may be, against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not we would have the power to indemnify the person under the DGCL. The limitation of liability and indemnification and advancement provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of fiduciary duty. These provisions also may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. In addition, your investment in our common stock may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards under these indemnification provisions. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling Brighthouse pursuant to the foregoing provisions, Brighthouse has been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. 27 Table of Contents Listing Our common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol BHF. Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A. The transfer agents address is 480 Washington Boulevard, Jersey City, NJ 07310. 28 Table of Contents SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE Our common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol BHF. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect market prices prevailing from time to time and future distributions of the shares owned by MetLife could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Sale of Restricted Shares As of June 1, 2018, we have approximately 119,773,106 shares of common stock outstanding, excluding shares awarded pursuant to equity award arrangements with directors and employees, and MetLife owns 23,155,117 shares of our common stock as of June 12, 2018. Of these shares, all of the shares of our common stock that holders of MetLife common stock, including trust beneficiaries, received in the Distribution are, and all of the shares sold pursuant to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part will be freely transferable without restriction under the Securities Act, unless purchased by our affiliates as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. All 23,155,117 shares held by MetLife as of June 12, 2018 are restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, but will no longer be restricted securities to the extent they are registered and sold (other than to our affiliates) pursuant to this registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are so registered and sold under the Securities Act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Rule 144 In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, a person (or persons whose shares are aggregated) who is not deemed to be or have been one of our affiliates for purposes of the Securities Act at any time during 90 days preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner other than an affiliate, is entitled to sell such shares without registration, subject to compliance with the public information requirements of Rule 144. If such a person has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least one year, including the holding period of a prior owner other than an affiliate, then such person is entitled to sell such shares without complying with any of the requirements of Rule 144. In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, our affiliates or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates, who have met the six-month holding period for beneficial ownership of restricted shares of our common stock, are entitled to sell within any three-month period, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of:  1.0% of our then-outstanding shares of common stock, which will equal approximately 1,197,731 shares immediately after this offering; and  the average weekly trading volume of our common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice of the sale on Form 144. Sales under Rule 144 by our affiliates or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are also subject to certain manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us. The sale of these shares, or the perception that sales will be made, could adversely affect the price of our common stock after this offering because a great supply of shares would be, or would be perceived to be, available for sale in the public market. Registration Statement on Form S-8 On May 25, 2018, we filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-8 registering an aggregate of 8,000,000 shares of common stock underlying equity awards we have made and will make to our employees and 29 Table of Contents certain other qualifying individuals, and the resale of those shares of common stock. The Form S-8 became effective upon filing and shares of common stock so registered will become freely tradable when issued. Registration Rights Agreement As described in Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions  Agreements Between Us and MetLife  Registration Rights Agreement included in our 2017 Form 10-K incorporated by reference herein, we have entered into the Registration Rights Agreement with MetLife. This prospectus is part of the registration statement filed pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. We do not have any other contractual obligations to register our common stock. 30 Table of Contents CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock by Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below) that purchase such common stock pursuant to this offering and hold such common stock as a capital asset. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated or proposed thereunder, and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as in effect on the date hereof and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, or to different interpretation. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to specific Non-U.S. Holders in light of their particular circumstances or to Non-U.S. Holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law (such as banks, insurance companies, dealers in securities or other Non-U.S. Holders that generally mark their securities to market for U.S. federal income tax purposes, foreign governments, international organizations, tax-exempt entities, certain former citizens or residents of the United States, or Non-U.S. Holders that hold our common stock as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion or other integrated transaction). This discussion does not address any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax considerations or any U.S. federal gift, Medicare contribution or alternative minimum tax considerations. As used in this discussion, the term Non-U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of our common stock that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is:  an individual who is neither a citizen nor a resident of the United States;  a corporation that is not created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;  an estate that is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on income from non-U.S. sources which is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States; or  a trust unless (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or (ii) it has in effect a valid election under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes invests in our common stock, the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to such investment will depend in part upon the status and activities of such entity and the particular partner. Any such entity should consult its own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to it and its partners relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock. PERSONS CONSIDERING AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME, ESTATE AND OTHER TAX CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. Distributions on Common Stock If we make a distribution of cash or other property (other than certain pro rata distributions of our common stock or rights to acquire our common stock) with respect to a share of our common stock, the distribution generally will be treated as a dividend to the extent it is paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). If the amount of such distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such excess generally will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of the Non-U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in such share of our common stock, and then as capital gain (which will be treated in the manner described below under  Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition 31 Table of Contents of Common Stock). Distributions treated as dividends on our common stock that are paid to or for the account of a Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30%, or at a lower rate if provided by an applicable tax treaty and the Non-U.S. Holder provides the documentation (generally, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) required to claim benefits under such tax treaty to the applicable withholding agent. Even if our current or accumulated earnings and profits are less than the amount of the distribution, the applicable withholding agent may elect to treat the entire distribution as a dividend for U.S. federal withholding tax purposes. Each Non-U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding U.S. federal withholding tax on distributions, including such Non-U.S. Holders eligibility for a lower rate and the availability of a refund of any excess U.S. federal tax withheld. If, however, a dividend is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by a Non-U.S. Holder, such dividend generally will not be subject to the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax if such Non-U.S. Holder provides the appropriate documentation (generally, IRS Form W-8ECI) to the applicable withholding agent. Instead, such Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such dividend in substantially the same manner as a U.S. person (except as provided by an applicable tax treaty). In addition, a Non-U.S. Holder that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate if provided by an applicable tax treaty) on its effectively connected income for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments. The foregoing discussion is subject to the discussion below under  FATCA Withholding and  Information Reporting and Backup Withholding. Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Stock A Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock unless: (i) such gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by such Non-U.S. Holder, in which event such Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such gain in substantially the same manner as a U.S. person (except as provided by an applicable tax treaty) and, if it is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, may also be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate if provided by an applicable tax treaty); (ii) such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of such sale, exchange or other disposition and certain other conditions are met, in which event such gain (net of certain U.S. source losses) generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (except as provided by an applicable tax treaty); or (iii) we are or have been a United States real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of (x) the five-year period ending on the date of such sale, exchange or other disposition and (y) such Non-U.S. Holders holding period with respect to such common stock, and certain other conditions are met. Generally, a corporation is a United States real property holding corporation if the fair market value of its United States real property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business (all as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes). We believe that we presently are not, and we do not presently anticipate that we will become, a United States real property holding corporation. 32 Table of Contents The foregoing discussion is subject to the discussion below under  FATCA Withholding and  Information Reporting and Backup Withholding. FATCA Withholding Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act provisions of the Code and related U.S. Treasury guidance (FATCA), a withholding tax of 30% will be imposed in certain circumstances on payments of (i) dividends on our common stock and (ii) on or after January 1, 2019, gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our common stock. In the case of payments made to a foreign financial institution (such as a bank, a broker, an investment fund or, in certain cases, a holding company), as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary, this tax generally will be imposed, subject to certain exceptions, unless such institution (i) has agreed to (and does) comply with the requirements of an agreement with the United States (an FFI Agreement) or (ii) is required by (and does comply with) applicable foreign law enacted in connection with an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and a foreign jurisdiction (an IGA) to, among other things, collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities or other relevant tax authorities certain information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution and, in either case, such institution provides the withholding agent with a certification as to its FATCA status. In the case of payments made to a foreign entity that is not a financial institution (as a beneficial owner), the tax generally will be imposed, subject to certain exceptions, unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification as to its FATCA status and, in certain cases, identifies any substantial U.S. owner (generally, any specified U.S. person that directly or indirectly owns more than a specified percentage of such entity). If our common stock is held through a foreign financial institution that has agreed to comply with the requirements of an FFI Agreement or is subject to similar requirements under applicable foreign law enacted in connection with an IGA, such foreign financial institution (or, in certain cases, a person paying amounts to such foreign financial institution) generally will be required, subject to certain exceptions, to withhold tax on payments made to (i) a person (including an individual) that fails to provide any required information or documentation or (ii) a foreign financial institution that has not agreed to comply with the requirements of an FFI Agreement and is not subject to similar requirements under applicable foreign law enacted in connection with an IGA. Each Non-U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the application of FATCA to the ownership and disposition of our common stock. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Amounts treated as payments of dividends on our common stock paid to a Non-U.S. Holder and the amount of any U.S. federal tax withheld from such payments generally will be reported annually to the IRS and to such Non-U.S. Holder by the applicable withholding agent. The information reporting and backup withholding rules that apply to payments of dividends to certain U.S. persons generally will not apply to payments of dividends on our common stock to a Non-U.S. Holder if such Non-U.S. Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person (generally by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E to the applicable withholding agent) or otherwise establishes an exemption. Proceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock by a Non-U.S. Holder effected outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker generally will not be subject to the information reporting and backup withholding rules that apply to payments to certain U.S. persons, provided that the proceeds are paid to the Non-U.S. Holder outside the United States. However, proceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock by a Non-U.S. Holder effected through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker with certain specified U.S. connections or of a U.S. broker generally will be subject to these information reporting rules (but generally not to these backup withholding rules), even if the proceeds are paid to such Non-U.S. Holder outside the United States, unless such Non-U.S. Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person (generally by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E to the applicable withholding agent) or otherwise establishes an exemption. Proceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock by a Non-U.S. Holder effected through a U.S. office of a broker generally will be subject to 33 Table of Contents these information reporting and backup withholding rules unless such Non-U.S. Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person (generally by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E to the applicable withholding agent) or otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a Non-U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax liability if the required information is furnished by such Non-U.S. Holder on a timely basis to the IRS. 34 Table of Contents PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION The selling stockholder identified in this prospectus may offer, from time to time, shares of our common stock. We are registering such shares under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement between us and the selling stockholder. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholder. The selling stockholder and its successors, including its transferees, may sell all or a portion of the shares of our common stock directly to purchasers or through underwriters, broker-dealers or agents, who may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling stockholders or the purchasers of the shares. These discounts, concessions or commissions as to any particular underwriter, broker-dealer or agent may be in excess of those customary in the types of transactions involved. The shares of our common stock may be sold in one or more transactions on any national securities exchange or quotation service on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, in the over-the-counter market or in transactions otherwise than on these exchanges or systems or in the over-the-counter market and in one or more transactions at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected in transactions, which may involve crosses or block transactions. Additionally, the selling stockholder may enter into derivative transactions with third parties, or sell securities not covered by this prospectus to third parties in privately negotiated transactions. The selling stockholder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares:  on any national securities exchange or quotation service on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, including Nasdaq;  in the over-the-counter market;  in transactions otherwise than on these exchanges or services or in the over-the-counter market;  through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether the options are listed on an options exchange or otherwise;  ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;  an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;  a debt-for-equity exchange;  privately negotiated transactions;  settlement of short sales entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part;  broker-dealers may agree with the selling stockholder to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share;  a combination of any such methods of sale; and  any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. The selling stockholders may offer our common stock to the public through underwriting syndicates represented by managing underwriters or through underwriters without an underwriting syndicate. If underwriters are used for the sale of our common stock, the securities will be acquired by the underwriters for their own 35 Table of Contents account. The underwriters may resell the common stock in one or more transactions, including in negotiated transactions at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices determined at the time of sale. In connection with any such underwritten sale of common stock, underwriters may receive compensation from the selling stockholders, for whom they may act as agents, in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions. Underwriters may sell common stock to or through dealers, and the dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the underwriters or commissions from the purchasers for whom they may act as agents. Such compensation may be in excess of customary discounts, concessions or commissions. If underwriters are used for the sale of our common stock, to the extent required by law, the names of the underwriters will be set forth in the prospectus or prospectus supplement used by the underwriters to sell those securities. The selling stockholders may use underwriters with whom we or the selling stockholders have a material relationship. We will describe the nature of such relationship in any applicable prospectus supplement naming the underwriter or underwriters. If underwriters are used for the sale of our common stock, unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus or prospectus supplement relating to a particular offering of common stock, the obligations of any underwriters to purchase the securities will be subject to customary conditions precedent, and the underwriters will be obligated to purchase all of the securities offered if any of the securities are purchased. If underwriters are used for the sale of our common stock, in connection with such offering, the underwriters may advise us that they may engage in stabilizing transactions, which involves making bids for, purchasing and selling shares of common stock in the open market for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the common stock while this offering is in progress. These stabilizing transactions may include making short sales of the common stock, which involves the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares of common stock than they are required to purchase in this offering, and purchasing shares of common stock on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales may be covered shorts, which are short positions in an amount not greater than the underwriters option to purchase additional shares referred to above, or may be naked shorts, which are short positions in excess of that amount. The underwriters may close out any covered short position either by exercising their option to purchase additional shares, in whole or in part, or by purchasing shares in the open market. In making this determination, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market compared to the price at which the underwriters may purchase shares through the option to purchase additional shares. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering. To the extent that the underwriters create a naked short position, they will purchase shares in the open market to cover the position. The anti-manipulation rules of Regulation M under the Exchange Act may apply to sales of the shares of our common stock pursuant to this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement and to the activities of the selling stockholder. In addition, we will make copies of this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement available to the selling stockholder for the purpose of satisfying the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. To the extent applicable, Regulation M may also restrict the ability of any person engaged in the distribution of the common stock to engage in market-making activities with respect to the common stock. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the common stock and the ability of any person or entity to engage in market-making activities with respect to the common stock. In addition, any securities that qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 or Regulation S under the Securities Act or under Section 4(1) under the Securities Act may be sold under such rules rather than pursuant to this prospectus or a prospectus supplement. 36 Table of Contents The selling stockholder may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers, which may in turn engage in short sales of the shares of our common stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The selling stockholder may also sell short the shares and deliver common stock to close out short positions, or loan or pledge the shares to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these shares. The selling stockholder may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities that require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement. The selling stockholder also may transfer and donate the shares in other circumstances in which case the transferees, donees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement. The aggregate proceeds to the selling stockholder from the sale of the shares of our common stock will be the purchase price of the shares less discounts and commissions, if any. If the selling stockholder disposes of the shares of our common stock through a debt-for-equity exchange, it is expected that the selling stockholder and the debt exchange parties will enter into an exchange agreement. Under the exchange agreement, subject to certain conditions, the debt exchange parties, as principals for their own accounts, will exchange debt obligations of the selling stockholder held by the debt exchange parties for shares of our common stock held by the selling stockholder. The amount of indebtedness of the selling stockholder owned by the debt exchange parties is expected to be sufficient to acquire all of the shares of our common stock to be sold. Under U.S. federal securities laws, the debt exchange parties will be deemed to be the selling stockholders and underwriters with respect to any shares of common stock that they acquire in connection with a debt-for-equity exchange and sell in an offering in connection therewith. In the event that the selling stockholders are offering shares for sale in connection with a debt-for-equity exchange, MetLife may also be deemed a selling stockholder in such offering solely for U.S. federal securities laws purposes. In offering the shares of our common stock covered by this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement, the selling stockholder and any broker-dealers who execute sales for the selling stockholder may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. Any profits realized by the selling stockholder and the compensation of any broker-dealer may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions. Selling stockholders who are underwriters within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act and may be subject to certain statutory and regulatory liabilities, including liabilities imposed pursuant to Sections 11, 12 and 17 of the Securities Act and Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act. In order to comply with the securities laws of certain states, if applicable, the shares of our common stock must be sold in such jurisdictions only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. In addition, in certain states the shares may not be sold unless the shares are registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with. There can be no assurance that the selling stockholder will sell any or all of the common stock registered pursuant to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. At the time a particular offering of the shares is made, a prospectus supplement, if required, will be distributed, which will set forth the name of the selling stockholder, the aggregate amount of shares being offered by the selling stockholder and the terms of the offering, including, to the extent required, (1) the name or names of any underwriters, broker-dealers or agents, (2) any discounts, commissions and other terms constituting compensation from the selling stockholder and (3) any discounts, commissions or concessions allowed or reallowed to be paid to broker-dealers. 37 Table of Contents Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we have agreed to indemnify the selling stockholder against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the Securities Act. Agents and underwriters will be entitled to indemnification by us and the selling stockholder against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribution with respect to payments which the agents or underwriters may be required to make in respect thereof. Agents and underwriters and their respective affiliates may engage in transactions with, or perform services for us in the ordinary course of business for which they may receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. The estimated offering expenses payable by the selling stockholder, in addition to any underwriting discounts and commissions that will be paid by the selling stockholder, will be described in any applicable prospectus supplement. 38 Table of Contents VALIDITY OF COMMON STOCK Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, New York, New York will pass upon the validity of the shares of common stock offered in this prospectus.

Common Stock Table of Contents PART II INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS Item 13. Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution. The expenses in connection with the offering described in this registration statement, payable by the selling stockholder, will be as follows. All amounts shown are estimates except for the SEC registration fee and the FINRA filing fee. SEC registration fee $ 134,541 FINRA filing fee $ 162,597 Accounting fees and expenses $ 100,000 Printing fees and expenses $ 100,000 Legal fees and expenses $ 650,000 Miscellaneous $ 52,862 Total $ 1,200,000 Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse) is incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware. Section 102(b)(7) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, permits a Delaware corporation to include a provision in its certificate of incorporation eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. This provision, however, may not eliminate or limit a directors liability (1) for breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. The amended and restated certificate of incorporation of Brighthouse contains such a provision. Section 145(a) of the DGCL provides that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the persons conduct was unlawful. Section 145(b) of the DGCL provides that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action II-1 Table of Contents or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all of the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. Section 145(c) of the DGCL provides that to the extent that a present or former director or officer of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 145 of the DGCL, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. Section 145(e) of the DGCL permits a Delaware corporation to advance litigation expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by present and former directors and officers prior to the final disposition of the relevant proceedings. The advancement of expenses to a present director or officer is conditioned upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay the advancement if it is ultimately determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation. Advancement to former officers and directors may be conditioned upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation may deem appropriate. Section 145(g) of the DGCL specifically allows a Delaware corporation to purchase liability insurance on behalf of its directors and officers and to insure against potential liability of such directors and officers regardless of whether the corporation would have the power to indemnify such directors and officers under Section 145 of the DGCL. The amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws of Brighthouse authorize the corporation, to indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law. The foregoing summaries are necessarily subject to the complete text of the DGCL and Brighthouses amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws. Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities. On September 28, 2016, we issued 100,000 shares of our common stock to MetLife for aggregate consideration of $1,000 in a transaction exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. We did not register the issuance of such shares under the Securities Act because such issuance did not constitute a public offering. On June 22, 2017, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.700% senior notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes) and $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.700% senior notes due 2047 (the 2047 Notes and, together with the 2027 Notes, the Senior Notes) to third party investors. The sales and issuances of the Senior Notes were made under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. Net proceeds to the registrant from the sale of the Senior Notes, after deduction of the discount, were $2.964 million. Net proceeds were used to pay a dividend to MetLife and for general corporate purposes. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC acted as representatives of the initial purchasers. On May 1, 2018, we completed the exchange offer of 99.67% of the 2027 Notes and 99.98% of the 2047 Notes for like principal amounts of new 3.700% senior notes due 2027 and new 4.700% senior notes due 2047, which have been registered under the Securities Act. On August 3, 2017, we issued 119,673,106 shares of common stock to MetLife in exchange for the transfer by MetLife of 100 common units of Brighthouse Holdings, LLC, representing all of the common units of Brighthouse Holdings, LLC, to us, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, dated as of July 27, 2017, among us, MetLife and Brighthouse Holdings, LLC. The transaction was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. We did not register the issuance of such shares under the Securities Act because such issuance did not constitute a public offering. II-2 Table of Contents Item 16.

Item 17. Undertakings. (a) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of a prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement. (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (b) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that: (1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b) (1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. II-3 Table of Contents (2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (c) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
