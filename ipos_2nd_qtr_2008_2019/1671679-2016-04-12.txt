PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS SUBJECT TO COMPLETION DATED ________________, 2016 Up to 5,000,000 Common Shares NEXT GEN WATER CORPORATION LTD. This prospectus covers the resale of: · 5,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share; This is the initial offering of common stock of Next Gen Water Corporation Ltd. and no public market currently exists for the securities being offered.

There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the offering to proceed, and we will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered shares. The offering is being conducted on a self-underwritten, best efforts basis, which means our President, Tom Moore, will attempt to sell the shares.

Overview We were incorporated on September 26, 2014 in Nevada as Jobswipe Corporation (Jobswipe). Until closing of the Acquisition (described below), Jobswipe operated solely as a proposed next generation tool that would simplify the pairing of would be employers with interested applicants through a secure, easy to use smartphone application. On September 17, 2015, we changed our corporate name to Next Gen Water Corporation Ltd. (Next Gen) from Jobswipe Corporation, to reflect the new direction of the Company. Next Gen is a developer, manufacturer and distributor of Atmospheric Water Harvester (AWH) technology. This technology provides a cost-effective solution to the global shortage of drinking water by extracting water from air and turning it into clean, healthy drinking water. The technology transforms available water vapor from air humidity into great tasting drinking water by using refrigeration technology that condenses water vapor. AWH machines continuously simulate the dew point allowing water to be collected even in relatively low-humidity conditions. Next Gen has acquired an inventory of various prototype atmospheric water harvester machines which it intends to mass produce for marketing and distribution. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations (See "Description of Business" and "Use of Proceeds"). To implement our plan of operations we require a minimum of $42,000 for the next twelve months as described in our Plan of Operations. There is no assurance that we will generate any revenue in the first 12 months after completion our offering or ever generate any revenue. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at FT B Blk. 1 Victoria Ctr., 15 Watson Road, North Point, Hong Kong. Our phone number is 85225702177. From inception (September 26 , 2014) until the date of this filing, we have had limited operating activities. Our audited financial statements from inception (September 26, 2014) through August 31, 2015, reports no revenue and a net loss of $58,784. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Gillespie & Associates, PLLC has issued an audit opinion for Next Gen Water Corporation Ltd. which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, we have developed our business plan and developed business-model of our atmospheric water harvesting machines. 1 As of the date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our securities will ever develop. Proceeds from this offering are required for us to proceed with our business plan over the next twelve months. We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the SEC. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $42,000, our business may fail. Since we are presently in the development stage of our business, we can provide no assurance that we will successfully sell any products or services related to our planned activities.

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW AND THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHEN AND IF WE TRADE AT A LATER DATE, COULD DECLINE DUE TO ANY OF THESE RISKS, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. Risks Related to our Business BECAUSE OUR AUDITORS HAVE RAISED A GOING CONCERN, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY THAT WE WILL CONTINUE OPERATIONS IN WHICH CASE YOU COULD LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment. WE MAY CONTINUE TO LOSE MONEY AND IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR BUSINESS. We are company with limited operations, have incurred expenses and have losses. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, which may not occur. We expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. We expect to have quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenues, expenses, losses and cash flow, some of which could be significant. Results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, some beyond our control, including regulatory actions, market acceptance of our products and services, new products and service introductions, and competition. WE ARE SOLELY DEPENDENT UPON THE FUNDS TO BE RAISED IN THIS OFFERING TO START OUR BUSINESS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE REVENUES AND PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. Our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations. We need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the "Plan of Operation" section of this prospectus. As of November 30, 2015, we had cash in the amount of $491,inventory in the amount of $16,296, intangible assets of $10,000 and liabilities of $11,500. As of this date, we have no income and just recently started our operation. The proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations. We need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year. If we are not able to raise this amount, or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from our directors , who have informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees, including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses. However, our directors have no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. After one year we may need additional financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. If we are successful in raising the funds from this offering, we plan to commence activities to continue our operations. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations. 4 WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE COMMENCED LIMITED OPERATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We were incorporated on September 26, 2014 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We have commenced limited business operations. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. We anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail. WE HAVE LIMITED SALES AND MARKETING EXPERIENCE,WHICH INCREASES THE RISK THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL. We have limited experience in the sales and marketing of atmospheric water harvesting machines. Our future success will depend, among other factors, upon whether our products can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire, adopt, and continue to use them. There can be no assurance that our atmospheric water harvesting machines will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our products . WE ARE IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GAIN MARKET SHARE WHICH COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. The business of marketing and selling atmospheric water harvesting machines is very competitive. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and we face competitive pressures from companies entering this market.. There are a number of successful companies that have this technology, which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful. These competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base, and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service. If we cannot gain enough market share, our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO USE THEIR FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO DOMINATE THE MARKET, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES. Some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized. They could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market, which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs. Their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development, as well as marketing and production. We might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE FUTURE CUSTOMERS. EVEN IF WE OBTAIN CUSTOMERS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE A PROFIT. IF THAT OCCURS WE WILL HAVE TO CEASE OPERATIONS. We have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract future customers. Even if we obtain new customers for our service, there is no guarantee that we will make a profit. If we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably, we will have to suspend or cease operations. 5 BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL, OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. IF WE DO NOT MAKE A PROFIT, WE WILL SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS. Due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers. Because we will be limiting our marketing activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to suspend or cease operations. WE DEPEND TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ON CERTAIN KEY PERSON, THE LOSS OF WHOM MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPANY. Currently, we have only two employees who are our officers and directors. We depend entirely on the directors for all of our operations. The loss of either director would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail. The directors has not been compensated for his services since our incorporation, and it is highly unlikely that he will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues. There is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. The loss of our directors services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business. In the event of the loss of services of such personnel, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel. We do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officers and directors. We do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with him or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future. BECAUSE OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS WILL ONLY BE DEVOTING LIMITED TIME TO OUR OPERATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SPORADIC WHICH MAY RESULT IN PERIODIC INTERRUPTIONS OR SUSPENSIONS OF OPERATIONS. THIS ACTIVITY COULD PREVENT US FROM ATTRACTING ENOUGH CUSTOMERS AND RESULT IN A LACK OF REVENUES WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO CEASE OPERATIONS. Tom Moore and Ka Tin Foo, our officers and directors will only be devoting limited time to our operations. They will be devoting approximately 20 hours a week each to our operations. Because our officers and directors will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations. OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE NO EXPERIENCE MANAGING A PUBLIC COMPANY WHICH IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROL AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. We have never operated as a public company. Tom Moore and Ka Tin Foo, our officers and directors have no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations, which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected. OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS DO NOT RESIDE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE U.S. STOCKHOLDERS WOULD FACE DIFFICULTY IN EFFECTING SERVICE OF PROCESS AGAINST OUR OFFICERS. Our executive officers do not reside in the United States. The U.S. stockholders would face difficulty in: 6 * effecting service of process within the United States on our officers; * enforcing judgments obtained in U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against the officers; * enforcing judgments of U.S. courts based on civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws in foreign courts against our officers; and * bringing an original action in foreign courts to enforce liabilities based on the U.S. federal securities laws against our officers. WE ARE AN "EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY" UNDER THE JOBS ACT, AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN IF THE REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES WILL MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS. We qualify as an "emerging growth company" under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: - have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; - provide an auditor attestation with respect to management's report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; - comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); - submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as "say-on-pay" and "say-on-frequency;" and - disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive's compensation to median employee compensation. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. We will remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. Until such time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING BECAUSE THE OFFERING PRICE HAS BEEN ARBITRARILY SET BY THE COMPANY, YOU MAY NOT REALIZE A RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT UPON RESALE OF YOUR SHARES. The offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the Company's shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective financial criteria. Additionally, as the Company was formed on September 26, 2014, and has only a limited operating history with no earnings, the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings, and no investment banker, appraiser, or other independent third party, has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares, as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock. 7 WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES. This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to sell our shares through our President, who will receive no commissions. There is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless he is successful in receiving the proceeds in the amount of $250,000 from this offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan. THE REGULATION OF PENNY STOCKS BY THE SEC AND FINRA MAY DISCOURAGE THE TRADABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES. The shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. OUR PRESIDENT, TOM MOORE DOES NOT HAVE ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE OFFERING AND SELLING SECURITIES, AND OUR OFFERING DOES NOT REQUIRE A MIMIMUM AMOUNT TO BE RAISED. AS A RESULT OF THIS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ENOUGH FUNDS TO COMMENCE AND SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. Tom Moore does not have any experience conducting a securities offering. Consequently, we may not be able to raise any funds successfully. Also, the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised. If we are not able to raise sufficient funds, we may not be able to fund our operations as planned, and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to successfully conduct a best-effort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us. DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING. We are not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board ("OTCBB"). The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities. The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. Market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings between Next Gen and anyone acting on our behalf, with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment. 8 WE WILL INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE. WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL. The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration cost, we will have to utilize funds from our officers and directors, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. Our Directors verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. After the effective date of this prospectus, we will be required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, or other information with the SEC as provided by the Securities Exchange Act. We will voluntarily continue reporting in the absence of an SEC reporting obligation. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. The costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next 12 month will be approximately $10,000. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. Also, if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. THE COMPANY'S INVESTORS MAY SUFFER FUTURE DILUTION DUE TO ISSUANCES OF SHARES FOR VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS IN THE FUTURE. Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 750,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which Nil shares are currently issued and outstanding. If we sell the 5,000,000 shares being offered in this offering, we would have 9,422,000 shares issued and outstanding. As discussed in the "Dilution" section below, the issuance of the shares of common stock described in this prospectus will result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our existing shareholders. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. We use words such as "anticipate", "believe", "plan", "expect", "future", "intend", and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us as described in the "Risk Factors" section and elsewhere in this prospectus. USE OF PROCEEDS Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and "best-efforts" basis: no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per share is $0.05. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $100,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will receive any proceeds from the offering. 9 If 25% If 50% If 75% If 100% shares sold shares sold shares sold shares sold Description ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- GROSS PROCEEDS 62,500 125,000 187,500 250,000 Offering expenses 8,000 8,000 8,000 8,000 NET PROCEEDS 54,500 117,000 179,500 242,000 Office 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 Water machine manufacturing 35,500 90,000 139,500 204,000 Marketing Campaign 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 Salesperson 5,000 10,000 20,000 20,000 SEC reporting and compliance 10,000 10,000 10,000 10,000 The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, our directors have verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the registration process. The Directors verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. The Directors will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by our directors. The Directors will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the ation. DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities. DILUTION Dilution represents the difference between the Offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this Offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the Offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholder. The historical net tangible book value as of November 30, 2015 was $Nil or approximately $.001 per share. Historical net tangible book value per share of common stock is equal to our total tangible assets less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of November 30, 2015. The following table sets forth as of November 30, 2015, the number of shares of common stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our existing stockholders and by new investors in this offering if new investors purchase 50%, 75% or 100% of the offering, after deduction of offering expenses payable by us, assuming a purchase price in this offering of $0.05 per share of common stock. 10 Percent of Shares Sold from Maximum Offering Available 25% 50% 75% 100% Offering price per share $0.05 $0.05 $0.05 $0.05 Post offering net tangible book value 59,787 122,287 184,787 247,287 Post offering net tangible book value per share 0.0105 0.0177 0.0226 0.0262 Pre-offering net tangible book value per share 0.0012 0.0012 0.0012 0.0012 Increase (Decrease) in net tangible book value per share after offering 0.0093 0.0158 0.0014 0.0250 Dilution per share 0.0015 0.0019 0.0022 0.0026 % dilution 3% 3.98% 4.0% 5.2% Capital contribution by purchasers of shares 62,500 125,000 187,500 250,000 Capital Contribution by existing stockholder 66,440 66,440 66,440 66,440 Percentage capital contributions by purchasers of shares 48.47% 65.29% 73.84% 79.00% Percentage capital contributions by existing shareholders 51.53% 34.71% 26.16% 21.00% Gross offering proceeds 62,500 125,000 187,500 250,000 Anticipated net offering proceeds 54,500 42,000 67,000 92,000 Number of shares after offering held by public investors 1,250,000 2,500,000 3,750,000 5,000,000 Total shares issued and outstanding 5,672,000 6,922,000 8,172,000 9,422,000 Purchasers of shares percentage of ownership after offering 22.04% 36.12% 45.89% 53.07% Existing stockholders percentage of ownership after offering 77.96% 63.88% 54.11% 46.93% MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this prospectus. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the "Risk Factors" section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. We qualify as an "emerging growth company" under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: * have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; * provide an auditor attestation with respect to management's report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; * comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); * submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as "say-on-pay" and "say-on-frequency;" and * disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO's compensation to median employee compensation. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 11 We will remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which could occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by on-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. Our cash balance was $491 as of November 30, 2015. We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from our directors, who have informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. As of November 30, 2015, our directors have advanced to us $11,500. Our directors, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period, we require a minimum of $42,000 of funding from this offering. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at FT B Blk. 1 Victoria Ctr., 15 Watson Road, North Point, Hong Kong. Our phone number is 85225702177. We are a development stage company and we have generated no revenue to date. Our full business plan entails activities described in the Plan of Operation section below. Long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering may be required to expand our business. The exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our development and expansion. We do not currently have planned our expansion, and we have not decided yet on the scale of our development and expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing. If e do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding at the end of the twelve month period described in our "Plan of operation" below to maintain a reporting status. Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage. To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. If we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering. If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Even if we raise $100,000 from this offering, we may need more funds for ongoing business operations after the first year, and would have to obtain additional funding. PLAN OF OPERATION We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 26, 2014. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets. We are a development stage company that has not generated any revenue and just recently started our operations. If we are unable to successfully find clients who will use our service, we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering. We intend to spend money on the acquisition of atmospheric water harvesting machines in order to develop our business. Further we do not expect significant changes in the number of employees. 12 Our plan of operations is as follows: COMPLETE OUR PUBLIC OFFERING We expect to complete our public offering within 180 days after the effectiveness of our registration statement by the Securities and Exchange Commissions. We intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital during this period. Our operations will be limited due to the limited amount of funds on hand. Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to profitably sell our services. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $42,000 (If 50% of the shares sold), our business may fail. Our plan of operations following the completion is as follows: OFFICE (1st-3 months) $2,000-$5,000 Minimum requirements of our company to continue operations are, at least, obtaining the following office equipment: a telephone, a fax, a multifunction printer, stationery and furniture. We expect the cost to be equal to $2,000. We plan to buy the office equipment mentioned above in case we manage to sell 50% of the shares offered. In case we sell 75% of the shares offered we intend to buy additional equipment with advanced features with estimated price of $4,000. Provided that we sell all of the shares offered, we might be able to buy more advanced equipment to carry out everyday operations more successfully; therefore the office set up costs are estimated to be equal to $5,000. WATER MACHINE PURCHASES (1st-3 months) $54,500 -$242,000 The company was organized to engage in developing the next generation water solutions in order to address the global shortage of drinking water by extracting water from air and turning it into clean, healthy drinking water. We plan to buy a variety of atmospheric water harvesting machines from an Korean manufacturer. The company is looking to buy atmospheric water harvesting machines for both home and office use and commercial and industrial use. The production capacity of these machines will range between 8 gallons per day for the home and office units and up to 5000 gallons per day for the commercial and industrial units. The cost of these units ranges between $600.00 for the smallest home and office unit to $5,200.00 for the largest industrial unit. MARKETING CAMPAIGN (3rd-12th months) $2,000-$8,000 The companys marketing campaign focuses on raising awareness about the environmental and economic benefits of using atmospheric water harvesting machines. Environmental and economic benefits will be outlined within the brand of the company, thus allowing politicians, activists and business leader to pay serious attention to this alternative and connecting the company as the ultimate solution to this crisis. Private sector markets will become aware of the economic savings afforded by atmospheric water harvesting machines, while the public sector will be made aware of the efficiencies of this solution over others that are used now. The companys marketing will focus on global public relations, targeted networking, focused advertising and water related trade shows. In each of these venues they will target the both the public project and private sector markets along with distributors and retailers. SALESPERSON (6th-12th months) $5,000-$30,000 The company will also look for an independent sales agent to serve our markets. In order to develop a strong network of contacts, the company will offer an excellent margin system to sales agents selling our units. The margin will be similar to the margin that offered by other water solutions, so for every sale that the rep makes, he/she makes a commission as well as revenue from the installation. This system provides the rep with an incentive to recommend the company over the competition. ESTIMATED EXPENSES FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTH PERIOD The following provides an overview of our estimated expenses to fund our plan of operation over the next twelve months. If 25% If 50% If 75% If 100% shares sold shares sold shares sold shares sold Description ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- GROSS PROCEEDS 62,500 125,000 187,500 250,000 Offering expenses 8,000 8,000 8,000 8,000 NET PROCEEDS 54,500 117,000 179,500 242,000 Office 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 Water machine manufacturing 35,500 90,000 139,500 204,000 Marketing Campaign 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 Salesperson 5,000 10,000 20,000 20,000 SEC reporting and compliance 10,000 10,000 10,000 10,000 13 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in the start-up stage of operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholder. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM INCEPTION ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2014 TO NOVEMBER 30, 2015 During the period we incorporated the company, prepared a business plan. Our loss since inception is $73,153. We have just recently started our business operations, however, will not start significant operations until we have completed this offering. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of November 30, 2015, the Company had $491 cash, inventory of $16,296, intangible assets of $10,000 and our liabilities were $11,500. The available capital reserves of the Company are not sufficient for the Company to remain operational. We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the SEC. Since inception, we have sold 4,422,000 shares of common stock: a. 2,500,000 restricted common shares at $0.02 per share for a value of $50,000 pursuant to a research and development agreement dated September 30, 2014. b. 500,000 restricted common shares at $0.02 per share for a value of $10,000 pursuant to real property assignment agreement dated October 23, 2015. c. 600,000 restricted common shares at $0.02 per share for a value of $12,000 to two directors and one advisory board member pursuant to services rendered. d. 822,000 restricted common shares at $0.02 per share for proceeds of $16,440 pursuant to three private placement subscription agreements dated in October 2015. 14 We are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operations. We will have to utilize funds from our directors, who have verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process if offering proceeds are less than registration costs. However, the directors have no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. Our directors verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. To proceed with our operations within 12 months, we need a minimum of $42,000. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our 12 month financial requirements. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operations. In the long term we may need additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Obtaining additional funding will be subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions, investor acceptance of our business plan and initial results from our business operations. These factors may impact the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing available to us. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. Our auditors have issued a "going concern" opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The Company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $10,000. The Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Company's management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations. Should the Company fail to raise a minimum of $42,000 under this offering the Company would be forced to scale back or abandon the implementation of its 12-month plan of operations. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Next Gen is a developer, manufacturer and distributor of Atmospheric Water Harvester (AWH) technology. This technology provides a cost-effective solution to the global shortage of drinking water by extracting water from air and turning it into clean, healthy drinking water. The technology transforms available water vapor from air humidity into great tasting drinking water by using refrigeration technology that condenses water vapor. AWH machines continuously simulate the dew point allowing water to be collected even in relatively low-humidity conditions. Next Gen has acquired an inventory of various prototype atmospheric water harvester machines which it intends to mass produce for marketing and distribution. The selection of home and office machines to be sold are the Next Gen 3000 and Next Gen X,Y & Z. The selection of commercial and industrial machines sold are the Next Gen 100, 200, 500, 1200, 3000 & 5000. The home and office models can produce up to 30 liters of drinking water per day based on relative humidity, while the commercial and industrial models can produce up to 5,000 liters of drinking water per day, based on relative humidity and size of the machine. Both water harvesting machines have the price and quality advantage that makes the machines economical to operate in any environment and superior to all other competitors in this innovative yet effective method of creating much needed clean water. The cost of operating these machines to produce water range from $.008 to $.025 per liter 15 Our principal office address is located FT B Blk. 1 Victoria Ctr., 15 Watson Road, North Point, Hong Kong. Our phone number is 85225702177. Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations. We are a development stage company and have not earned any revenue. It is likely that we will not be able to achieve profitability and would be forced to cease operations due to the lack of funding. BUSINESS Next Gen is in the business of acquiring innovative clean tech technologies and adding value to them through marketing and distribution efficiencies. The company is engaged in developing these next generation water solutions to extract water from air and turn it into clean, healthy drinking water. The technology transforms available water vapor from air humidity into great tasting drinking water by using refrigeration technology that condenses water vapor. Next Gens atmospheric water harvesting machines continuously simulate the dew point allowing water to be collected even in relatively low-humidity conditions. Air is drawn through a specially designed filter that removes dust and purifies the air. The condensed water is then collected and passed through a water treatment module with an ultraviolet reactor light to kill any bacteria. In the final stage, the water passes through a one micron sediment filter and once again through an ultraviolet reactor followed by a high quality carbon filter, which enhances the waters taste. In order to minimize our start-up costs, we will continue to outsource the manufacturing, marketing and set-up of our machines until the product demand warrants a more profitable method of producing the quantities needed to fulfill sales orders. Only at that point will we consider manufacturing the products ourselves. We are a company on the stage of development and have not earned any revenue. In case we don't achieve estimated level of profitability, the company will be forced to cease operations due to the lack of funding. Next Gen has entered into the following agreements from inception to November 30, 2015: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (Exhibit 10.1) The Company entered into a research and development technology agreement dated September 30, 2014 to participate in technology development research and development resulting in the commercialization of the results of this research in producing an innovative air to water harvesting machine that will produce varying amounts of cleaning drinking water per day. The terms of the agreement are for one year and the Company is required to pay $50,000 due and payable in equal instalments of $12,500, the first payment being due upon the effective date of October 1, 2014 (all payments made). The payments were made by a shareholder on behalf of the Company and the shareholder has elected to take restricted common shares in the Company in lieu of a cash repayment, these restricted common shares were issued at $0.02 per share to the shareholder or her designates. In accordance with accounting policies, the research and development costs were expensed in the year ended August 31, 2015. No further research and development costs were incurred in the three month period ending November 30, 2015. INTANGIBLE ASSET  ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT FOR AIR TO WATER MACHINES (Exhibit 10.2) On October 23, 2015, the Company signed an agreement with Asiatic Management Consultants Ltd. (Asiatic) for the acquisition of technology and other proprietary information of an Air to Water System for which three working prototype machines that have been delivered by the manufacturer.

The Next Gen 100, 200, 500, 1200, 3000 and 5,000 are the machines we acquired through the purchase of inventory. The keys to success for Next Gen in this business is an extremely precise marketing and implementation plan made up of: - Providing quality products that can be used in a variety of situations (commercial to disaster relief). - Utilizing next-generation technology in order to continually improve upon current production options, while differentiating ourselves from our competition. - Strong negotiation and sales skills, either dealing with charities, celebrities, governments, channel issues and/or barriers to entry, or solving problems with perceptions in order to penetrate our target markets. - Our global product line must be delivered on time, costs controlled, marketing budgets man-aged. There is a temptation to increase growth at the expense of profits; we will keep a close eye on this temptation in order to live up to our plan. - Sustaining controlled growth in order to manage start-up costs more efficiently. Next Gen desires to establish a platform to commercialize the Companys acquired technology and demonstrates the operational and financial viability of the Company. The goal is to fully exploit our technology by marketing and distributing atmospheric water generating products and filtration systems. Business Objectives 1. To become the premier vendor for water charities, governments and private sector organizations in the new and evolving Atmospheric Water Generating industry. 2. To reach profitability within one year of the company's 2016 product roll-out. 3. To develop additional profit centers to include e-commerce and franchised stores 18 Financial Objectives 1. Increase product sales to twelve million dollars annually by the end of the second year. 2. Bring gross margin up and maintain that high level by the third year. 3. Improve inventory turnover on an ongoing basis, until "just-in-time" inventory standard by the third year. 4. The company expects to have exponential sales growth once market acceptance and brand recognition is achieved. Marketing Objectives 1. Establish brand awareness for the Next Gen name and products. 2. Focus on 5 key global markets to increase market penetration and domination. 3. Expand target markets with controlled growth in both public and private sectors 4. Position ourselves as the leading emerging clean tech water company in the world. Financial Plan As an emerging company in an emerging and changing industry, we have intentionally designed a conservative plan, looking to ensure the achievement of our corporate goals along with a solid ROI to our investor/partner(s). We will of course revise our financial plan throughout the first year based on actual figures in sales, manufacturing costs, technological advances, personnel, office space, marketing costs, and so on. Our plan's success is also predicated on the following assumptions: - Securing money with investor(s)/partner who will bring added value to our company. - The acceptance of our machines(s) systems by the public, the business sector, water charities and governments. - The ability to attract strong management to our team as needed. - Managing growth and production costs so as to maintain projected margins and cash flow. - Staying ahead of technological advances in this field, and reacting to these changes in a timely and efficient manner. - Managing the 2015 roll-out with minimal personnel until steady growth necessitates hiring additional department management and support staff. - Partnering with strong original equipment manufacturer’s quickly in order to penetrate and dominate market share. - Partnering with industry leaders (such as BP, Four Seasons, Princess Cruise Lines.,) to assist in demonstrating the efficacy of our systems. - Success in marketing our products for brand awareness and positioning. Adjusting and adapting to the market trends within this new and emerging industry. COMPETITION The atmospheric water generator industry is relatively new and is becoming highly competitive.

There are no plans or arrangements to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the shares with a broker or dealer.

Tom Moore will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in reliance upon Rule 3a4-1, which sets forth those conditions, as noted herein, under which a person associated with an Issuer may participate in the offering of the Issuer's securities and not be deemed to be a broker-dealer: 1. Our officers and directors are not subject to a statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Act, at the time of his participation; and, 2. Our officers and directors will not be compensated in connection with his participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities; and 3.

Performing ministerial and clerical work involved in effecting any transaction. Our officers and directors do not intend to purchase any shares in this offering.

In the event a broker-dealer is retained by us to participate in the offering, we must file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement to disclose the arrangements with the broker-dealer, and that the broker-dealer will be acting as an underwriter and will be so named in the prospectus. 24 Additionally, FINRA must approve the terms of the underwriting compensation before the broker-dealer may participate in the offering. To the extent required under the Securities Act, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement will be filed disclosing the name of any broker-dealers, the number of shares of common stock involved, the price at which the common stock is to be sold, the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealers, where applicable, that such broker-dealers did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and other facts material to the transaction. We are subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under it, including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 and a distribution participant under Regulation M. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the common stock. All expenses of the registration statement including, but not limited to, legal, accounting, printing and mailing fees are and will be borne by us. PENNY STOCK REGULATIONS You should note that our stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock. PROCEDURES FOR SUBSCRIBING If you decide to subscribe for any shares in this offering, you must - execute and deliver a subscription agreement; and - deliver a check or certified funds to us for acceptance or rejection. All checks for subscriptions must be made payable to "Next Gen Water Corporation Ltd.."

INDEMNIFICATION Under our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the corporation, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any proceeding, including a lawsuit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in our best interest.

Ltd. We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Next Gen Water Corp. Ltd. as of August 31, 2015 and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the period from September 26, 2014 (inception) through August 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, subject to the condition noted in the following paragraph, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Next Gen Water Corp. Ltd. for the year ended August 31, 2015 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year for the period from September 26, 2014 (inception) through August 31, 2015 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note #1 to the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note #1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /S/ GILLESPIE & ASSOCIATES, PLLC Seattle, Washington March 14, 2016 F-2 NEXT GEN WATER CORPORATION LTD.

F-6 NEXT GEN WATER CORPORATION LTD. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AUGUST 31, 2015 NOTE 1  NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION Next Gen Water Corporation Ltd. was incorporated on September 26, 2014 in the State of Nevada as Jobswipe Corporation On September 17, 2015, the Company changed its name to Next Gen Water Corporation Ltd. In 2016, the Company filed a Registration Statement Form S1 to become a fully reporting Company on the OTC: BB. Since inception the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to establishing a new business. While operations have not commenced, the Company has generated expenses and no revenue from the limited efforts. The Company's activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the company's business plan. The Company has adopted an August 31 fiscal year end. Next Gen Water Corporation Ltd., is a developer, manufacturer and distributor of Atmospheric Water Harvester (AWH) technology. This technology provides a cost-effective solution to the global shortage of drinking water by extracting water from air and turning it into clean, healthy drinking water. The technology transforms available water vapor from air humidity into great tasting drinking water by using refrigeration technology that condenses water vapor. AWH machines continuously simulate the dew point allowing water to be collected even in relatively low-humidity conditions. Going concern These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company's financial statements as of August 31, 2015 been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred a cumulative net loss from inception (September 26, 2014) through August 31, 2015 of $58,784. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to there coverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. F-7 NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements are presented in United States dollars and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Use of Estimates and Assumptions Preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Concentration of Credit Risk Cash in bank accounts are at risk to the extent that they exceed U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation insured amounts. To minimize risk, the Company places its cash with high credit quality institutions. All cash is deposited in one prominent Canadian financial institution. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Company, using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. The fair value of financial instruments classified as current assets or liabilities, including cash, notes receivable, accounts payable, and amounts due to related parties approximate their carrying value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Start-Up Costs In accordance with ASC 720, "Start up Costs", the Company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up and organization of the Company. F-8 NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont.) Research and Development Costs Costs of research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding are expensed as incurred. Foreign Currency Translation The financial statements are presented in United States dollars. In accordance with ASC Topic 830 Foreign Currency Matters, foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated to their United States dollar equivalents using foreign exchange rates that prevailed at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the year. Related translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity, whereas gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in results of operations. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets that do not meet the criteria for recognition. In the event the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, the would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes. The Company follows the accounting guidance which provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized initially and in subsequent periods. Also included is guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Recent Accounting Pronouncements There have been no recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted by the Company which would have a material impact on our financial statements at August 31, 2015.

No shares have been issued from inception on September 26, 2014 to August 31, 2015. See Subsequent Events Note 7. NOTE 5  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS In support of the Company's efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note. Since September 26, 2014 (Inception) through August 31, 2015, the Company's President has invoiced the Company $8,250 to pay for operating expenses pursuant to an office and administration agreement dated October 1, 2014. As of August 31, 2015, the amount outstanding was $8,250. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured. Since September 26, 2014 (Inception) through August 31, 2015, a business associate has loaned the Company $450 to pay for start up costs. As of August 31, 2015, the amount outstanding was $450. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.

NOTE 6  INCOME TAXES The reconciliation of income tax benefit at the U.S. statutory rate of 34% for the period ended August 31, 2015 to the Company's effective tax rate is as follows: Income tax expense at statutory rate (19,987) Change in valuation allowance 19,987 --------- Income tax expense $ -- ===== F-10 NEXT GEN WATER CORPORATION LTD. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AUGUST 31, 2015 NOTE 6  INCOME TAXES (cont.) The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the Company's net deferred tax assets as of August 31, 2015 are as follows: Net Operating Loss (19,987) Valuation allowance 19,987 --------- Net deferred tax asset $ -- ===== The Company has approximately $58,700 of net operating losses ("NOL") carried forward to offset taxable income in future years which expire commencing in fiscal 2035. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. NOTE 7  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Management has evaluated subsequent material events through March 16, 2016 and noted the following transactions a. 2,500,000 restricted common shares at $0.02 per share for a value of $50,000 pursuant to a research and development agreement dated September 30, 2014. b. 500,000 restricted common shares at $0.02 per share for a value of $10,000 pursuant to real property assignment agreement dated October 23, 2015. c. 600,000 restricted common shares at $0.02 per share for a value of $12,000 to two directors and one advisory board member pursuant to services rendered. d. 822,000 restricted common shares at $0.02 per share for proceeds of $16,440 pursuant to three private placement subscription agreements dated in October 2015. .

In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim financial statements furnished herein include all adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim period presented. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of the Company's financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that the actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions that could have a material effect on the reported amounts of the Company's financial position and results of operations.

NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements are presented in United States dollars and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Intangible Assets Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350. This standard also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment The Company's intangible assets consist of the acquisition of technology and other proprietary information of an Air to Water System for which three working prototype machines have been delivered by the manufacturer. Upon evaluation of the prototype machines, the Company will confirm the Order of Mold and the manufacturer the Order of Engineering to manufacture a brand of sellable machines. The Company determined that the intangibles have indefinite useful lives and will be reviewed annually for impairment. (see Note 4). Start-Up Costs In accordance with ASC 720, "Start up Costs", the Company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up and organization of the Company.

Related translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity, whereas gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in results of operations. F-17 NEXT GEN WATER CORPORATION LTD. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 30, 2015 - Unaudited NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont.) Income Taxes The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the future benefit, or if the future deductibility is uncertain. Loss per Common Share Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options, using the treasury method. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. Inventory Inventories consist of merchandise held for sale in the ordinary course of business, including cost of freight and other miscellaneous acquisition costs, and are stated at the lower of cost, or market determined on the first-in-first-out basis. The Company records a write-down for inventories, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each period that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, market conditions, product life cycle status, product development plans and current sales levels. If future demand or market conditions for the Companys products are less favourable than forecasted or if unforeseen changes negatively affect the utility of the Companys inventory, it may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs are recorded. If actual market conditions are more favorable, the Company may have higher gross margins when products incorporating inventory that were previously written down are sold. Recent Accounting Pronouncements There have been no recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted by the Company which would have a material impact on our financial statements at November 30, 2015. NOTE 3  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT The Company entered into a research and development technology agreement dated September 30, 2014 to participate in technology development research and development resulting in the commercialization of the results of this research in producing an innovative air to water harvesting machine that will produce varying amounts of cleaning drinking water per day.
