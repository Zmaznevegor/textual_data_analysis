PROSPECTUS SUMMARY As used in this prospectus, references to the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” “BSHL” refer to Billion Suntincen Holding Limited, a Wyoming company, and its wholly owned first and second tier subsidiaries including Billion Faith International Bhd. a Malaysian company and its nine Malaysian subsidiaries identified herein, unless the context otherwise indicates. The following summary highlights selected information contained in this prospectus. Before making an investment decision, you should read the entire prospectus carefully, including the “Risk Factors” section, the financial statements, and the notes to the financial statements. OUR COMPANY Company Overview We were incorporated in the State of Wyoming on June 13, 2018. On June 25, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Billion Faith International Bhd., a Malaysian corporation (“Subsidiary”). The Subsidiary was incorporated in Malaysia on December 13, 2016 and the Subsidiary has nine wholly owned subsidiaries, six of which are operating entities. All the Company’s second tier subsidiaries were incorporated in Malaysia. 5 The Company develops and distributes innovative consumer products throughout Malaysia and China, offering a comprehensive line of premium-quality beauty and wellness solutions under its “Zuo Yan” brand. Most of our popular products are derived from the birds’ nest of the swallow bird, which are obtained from locations mainly in Borneo and nationally in Malaysia. Our principal office address is B-05 Plaza Taragon Kelana, Jalan SS6/6 Kelana Jaya, 47301 Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia. Our telephone number is (+60) 193159266 . We do not have a website. We commenced operations in Malaysia in January 2017. We recorded gross revenues of $349,756 and a comprehensive loss of $723,388 for the annual period ended December 31, 2018. We recorded gross revenues of $116,077 and a comprehensive loss of $203,767 for the three month period ended March 31, 2019. Our corporate structure is depicted below: Billion Suntincen Holdings Limited, a Wyoming company 100% owned Billion Faith International Bhd, a Malaysian company 100% owned CSBN (Sg Chua) Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian company CSBN Asset Management Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian company CSBN Gallery (PD) Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian company CSBN O2O Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian company CSBN Procurement Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian company CSBN Retail Chain Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian company Billion Faith Marketing Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian company CSBN (Setia Alam) Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian company CSBN (Sandakan) Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian company We qualify as an "emerging growth company" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Following this offering, we will continue to qualify as an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least $1 billion (as indexed for inflation), (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering under this prospectus, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt and (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to as the “Exchange Act”). We have elected to 6 use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. Under U.S. federal securities legislation, our common stock is known as a "penny stock." Penny stock is any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require that a broker or dealer approve a potential investor's account for transactions in penny stocks, and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve an investor's account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person, and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination. Brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the "penny stock" rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock. Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.

You should carefully consider the following known material risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this prospectus in evaluating our company and its business before purchasing shares of our company’s common stock. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks. Risk Factors Relating to Our Business WE HAVE LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND LIMITED BUSINESS GROWTH. Through our subsidiary, we have been operational since January 2017, therefore we have had limited operations which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and our prospects. In addition, to date, we have not experienced substantial growth in our business. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by a small operating company trying to expand its business enterprise and the highly competitive environment in which we will operate. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the business of the Company will grow in the future. Moreover, because of our limited operating history, it is difficult to extrapolate any meaningful projections about the Company's future. WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN ORDER TO GROW OUR BUSINESS. We do not have significant assets with which to expand our business. We intend to expand our business through retailers, wholesalers, exporters and commissioned agents. These additional expenditures are intended to be funded from cash on hand and, if necessary, third party sources, including the incurring of debt and/or the sale of additional equity securities. In addition to requiring additional financing to fund expansion, the Company may require additional financing to fund working capital and operating losses in the future should the need arise. The incurrence of debt creates additional financial leverage and therefore an increase in the financial risk of the Company's operations. The sale of additional equity securities will be dilutive to the interests of current equity holders. In addition, there can be no assurance that such additional financing, whether debt or equity, will be available to the Company or that it will be available on acceptable commercial terms. Any inability to secure such additional financing on appropriate terms could have a materially adverse impact on the business, financial condition and operating results of the Company. WE MAY FACE PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS. Due to the nature of our business, we may face claims for product liability. These claims may arise from the application or consumption of our products. We cannot provide assurances that product liability claims will not arise in the future. Moreover, litigation or adverse publicity resulting from these allegations could materially and adversely affect our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are liable. Currently we have no product liability insurance coverage, and even if there was such coverage, there would be no assurance that such coverage would be sufficient to properly protect us. Further, claims of this type, whether substantiated or not, may divert our financial and management resources from revenue generating activities and the business operation. Presently, we do not have insurance to cover any product liability claims. This lack of insurance may cause a material adverse impact on the Company if product liability claims arise. AS WE UNDERTAKE OUR BUSINESS, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH POTENTIAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION THAT MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. In Malaysia, the birds’ nest industry is regulated by Malaysian Veterinary Service Dept. Inspection and quarantine is regulated by Ministry of Agriculture & Agro-based Industry Malaysia. We have complied with all regulation required by the Malaysian government. However, we cannot predict whether new legislation may be enacted in any of our markets, and if enacted, whether we would be able to comply with such regulations. Therefore, certain risks exist with respect to our future operations as a result of potential future regulations in our existing markets. WE FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER BIRDNEST AND COSMECEUTICAL COMPANIES AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS WILL SUFFER IF WE FAIL TO 9 COMPETE EFFECTIVELY . We believe there are a few companies worldwide that specialize in cosmeceutical production of birds’ nest products. To our knowledge, there is one company in Malaysia producing similar quality, grade and pricing policy on birds’ nest products. This competitor has stronger financial and resources, such as sophisticated research capabilities and development staff than we do. BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR FUTURE REVENUE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND INCREASE OUR COSTS AND EXPENSES. Our operations could be subject to power shortages, telecommunications failures, wildfires, water shortages, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Although we intend to obtain some form of business interruption insurance in the future, there can be no assurance that we will secure adequate insurance coverage or that any such insurance coverage will be sufficient to protect our operations to significant potential liability in the future. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR PROCESSING TECHNIQUE AND RECIPE. Our technique in birds’ nest essence extraction and the process adopted in manufacturing are an essential asset of our business. To establish and protect our processing technique and recipe, we rely primarily upon a trade secrets, and to a lesser extent, contractual provisions with current and future employees. Resultantly, our efforts to protect our processing technique and recipe may not be sufficient or effective. If these measures do not protect our processing technique and recipe, third parties could use the Company’s processing technique and recipe, and its ability to compete in the market would be reduced significantly. In addition, we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our processing technique and recipe. Even if we do detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our processing technique and recipe. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert our management’s attention. In addition, our efforts may be met with defenses and counterclaims challenging the validity and enforceability of our processing technique and recipe or may result in a court determining that our processing technique and recipe rights are unenforceable. If we are unable to cost-effectively protect our processing technique and recipe rights, then our business could be harmed. WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO BE A PUBLIC COMPANY TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ABSORB SUCH COSTS. We may incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect these costs to approximate $50,000 per year, consisting of $25,000 in legal, $20,000 in audit and $5,000 for EDGAR filing and transfer agent fees. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We may not be able to cover these costs from our operations and may need to raise or borrow additional funds. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these newly applicable rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may 10 incur or the timing of such costs. In addition, we may not be able to absorb these costs of being a public company which will negatively affect our business operations. OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS MAY HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS AT SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE. The interests of our Officers and Directors may not be, at all times, the same as that of our other shareholders. Our Officers and Directors are not simply passive investors but are also executives of the Company, their interests as executives may, at times be adverse to those of passive investors. Where those conflicts exist, our shareholders will be dependent upon our directors exercising, in a manner fair to all of our shareholders, their fiduciary duties as officers or as member of the Company’s Board of Directors. Also, our directors will have the ability to control the outcome of most corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, including the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and amendments to our articles of incorporation. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us, which may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders. BECAUSE OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS MAY IN FUTURE HAVE OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, THERE IS A POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DEDICATE TO THE COMPANY. Currently our officers, who are also directors, have been working on promoting business for the Company. Some of these parties have outside business interests. A potential conflict of interest may arise in the future that may cause our business to fail, including conflicts of interest in allocating their time to our company and their other business interests. While our officers have verbally agreed to devote sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Company, we have no written arrangement with our officers regarding this matter. As a result, we may face conflicts between business decisions that they may have to make regarding our operations and that of their other business interests. BECAUSE OUR MANAGEMENT DOES NOT HAVE PRIOR EXPERIENCE RUNNING A PUBLIC COMPANY, WE MAY HAVE TO HIRE INDIVIDUALS OR SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS. Because our management has limited prior experience in running a public company, including the preparation of reports under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, we may have to hire additional experienced personnel to assist us with the preparation thereof. If we need the additional experienced personnel and we do not hire them, we could fail in our plan of operations and have to suspend operations or cease operations entirely. INDEPENDENT AUDIT COMMITTEE. Although the common stock is not listed on any national securities exchange, for purposes of independence we use the definition of independence applied by NASDAQ. Currently, we have no independent audit committee. The full board of directors functions as audit committee and is comprised of five directors, two of whom are considered to be "independent" in accordance with the requirements set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2). An independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance process, assessing our Company's processes relating to our risks and control environment, overseeing financial reporting, and evaluating internal and independent audit processes. The lack of an independent audit committee may prevent the board of directors from being independent from management in its judgments and decisions and its ability to pursue the responsibilities of an audit committee without undue influence. We may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified, independent directors, the management of the business could be compromised. An independent audit committee is required for listing on any national securities exchange; therefore until such time as we meet the audit committee independence requirements of a national securities exchange, we will be ineligible for listing on any national securities exchange. CROSS-BORDER OPERATIONS. As we plan to continue expanding our existing cross-border operations into existing and other markets, we will face risks associated with expanding into markets in which we have limited or no experience and in which our company may be less well-known. We may be unable to attract a sufficient number of customers and other participants, fail to anticipate 11 competitive conditions or face difficulties in operating effectively in these new markets. The expansion of our cross-border business will also expose us to risks relating to staffing and managing cross-border operations, increased costs to protect intellectual property, tariffs and other trade barriers, differing and potentially adverse tax consequences, increased and conflicting regulatory compliance requirements, lack of acceptance of our service offerings, challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences, exchange rate risk and political instability. Accordingly, any efforts we make to expand our cross-border operations may not be successful, which could limit our ability to grow our revenue, net income and profitability. RISKS RELATED TO DOING BUSINESS IN ASIA PACIFIC REGION. Changes in the political and economic policies of the local government may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and may result in our inability to sustain our growth and expansion strategies. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations are affected to a significant extent by economic, political and legal developments in Asia Pacific region. The Asia Pacific economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the extent of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. In addition, the government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The government also exercises significant control over economic growth by allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, regulating financial services and institutions and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. The local government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall economy, but may also have a negative effect on us. Our financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us. In addition, the government has implemented in the past certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity, which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and consequently have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. YOU MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES IN EFFECTING SERVICE OF LEGAL PROCESS, ENFORCING FOREIGN JUDGMENTS OR BRINGING ORIGINAL ACTIONS IN MALAYSIA BASED ON UNITED STATES OR OTHER FOREIGN LAWS AGAINST US OR OUR MANAGEMENT. Our operating subsidiary is incorporated in Malaysia and conducts substantially all of our operations in Asia Pacific. All of our executive officers and directors reside outside the United States and all of their assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for shareholders to bring an action against us or against these individuals in Malaysia in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the securities laws of the United States or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of Malaysia may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers. There is no statutory recognition in Malaysia of judgments obtained in the United States, although the courts of Malaysia will generally recognize and enforce a non-penal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against us and our directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors are to a large extent governed by the common law of Malaysia. The common law of Malaysia is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in Malaysia as well as from English common law, which provides persuasive, but not binding, authority in a court in Malaysia. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Malaysian law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in the United States. In particular, Malaysia has a less developed body of securities laws than the United States and provides significantly less protection to investors. As a result, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against us, our management, our directors or our major shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States. 12 Risks Related to Our Common Stock IF THE SELLING SHAREHOLDERS SELL A LARGE NUMBER OF SHARES ALL AT ONCE OR IN BLOCKS, THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR SHARES WOULD MOST LIKELY DECLINE. The Company is offering up to 30,296,967 shares of our common stock through this prospectus. Presently, no market exists for our common stock. However, should a market develop, shares sold at a price below the then current market price at which the common stock is quoted will cause that market price to decline. Moreover, the offer or sale of a large number of shares at any price may cause the market price to fall. The outstanding shares of common stock covered by this prospectus represent approximately 18.53% of the common shares outstanding as of the date of this prospectus. SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144 MAY REDUCE PRICES IN THAT MARKET BY A MATERIAL AMOUNT. A significant number of the outstanding shares of our common stock are “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. As restricted securities, those shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or pursuant to the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and as required under applicable state securities laws. Rule 144 provides in essence that an affiliate ( i.e. , an officer, director or control person) who has held restricted securities for a prescribed period may, under certain conditions, sell every three months, in brokerage transactions, a number of shares that does not exceed 1.0% of the issuer’s outstanding common stock. The alternative limitation on the number of shares that may be sold by an affiliate, which is related to the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to the sale is not available to stockholders of companies whose securities are not traded on an “automated quotation system”; because the OTCQB or OTC Pink is not such a system, market-based volume limitations are not available for holders of our securities selling under Rule 144. Pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144, there is no limit on the number of restricted securities that may be sold by a non-affiliate ( i.e ., a stockholder who has not been an officer, director or control person for at least 90 consecutive days before the date of the proposed sale) after the restricted securities have been held by the owner for a prescribed period, although there may be other limitations and/or criteria to satisfy. A sale pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any other exemption from the Securities Act, if available, or pursuant to registration of shares of our common stock held by our stockholders, may reduce the price of our common stock in any market that may develop. YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO LIQUIDATE YOUR INVESTMENT SINCE THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT A PUBLIC MARKET WILL DEVELOP FOR OUR COMMON STOCK OR THAT OUR COMMON STOCK WILL EVER BE APPROVED FOR TRADING ON A RECOGNIZED EXCHANGE. There is no established public trading market for our securities. Although we intend to be quoted on the OTC QB tier of OTC Markets in the United States, our shares are not and have not been quoted on any exchange or quotation system. We cannot assure you that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the FINRA, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved or that a regular trading market will develop or that if developed, will be sustained. In the absence of a trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate its investment, which will result in the loss of your investment. OUR COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO THE “PENNY STOCK” RULES OF THE SEC AND THE TRADING MARKET IN OUR SECURITIES IS LIMITED, WHICH MAKES TRANSACTIONS IN OUR STOCK CUMBERSOME AND MAY REDUCE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK. Under U.S. federal securities legislation, our common stock will constitute “penny stock”. Penny stock is any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require that a broker or dealer approve a potential investor’s account for transactions in penny stocks, and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve an investor’s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person, and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has 13 sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination. Brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the “penny stock” rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock. Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY ISSUE ADDITIONAL COMMON AND PREFERRED SHARES, WHICH WOULD REDUCE INVESTORS’ PERCENT OF OWNERSHIP AND MAY DILUTE OUR SHARE VALUE. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 300,000,000 shares of common stock. As of the date of this filing, the Company had 76,518,000 shares of common stock outstanding. Accordingly, we may issue up to an additional 223,482,000 shares of common stock. In addition, we have the right to issue 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock is known as “blank check” as the Board of Directors is authorized to set the rights, privileges and preference of the preferred stock. The future issuance of common stock and preferred may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common stock or preferred stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock. UPON EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT, WE WILL NOT BE A FULLY REPORTING COMPANY UNDER SECTION 12(G) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, RATHER WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 15(D) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT WHICH IS LESS RESTRICTIVE ON US AND OUR INSIDERS. In order for us to become a fully reporting company under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, we will have to file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A. If we do not become subject to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, we will be subject to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and as such we will not be required to comply with (i) the proxy statement requirements which means shareholders may have less notice of pending matters, and (ii) the Williams Act which requires disclosure of persons or groups that acquire 5% of a company’s publicly traded stock and also regulates tender offers. In addition, our officer, director and 10% stockholder will not be required to submit reports to the SEC on their stock ownership and stock trading activity. These reports include Form 3, 4 and 5. Therefore, as a shareholder, less information and disclosure concerning these matters will be available to you. WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY ANY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK, OUR STOCKHOLDERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A RETURN ON THEIR SHARES UNLESS THEY SELL THEM. We intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. There is no assurance that stockholders will be able to sell shares when desired. OUR COMMON STOCK PRICE IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHLY VOLATILE WHICH MAY SUBJECT US TO SECURITIES LITIGATION THEREBY DIVERTING OUR RESOURCES WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. The market price for our common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general and the market for health care product stocks. The following factors will add to our common stock price's volatility: 14 - fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us; - changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts; - changes in market valuations of similar companies; - changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt; - regulatory developments in Malaysia or other countries wherein we expect to conduct business; - litigation involving our company, our general industry or both; - investors’ general perception of us; and - changes in general economic, industry and market conditions. Many of these factors are beyond our control. These factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, plaintiffs have initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. In the future, we may be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management’s attention and resources. REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES MAY MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS. We qualify as an "emerging growth company" under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:  have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;  comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);  submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as "say-on-pay" and "say-on-frequency;" and  disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO's compensation to median employee compensation. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five full fiscal years, although if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any January 31 before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31, or if our annual revenues exceed $1 billion, we would cease to be an emerging growth company the following fiscal year, or if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately. Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently a "smaller reporting company," meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, nor a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company, and has a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. If we are 15 still considered a "smaller reporting company" at such time as we cease to be an "emerging growth company," we will be subject to increased disclosure requirements. However, the disclosure requirements will still be less than they would be if we were not considered either an "emerging growth company" or a "smaller reporting company." Specifically, similar to "emerging growth companies", "smaller reporting companies" are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to conduct say-on-pay and frequency votes until annual meetings occurring on or after January 21, 2015; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in its SEC filings due to its status as an "emerging growth company" or "smaller reporting company" may make us less attractive to investors given that it will be harder for investors to analyze the Company's results of operations and financial prospects and, as a result, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. USE OF PROCEEDS This prospectus relates to shares of our common stock that may be offered and sold from time to time by the selling stockholders. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the common shares being offered for sale by the selling security holders. DETERMINATION OF THE OFFERING PRICE As there is no established public market for our shares, we have arbitrarily determined the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to our shares and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective criteria of value. In addition, we have not consulted any investment banker, appraiser, or other independent third party concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares. The shares offered by this prospectus may be sold by the selling stockholders at $0.05 per share until the shares are quoted on the QB tier of OTC Markets or an exchange. Thereafter, they may sell in the open market at prevailing prices, through privately negotiated transactions or a combination of these methods. DILUTION The common stock to be sold by the selling shareholders is common stock that is currently issued. Accordingly, there will be no dilution to our existing shareholders. SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS The following table sets forth the shares beneficially owned, as of the date hereof, by the selling security holders prior to the offering by existing shareholders contemplated by this prospectus, the number of shares each selling security holder is offering by this prospectus and the number of shares which each would own beneficially if all such offered shares are sold. All expenses incurred with respect to the registration of the common stock will be borne by us, but we will not be obligated to pay any underwriting fees, discounts, commissions or other expenses incurred by the selling security holders in connection with the sale of such shares. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Under these rules, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security, or investment power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security. The person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities, and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which he or she may not have any pecuniary beneficial interest. Except as noted below, each person has sole voting and investment power. 16 The percentages below are calculated based on 76,518,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this filing. We do not have any outstanding options, warrants or other securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock.

In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, securities that are currently convertible or exercisable into shares of our common stock, or convertible or exercisable into common stocks within 60 days of the date hereof are deemed outstanding. Such shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Except as indicated in the footnotes to the following table, each shareholder named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares set forth opposite such shareholder’s name. The shares of common stock registered herein are outstanding as of the date of this prospectus. (2) Assumes that all securities registered will be sold. We may require the selling stockholders to suspend the sales of the securities offered by this prospectus upon the occurrence of any event that makes any statement in this prospectus, or the related registration statement, untrue in any material respect, or that requires the changing of the statements in these documents in order to make statements in those documents not misleading. We will file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement to reflect any such material changes to this prospectus. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS There is currently no public market for the Company’s securities. Once and if the Company’s business sufficiently grows, the Company may wish to cause the Company’s common stock to trade in one or more United States securities markets. The Company anticipates that it will take the steps required for such admission to quotation following the business combination or at some later time. At such time as it qualifies, the Company may choose to apply for quotation of its securities on the OTC Markets QB or Pink sheet tier. The OTC Markets QB and/or Pink Sheet tiers are a dealer-driven quotation service. Unlike the Nasdaq Stock Market, companies cannot directly apply to be quoted on the OTC Markets QB tier and/or Pink Sheet tiers, only market makers can initiate quotes, and quoted companies do not have to meet any quantitative financial requirements. Any equity security of a reporting company not listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market or on a national securities exchange is eligible. Securities outstanding and holders of record As of the date of this filing, there were approximately 119 holders of record for our common stock and 76,518,000 shares of our common stock outstanding. Dividends We have never paid dividends and do not intend to do so in the near future. Information respecting equity compensation plans None. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION The selling security holders may sell some or all of their shares at a fixed price of $0.05 per share until our shares are quoted on the OTC Markets QB and/or Pink Sheet tiers and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. Prior to being quoted on the OTC Pink, shareholders may sell their shares in private transactions to other individuals. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange, we will be filing to obtain a listing on the OTC Markets QB and/or Pink Sheet tiers soon after the effectiveness of this Registration Statement. In order to be quoted on the OTC Markets QB and/or Pink Sheet tiers, a market maker must file an application on 23 our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. There is no assurance that an active trading market for our shares will develop, or, if developed, that it will be sustained. In the absence of a trading market or an active trading market, investors may be unable to liquidate their investment or make any profit from the investment. After our common stock becomes eligible for trading on the OTC Markets QB and/or Pink Sheet tiers, the shares of common stock being offered for resale by this prospectus may be sold by the selling security holders by one or more of the following methods, without limitation:  ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker solicits purchasers;  privately negotiated transactions;  market sales (both long and short to the extent permitted under the federal securities laws);  at the market to or through market makers or into an existing market for the shares;  through transactions in options, swaps or other derivatives (whether exchange listed or otherwise); and  a combination of any of the aforementioned methods of sale. In the event of the transfer by any of the selling security holders of its shares of common stock to any pledgee, donee or other transferee, we will amend this prospectus and the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part by the filing of a post-effective amendment in order to have the pledgee, donee or other transferee in place of the selling security holder who has transferred his, her or its shares. In effecting sales, brokers and dealers engaged by the selling security holders may arrange for other brokers or dealers to participate. Brokers or dealers may receive commissions or discounts from a selling security holder or, if any of the broker-dealers act as an agent for the purchaser of such shares, from a purchaser in amounts to be negotiated which are not expected to exceed those customary in the types of transactions involved. Before our common stock becomes eligible for trading on the OTC Markets, broker-dealers may agree with a selling security holder to sell a specified number of the shares of common stock at a price per share of $0.05. After our common stock becomes eligible for trading on the OTC Markets, broker-dealers may agree with a selling security holder to sell a specified number of the shares of common stock at a stipulated price per share. Such an agreement may also require the broker-dealer to purchase as principal any unsold shares of common stock at the price required to fulfill the broker-dealer commitment to the selling security holder if such broker-dealer is unable to sell the shares on behalf of the selling security holder. Broker-dealers who acquire shares of common stock as principal may thereafter resell the shares of common stock from time to time in transactions which may involve block transactions and sales to and through other broker-dealers, including transactions of the nature described above. After our common stock becomes eligible for trading on the OTC Markets, such sales by a broker-dealer could be at prices and on terms then prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to the then-current market price or in negotiated transactions. In connection with such re-sales, the broker-dealer may pay to or receive from the purchasers of the shares commissions as described above. The selling security holders and any broker-dealers or agents that participate with the selling security holders in the sale of the shares of common stock may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with these sales. In that event, any commissions received by the broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares of common stock purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. From time to time, any of the selling security holders may pledge shares of common stock pursuant to the margin provisions of customer agreements with brokers. Upon a default by a selling security holder, their broker may offer and sell the pledged shares of common stock from time to time. After our common stock becomes eligible for trading on the OTC Markets QB and/or Pink Sheet tiers, upon a sale of the shares of common stock, the selling security holders intend to comply with the prospectus delivery requirements under the Securities Act by delivering a prospectus to each purchaser in the transaction. We intend to file any amendments or other necessary documents in 24 compliance with the Securities Act that may be required in the event any of the selling security holders defaults under any customer agreement with brokers. To the extent required under the Securities Act, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement will be filed disclosing the name of any broker-dealers, the number of shares of common stock involved, the price at which the shares of common stock is to be sold, the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealers, where applicable, that such broker-dealers did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and other facts material to the transaction. We and the selling security holders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under it, including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 and, insofar as a selling security holder is a distribution participant and we, under certain circumstances, may be a distribution participant, under Regulation M. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the shares of common stock. Any shares of common stock covered by this prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as amended, may be sold under Rule 144 rather than pursuant to this prospectus. Once sold under the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part, the shares of common stock will be freely tradable in the hands of persons other than our affiliates.

Edible Bird Nests and Usage in the Far East. Edible bird nests are bird nests built by wild swiftlet using solidified saliva, which are harvested then processed to be edible birds’ nest for human consumption. Swiftlets are tiny insectivorous birds found in the Far East. Edible bird nests are highly prized in the Chinese culture due to the limited supply from only a few tropical countries, and the supposedly high nutritional value and exquisite flavor. Birds’ nest soup is a delicacy in Chinese cuisine. The Chinese name for birds’ nest soup, yàn wō, translates literally as "swallow's nest". This soup has been consumed in China for over in excess of 1,000 years. According to Yun-Cheung Kong, a professor of biochemistry at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, swiftlet nests were first traded in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.). Sometime between the years 1368 and 1644, Admiral Cheng He introduced foreign nests to the imperial court of the Ming Dynasty. In the early seventeenth century, European observers describe birds’ nests as an unusual food in Indochina, and they reported the existence of a well-developed trade market of birds’ nests, most of them intended for China, at Batavia (now Jakarta), Indonesia. This evidence led to the view that the use of birds’ nests in China was first became widespread sometime between the mid-fifteenths to the early seventeenth century. 26 The most famous use of edible birds nest is birds’ nest soup, a delicacy in Chinese cuisine. In addition to their use in soup, edible birds’ nests can be used as an ingredient in many other dishes. They can be cooked with rice to produce birds’ nest congee or birds’ nest boiled rice, or they can be added to egg tarts and other desserts. A birds’ nest jelly can be made by placing the birds’ nest in a ceramic container with minimal water and sugar (or salt) and double steamed. Ready-to-eat birds’ nest jelly is available in jars as a commercial product. Edible bird nests are among the most expensive animal products consumed by humans with nests being sold recently at prices up to about US$2,000 per kilogram, depending on grading. In Hong Kong, a bowl of birds’ nest soup would cost from $30 to $100USD. The material is also used in traditional Chinese and Vietnamese medicines. The Chinese believe that birds nest consumption provides health benefits, such as aiding digestion, raising libido, alleviating asthma, improving focus, and an overall benefit to one’s immune system. Historically, the nests were harvested from caves, principally the enormous limestone caves at Gomantong and Niah in Borneo. With the escalation in demand, these sources have been supplanted since the late 1990s by purpose-built nesting houses. These nesting houses are normally found in urban areas near the sea, since the birds have a propensity to flock in such places. This has become an extraordinary industry, mainly based on a series of towns in the Indonesian province of North Sumatra, which have been completely transformed by the activity. In Malaysia, for example, there were about 900 swiftlet farms throughout the country prior to 1998. Today, there are over 60,000 swiftlet ranchers in Malaysia. Bird nests are mostly exported to the markets in Hong Kong, which has become the center of the world trade, though most of the final consumers are from mainland China. According to a recent medical research reported by Hong Kong Chinese University, the cell division enzyme and hormone of birds’ nest can promote reproduction and regeneration of human cells. It also helps promote one’s immune system and enhances body metabolism. In addition, studies by the Innovation Centre of Food Technology (MANIS) National University Malaysia (UKM) indicate that bird nest soup has the highest antioxidant and anti-hypertensive activities compared to chicken and fish (haruan) soups. Edible birds’ nest is highly palatable for the Asian due to its exquisite flavor. Birds’ nest is among the most expensive delicacies consumed by humans for over 400 years. Birds’ Nest is considered a super-food due to their high content of protein and essential amino acids while low in calories and fat. Edible bird nest is traditionally believed to provide health benefits, such as aiding digestion, raising libido, alleviating asthma and improving concentration.

We also use independent distributors to sell mostly bird nest extract products who sell to corporate clients, Chinese medicine pharmacies and other retailers. These marketing channels receive discounts or commissions ranging from 20-40% from our retail pricing. Our retail showroom is depicted below. Raw Materials and Manufacturing . Our primary raw material is birds’ nest which we source from licensed, third party swiftlet farmers located in Selangor and Sabah, Malaysia. Currently we have arrangements with approximately 50 swiftlet farmers which is sufficient to meet our current product demands. We will continue sourcing additional supply as our needs arise and we believe there is adequate supply from these existing farmers for our future needs. In addition to the birds nest supply, we source all of the other raw materials for our product line from third party suppliers. We believe there is sufficient supply from a variety of suppliers to meet our current and future needs. We produce all of our edible bird’ nest products at our facility located in Setia Alam, Selangor, Malaysia. At our processing facility, raw birds’ nest purchased from swiftlet ranchers is shipped to our facility where the raw product is subject to the following process: Grading of raw material à Soaking à Cleaning à Moulding à QC à Drying à Packaging à Edible Birds’ Nest. We developed a reverse osmosis technique to process our birds’ nest, and it contains no additives or chemicals, like nitrates or bleaching agents, unlike other providers, including our competitor in Malaysia. We process, manufacture and package our birds’ nest drink products at our processing facility. Our the facial and skin and body care products which contain bird nest extract are produced by third party contract manufacturers located in Malaysia in accordance with our product specifications and with ingredients sourced by us and shipped to the manufacturing for production. We ship the processed birds’ nest directly to these manufacturers. Non birds’ nest products are produced by another third party contract manufacturer located in Malaysia . 31 Markets and Competition. While the primary market is the Chinese community around the world, mainly China, Taiwan, Singapore and North America, there are new emerging markets such as Middle East, Japan and Korea. The demand for birds' nest products is amplified during Chinese festivals, such as the Lunar Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), when gifts of birds’ nest are synonymous with wealth and good fortune. We face competition locally from Malaysia and internationally from China with respect to our edible birds’ nest product. These competitors likely have greater financial and other resources, including channels of distribution, than we do. However, we have and will continue to maintain the highest quality ingredients and manufacturing standards to insure a top tier product. We expect to compete in this market by providing a high qualify product which is reasonably priced for the consumer. In addition, as mentioned above, we do no use bleaching agents in the processing of birds’ nests. We also are hopeful that our Zuo Yan Instant Birds’ Nest Drink will gain traction in the marketplace. We believe that we are the only producer of a ready-to-drink birds’ nest product in the Far East. We introduced this product in February, 2017 and to date, sales have been limited. However, we believe that there is a strong market potential for this product due the ease of use. Historically, birds nest drinks or soups required boiling or cooking the actual birds’ nest for over two hours. Our ready to drink product is a powder which has been created through a process which we developed. Warm or cold water to be added to the powder to create the drink. Under the proprietary process that we developed, we dehydrate raw birds nest to produce it in powdered form. With respect to our other health care products, we face competition from many other health care companies located in Malaysia and China. Substantially all of these companies will have greater financial and other resources than we do. Our Growth Strategy We will look to grow and expand our business by further penetrating the market in China and Malaysia. We believe that an increase in our marketing and promotional efforts will correlate to increased revenues and the expansion of our business. Our growth and expansion strategy for the next 6-12 months is as follows:  Leverage our existing channels for our main product . We expect product sales of our ready to drink birds’ nest to continue to grow in China though the efforts of our existing distributor. We commenced sales of the product in Hong Kong and in mainland China in January 2017. In mainland China, we initially targeted the Beijing market. We expect our sales of this product to grow by 10% year to year for in the year 2020 as we continue to penetrate other metropolitan markets in China, including Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shandong. In Malaysia, we also expect our domestic sales to grow 10% year to year for the next 5 years as we penetrate the market and sell to more pharmacies and health care shops.  The commercial introduction of other products . In third quarter of 2018, we began selling a number of our products, such as our Zuo Yan brand Bird Nest Extract Shower Gel (500ml), Birds Nest Body Lotion (250ml), and Birds’ Nest Tremella Mask, Cleanser, Serum and Moisturizer and MaxiFirm, to dermatologists and aesthetic centres in Malaysia. To date, sales of these products have accounted for 1% of total sales for fiscal year 2018.  Use other channels for product marketing . In addition to our retail sales and sales through distributors, during the 3 rd quarter 2019, we intend to promote our edible bird nest product awareness through advertising in health care newspapers and magazines and television ads in Malaysia and China.  Expand Market for DNA test and DNA Precision Supplement Blend . To a lesser extent, we plans to expand market for DNA testing and personalized nutrition through advertising in health care newspapers and magazines also in Malaysia and China. 32 Regulatory Matters We are unaware of and do not anticipate having to expend significant resources to comply with any governmental regulations.

We had a loss from operations of $241,500 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared with a loss from operations of $177,703 for the same period in 2018 due the reasons discussed above.

Foreign currency adjustment is a result of unrealized profit or loss on conversion to U.S. dollars of assets and liabilities that are accounted for in Malaysian Ringgit. Comprehensive Loss . We had a comprehensive loss of $206,767 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared with a comprehensive loss of $165,581 for same period in 2018 for the reasons discussed above. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of March 31, 2019, we had a working capital deficit of $151,280 compared with working capital of $89,270 as of December 31, 2018. The decrease in working capital as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 is due principally to net loss for the first quarter of 2019, as well as an increase in our non-current assets. Our operations have been funds by private placements of our common stock and loans from a shareholder. 37 Since our inception, we have raised a total of $3,806,150 from the sale of 73,575,000 shares of common stock. In addition, we also have received the sum of $678,623 under a term loan with a shareholder. As of March 31, 2019, we have $705,836 (including interest) due under this loan agreement. The term of the loan is 24 years with monthly payments of principal and interest. Interest accrues on the loan at the rate of 4.75% per annum. Yearly payments are as follows; - 2019 $ 13,462 - 2020 16,865 - 2021 17,685 - 2022 18,543 - 2023 19,443 Thereafter 619,838 Our primary uses of cash have been for operations. The main sources of cash have been from operational revenues and the private placement of our common stock. The following trends are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity over the near to long term:  Addition of administrative and marketing personnel as the business grows,  Development of a Company website,  Increases in advertising and marketing in order to attempt to generate more revenues, and  The cost of being a public company. The Company believes that it will be required to raise additional funds in order for it to sustain its operations. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. · Basis of presentation These accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). · Use of estimates In preparing these financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. · Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. · Plant and equipment Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis to write off the cost over the following expected useful lives of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used are as follows: Categories Principal Annual Rates/Expected Useful Life Furniture & fittings 10% Lab Equipment 10% Office equipment 20% 38 Fully depreciated plant and equipment are retained in the financial statements until they are no longer in use. · Inventories Inventories consisting of products available for sell, are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of inventory is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory reserve is recorded to write down the cost of inventory to the estimated market value due to slow-moving merchandise and damaged goods, which is dependent upon factors such as historical and forecasted consumer demand, and promotional environment. The Company takes ownership, risks and rewards of the products purchased. Write downs are recorded in cost of revenues in the Condensed Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. · Revenue recognition Revenue recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the enterprise and the amount of the revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable. a. Sales of goods or rendering of services An entity shall recognize revenue associated with the transaction by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period. The outcome of a transaction can be estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied: - i. The amount of revenue can be measured reliably; ii. It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; iii. The stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; and iv. The costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably. b. Interest income Interest is recognized on receipt basis. · Cost of revenues Cost of revenue includes the purchase cost of retail goods for re-sale to customers and packing materials (such as boxes). It excludes purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs, internal transfer costs and other costs of distribution network in cost of revenues. · Shipping and handling fees Shipping and handling fees, if billed to customers, are included in revenue. Shipping ang handling fees associated with inbound and outbound freight are expensed as incurred and included in selling and distribution expenses. · Comprehensive income ASC Topic 220, “ Comprehensive Income ” establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income as defined 39 includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented in the accompanying statements of stockholders’ equity consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation and cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments held at the balance sheet date. This comprehensive income is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit. · Income tax expense Income taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “ Income Taxes ” (“ASC Topic 740”). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclosed in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. The Company conducts major businesses in Malaysia and is subject to tax in their own jurisdictions. As a result of its business activities, the Company will file separate tax returns that are subject to examination by the foreign tax authorities. · Foreign currencies translation Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations. The functional currency of the Company is the United States Dollars (“US$”) and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US$. In addition, the Company maintains its books and record in a local currency, Malaysian Ringgit (“MYR” or “RM”), which is functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates. In general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, “ Translation of Financial Statement” , using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Translation of amounts from the local currency of the Company into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective years: As of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 2017 Year-end MYR: US$1 exchange rate 4.1391 4.0620 Yearly average MYR: US$1 exchange rate 4.0355 4.3004 40 · Related parties Parties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. · Fair value of financial instruments The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, trade receivable, deposits and other receivables, amount due to related parties and other payables approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. The Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, “ Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ” ("ASC 820-10"), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: · Level 1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; · Level 2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and · Level 3 : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, the Company did not have any nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements, at least annually, on a recurring basis, nor did the Company have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. · Recent accounting pronouncements The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2014-09”). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)”, and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update to defer by one year the effective dates of its new revenue recognition standard until annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (2018 for calendar-year public entities) and interim periods therein. This adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going concern (Subtopic 205-40) which provides guidance to an organization’s management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. This guidance in ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim 41 reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. This adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis." ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. It is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. This adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory, which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We will recognize our inventories at cost or net realizable value, whichever lower. In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance, lessees will be required recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: 1) A lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and 2) A right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The new lease guidance simplified the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those years. The Company is evaluating this ASU and has not determined the effect of this standard on its ongoing financial reporting. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business (ASU 2017-01), which revises the definition of a business and provides new guidance in evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, on a prospective basis and do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Conflicts of Interest Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit committee financial expert, nor has the Board established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion that such committees are not necessary since the Company is an early stage company, and to date, such directors have been performing the functions of such committees. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our Directors and Officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation, nominations, and audit issues that may affect management decisions. In addition, our Officers have committed to spend a sufficient amount of time and attention to the affairs of the Company to fulfill their respective officer responsibilities. In this regard, generally, each Officer spends between 15 to 40 hours per week on the affairs of the Company, depending on the circumstances. Therefore, we may face conflicts of interest between the time and attention each Officer devotes to the Company and that of their other business interests. Other than as described above, we are not aware of any other conflicts of interest of our executive Officers and Directors. Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings There are no legal proceedings that have occurred since our incorporation concerning our Director, or control persons which involved a criminal conviction, a criminal proceeding, an administrative or civil proceeding limiting one’s participation in the securities or banking industries, or a finding of securities or commodities law violations. Our Officers and Directors have not received monetary compensation since our inception to the date of this prospectus. We currently do not pay any compensation to our Directors serving on our Board of Directors. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION During fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively, except as stated in the Summary Compensation Table below, we have not paid any salaries or other compensation to officers, directors or employees. We do not have a bonus, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan for the benefit of employees, officers or directors. Further, we have not entered into an employment agreement with any of our officers, directors or any other persons and no such agreements are anticipated in the immediate future. We expect that our officers and directors will defer, and not accrue, any compensation until such time as the company is in a better financial position and will strive to have the business opportunity provide their remuneration. As of the date hereof, no person has accrued any compensation.

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES Authorized Capital Stock Our authorized capital stock consists of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, no par value per share, and 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value per share. As of the date of this filing, there were 76,518,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding that was held by 106 stockholders of record and no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. Common Stock The holders of our common stock have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available if and when declared by our board of directors and are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs. Our common stock does not provide the right to a preemptive, subscription or conversion 47 rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights. Our common stock holders are entitled to one non-cumulative vote per share on all matters on which shareholders may vote. We refer you to our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and the applicable statutes of the state of Wyoming for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of our securities. All material terms of our common stock have been addressed in this section. Holders of shares of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares, voting for the election of directors, can elect all of the directors to be elected, if they so choose, and, in that event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any of our directors. Preferred Stock We are also authorized to issue 30,000,000 shares which have been established as the Series A Preferred Stock. No shares of our Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding. The share of preferred stock are “blank check” meaning the Company’s Board of Directors can issue shares of preferred stock in such series with such rights, privileges and preferences as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. The ability of directors, without security holder approval, to issue shares of our Series A Preferred Stock could be used as an anti-takeover measure. Anti-takeover measures may result in you receiving less compensation for your stock. Dividend Policy It is unlikely that we will declare or pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain earnings, if any, to expand our operations. To date, we have paid no dividends on our shares of common stock and have no present intention of paying any dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment by us of dividends on the shares of common stock in the future, if any, rests solely within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.

The outcome of a transaction can be estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied: - i) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably; ii) It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; iii) The stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; and iv) The costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably. b. Interest income Interest is recognized on receipt basis. - F7 – · Cost of revenues Cost of revenue includes the purchase cost of retail goods for re-sale to customers and packing materials (such as boxes). It excludes purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs, internal transfer costs and other costs of distribution network in cost of revenues. · Shipping and handling fees Shipping and handling fees, if billed to customers, are included in revenue. Shipping ang handling fees associated with inbound and outbound freight are expensed as incurred and included in selling and distribution expenses. · Comprehensive income ASC Topic 220, “ Comprehensive Income ” establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented in the accompanying statements of stockholders’ equity consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation and cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments held at the balance sheet date. This comprehensive income is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit. · Income tax expense Income taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “ Income Taxes ” (“ASC Topic 740”). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. · Income tax expense (continued) ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclosed in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. The Company conducts major businesses in Malaysia and is subject to tax in their own jurisdictions. As a result of its business activities, the Company will file separate tax returns that are subject to examination by the foreign tax authorities. · Foreign currencies translation Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations. - F8 - The functional currency of the Company is the United States Dollars (“US$”) and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US$. In addition, the Company maintains its books and record in a local currency, Malaysian Ringgit (“MYR” or “RM”), which is functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates. In general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, “ Translation of Financial Statement” , using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Translation of amounts from the local currency of the Company into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective years: As of and for the 12 months period ended December 31, 2018 2017 Year-end MYR: US$1 exchange rate 4.1385 4.0620 Yearly average MYR: US$1 exchange rate 4.0362 4.2812 · Related parties Parties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. · Fair value of financial instruments The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, trade receivable, deposits and other receivables, amount due to related parties and other payables approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. The Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, “ Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ” ("ASC 820-10"), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: · Level 1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; · Level 2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and · Level 3 : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions As of December 31, 2017 and 2018, the Company did not have any nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements, at least annually, on a recurring basis, nor did the Company have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. - F9 - · Recent accounting pronouncements The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2014-09”). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)”, and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update to defer by one year the effective dates of its new revenue recognition standard until annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (2018 for calendar-year public entities) and interim periods therein. This adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going concern (Subtopic 205-40) which provides guidance to an organization’s management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. This guidance in ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. This adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis." ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. It is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. This adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory, which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We will recognize our inventories at cost or net realizable value, whichever lower. In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance, lessees will be required recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: 1) A lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and 2) A right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The new lease guidance simplified the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those years. The Company is evaluating this ASU and has not determined the effect of this standard on its ongoing financial reporting. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business (ASU 2017-01), which revises the definition of a business and provides new guidance in evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, on a prospective basis and do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. - F10 - 3 OTHER RECEIVABLES AND DEPOSITS As of December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Other receivables $ 2,045 $ 34,365 Amount owing by related parties 556,871 742,015 Deposits and prepayments 38,556 370,039 597,472 1,146,419 The amount owing by related parties is unsecured, interest-free with no fixed repayment term. 4.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES · Basis of presentation These accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). · Use of estimates In preparing these financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. - F6 – · Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. · Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis to write off the cost over the following expected useful lives of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used are as follows: Categories Principal Annual Rates/Expected Useful Life Furniture & fittings 10% Office equipment 25% Software 25% Plant and equipment 10% Renovation 10% Building 3% Factory equipment 10% Bird house 3% Fully depreciated property, plant and equipment are retained in the financial statements until they are no longer in use. · Inventories Inventories consisting of products available for sell, are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of inventory is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory reserve is recorded to write down the cost of inventory to the estimated market value due to slow-moving merchandise and damaged goods, which is dependent upon factors such as historical and forecasted consumer demand, and promotional environment. The Company takes ownership, risks and rewards of the products purchased. Write downs are recorded in cost of revenues in the Condensed Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. · Revenue recognition Revenue recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the enterprise and the amount of the revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable. a. Sales of goods or rendering of services An entity shall recognize revenue associated with the transaction by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period. The outcome of a transaction can be estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied: - v) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably; vi) It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; vii) The stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; and viii) The costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably. b. Interest income Interest is recognized on receipt basis. - F7 - · Cost of revenues Cost of revenue includes the purchase cost of retail goods for re-sale to customers and packing materials (such as boxes). It excludes purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs, internal transfer costs and other costs of distribution network in cost of revenues. · Shipping and handling fees Shipping and handling fees, if billed to customers, are included in revenue. Shipping ang handling fees associated with inbound and outbound freight are expensed as incurred and included in selling and distribution expenses. · Comprehensive income ASC Topic 220, “ Comprehensive Income ” establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented in the accompanying statements of stockholders’ equity consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation and cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments held at the balance sheet date. This comprehensive income is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit. · Income tax expense Income taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “ Income Taxes ” (“ASC Topic 740”). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclosed in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. The Company conducts major businesses in Malaysia and is subject to tax in their own jurisdictions. As a result of its business activities, the Company will file separate tax returns that are subject to examination by the foreign tax authorities. · Foreign currencies translation Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations. - F8 – The functional currency of the Company is the United States Dollars (“US$”) and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US$. In addition, the Company maintains its books and record in a local currency, Malaysian Ringgit (“MYR” or “RM”), which is functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates. In general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, “ Translation of Financial Statement” , using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Translation of amounts from the local currency of the Company into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective years: As of and for the 3 months period ended March 31, 2019 2018 Period-end MYR: US$1 exchange rate 4.0810 3.8620 Period average MYR: US$1 exchange rate 4.0800 3.8940 · Related parties Parties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. · Fair value of financial instruments The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, trade receivable, deposits and other receivables, amount due to related parties and other payables approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. The Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, “ Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ” ("ASC 820-10"), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: · Level 1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; · Level 2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and · Level 3 : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions As of December 31, 2017 and 2018, the Company did not have any nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements, at least annually, on a recurring basis, nor did the Company have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. - F9 – · Recent accounting pronouncements The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2014-09”). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)”, and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update to defer by one year the effective dates of its new revenue recognition standard until annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (2018 for calendar-year public entities) and interim periods therein. This adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going concern (Subtopic 205-40) which provides guidance to an organization’s management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. This guidance in ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. This adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis." ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. It is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. This adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory, which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We will recognize our inventories at cost or net realizable value, whichever lower. In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance, lessees will be required recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: 1) A lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and 2) A right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The new lease guidance simplified the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those years. The Company is evaluating this ASU and has not determined the effect of this standard on its ongoing financial reporting. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business (ASU 2017-01), which revises the definition of a business and provides new guidance in evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, on a prospective basis and do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. - F10 – 3 OTHER RECEIVABLES AND DEPOSITS As of March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Other receivables $ 389 $ 2,045 Amount owing by related parties 568,858 556,871 Deposits and prepayments 35,823 38,556 605,070 597,472 The amount owing by related parties is unsecured, interest-free with no fixed repayment term. 4.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers Section 17-16-851 of the Wyoming Business Corporation Act (WBCA) provides that a corporation may indemnify directors and officers against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in which such person is made a party by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director or officer (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation - a "derivative action"), if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful. A similar standard is applicable in the case of derivative actions, except that indemnification only extends to expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such action, and the statute requires court approval before there can be any indemnification where the person seeking indemnification has been found liable to the corporation. The statute provides that it is not exclusive of other indemnification that may be granted by a corporation's by-laws, disinterested director vote, stockholder vote, agreement or otherwise. Pursuant to Article VI of our Bylaws, the Company has the power to indemnify current or former directors, officers, employees, and agents to the fullest extent provided in its Articles of Incorporation and by the WBCA as amended and in effect on the date of the adoption of this article. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is theretofore unenforceable. 51 Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On June 25, 2018, pursuant to a series of Stock Exchange Agreements, Billion Suntincen Holding Limited, a Wyoming company, acquired all of the capital stock of Billion Faith International Bhd, a Malaysian company (“Subsidiary”), from its then existing shareholders, a total of 106 shareholders. On July 26, 2018 a total of 73,575,000 shares of the Company were issued to all of the shareholders of the Subsidiary. In addition, Biotech Precision Berhad, Ms. Chia, Siew Nian and Mr. Xu, Chi Yan, each received 4,605,076 shares of common stock, and Chen, Deying received 7,123,243 shares of common stock. As a result, each party became a greater than 5% shareholder of the Company. On July 26, 2018, the Company issued a total of 86,982,000 shares of common stock (“Trust Shares”) to 38 trustees of the Company. On May 17, 2019, the Company cancelled the Trust Shares and the Trust Shares were returned to the Company’s treasury. The offer and sale of the securities above was effected under Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act, as amended, as each such shareholder represented in writing to the Company that he/she/it is a non-US Person, was not acquiring the shares on behalf of a US Person, and will not sell the shares unless pursuant to a registration statement or an available exemption. Item 16. Undertakings The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales of securities are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement to: (i) Include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (§230.424(b) of this chapter) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement. (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser: If the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration 52 statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. (5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or our securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”) may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 53 Item 17.
