THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. ADVENTO, INC. We are a development stage company and intend to commence operations in the distribution of shower cabinets. Advento, Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on August 4, 2010. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations (See Description of Business and Use of Proceeds). Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. Our principal executive offices are located at 8 Jiang gang Qu, Ste 402, Hangzhou, China 310000. Our phone number is 011-86-13083976291 Advento, Inc. started operations on August 4, 2010. We plan to distribute a broad variety of shower cabinets to North American market. From inception until the date of this filing, we have had very limited operating activities. Our financial statements from inception (August 4, 2010) through the year ended April 30, 2011, reports no revenues and a net loss of $179. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for Advento, Inc. which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, we have developed our business plan and entered into Sales Contract with Hangzhou Yongsheng Holdings Co., Ltd, a private Chinese manufacturer that produces high quality shower cabinets. As of the date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our securities will ever develop. THE OFFERING The Issuer: Advento, Inc. Securities Being Offered: 2,000,000 shares of common stock Price Per Share: $0.05 Duration of the Offering: The shares will be offered for a period of two hundred forty (240) days from the effective date of this prospectus. The offering shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the date when the sale of all 2,000,000 shares is completed, (ii) when the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interest of the Company to terminate the offering prior the completion of the sale of all 2,000,000 shares registered under the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is part. The Company will deliver stock certificates attributable to shares of common stock purchased directly to the purchasers within ninety (90) days of the close of the offering.

Risk Factors See Risk Factors and the other information in this prospectus for a discussion of the factors you should consider before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. 5 | Page SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION The tables and information below are derived from our audited financial statements for the period from August 4, 2010(Inception) to April 30, 2011. Financial Summary As of April 30, 2011 (Audited) ($) Cash and Deposits 2,495 Total Assets 2,495 Total Liabilities 174 Total Stockholders Equity 2,321 Statement of Operations Accumulated From August 4, 2010 (Inception) to April 30, 2011 Audited) ($) Total Expenses 179 Net Loss for the Period (179) RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock, when and if we trade at a later date, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. RISKS ASSOCIATED TO OUR BUSINESS WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE COMMENCED LIMITED OPERATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We were incorporated on August 4, 2010 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We have commenced limited business operations. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new distribution companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. Prior to shipping fist shower cabinets, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail. WE ARE SOLELY DEPENDENT UPON THE FUNDS TO BE RAISED IN THIS OFFERING TO START OUR BUSINESS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE REVENUES. WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. Our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations in distribution of shower cabinets. We need the proceeds from this offering to commence activities that will allow us to begin seeking financing of our business plan. As of April 30, 2011, we had cash in the amount of $2,495 and liabilities of $179. As of this date, we have had limited operations and no income. We may need additional funds to complete further development of our business plan to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. 6 | Page ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING WE ARRANGE THROUGH THE SALE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WILL RESULT IN DILUTION TO EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS. We must raise additional capital in order for our business plan to succeed. Our most likely source of additional capital will be through the sale of additional shares of common stock. Such stock issuances will cause stockholders' interests in our company to be diluted. Such dilution will negatively affect the value of investors shares. WE HAVE YET TO EARN REVENUE AND OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE FINANCING. AS A RESULT, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. We have accrued net losses of $179 for the period from our inception on August 4, 2010 to the year ended April 30, 2011, and have no revenues as of this date. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations. Further, the finances required to fully develop our plan cannot be predicted with any certainty and may exceed any estimates we set forth. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. RONALD R. CHADWICK, P.C. our independent registered public accounting firm, has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise. If we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed, we will not be able to complete our business plan. As a result we may have to liquidate our business and you may lose your investment. You should consider our independent registered public accountants comments when determining if an investment in Advento, Inc. is suitable. We require minimum funding of approximately $30,000 to conduct our proposed operations for a minimum period of one year. Expenditures over the next 12 months are therefore expected to exceed the sum of both our cash on hand and amount to be raised in this offering. If we experience such a shortage of funds prior to funding during the next 12 months, we may utilize funds from Liang Wei Wang, our sole officer and director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees, including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses, however he has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. We will require the funds from this offering to proceed. If we are successful in raising the funds from this offering, we plan to commence activities to raise the funds required for the development program. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to proceed with any work or activities of the development program. We plan to raise additional funding for development by way of a private debt or equity financing, but have not commenced any activities to raise such funds and have no current plans on how to raise such funds. IF WE DO NOT ATTRACT CUSTOMERS, WE WILL NOT MAKE A PROFIT, WHICH ULTIMATELY WILL RESULT IN A CESSATION OF OPERATIONS. We currently have no customers to buy shower cabinets from us. We have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee we ever will have any customers. Even if we obtain customers, there is no guarantee that we will generate a profit. If we cannot generate a profit, we will have to suspend or cease operations. You are likely to lose your entire investment if we cannot rent automobiles at prices which generate a profit. WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE WITH OUR COMPETITORS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competition includes large, small and midsized companies, and many of them may distribute the same or similar shower cabinets in our markets at competitive prices. Highly competitive environment could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. 7 | Page OUR SALES AND PROFITABILITY DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON NEW RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITY. Our sales depend heavily on the strength of national and local new residential construction and home improvement and remodeling markets. The strength of these markets depends on new housing starts and residential renovation projects, which are a function of many factors beyond our control. Some of these factors include employment levels, job and household formation, interest rates, housing prices, tax policy, availability of mortgage financing, prices of commodity wood products, regional demographics and consumer confidence. Future downturns in the markets that we serve or in the economy generally could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Reduced levels of construction activity may result in intense price competition among sanitary ware suppliers, which may adversely affect our gross margins. ALL OF OUR PRODUCT PURCHASES WILL BE MADE FROM ONE SUPPLIER. IF THAT SUPPLIER DECREASES OR TERMINATES ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH US OUR BUSINESS WOULD LIKELY FAIL IF WE ARE UNABLE TO FIND A SUBSTITUTE FOR THAT COMPANY. As a result of being totally dependent on a single wholesale supplier located in China, we may be subject to certain risks, including changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers, increased pressure, timing and availability of export licenses, the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws and treaties, and uncertainties relative to regional, political and economic circumstances. We purchase our products from Hangzhou Yongsheng Holdings Co., Ltd, a private Chinese manufacturer. Our agreement with this company does not prevent it from supplying its shower cabinets to our competitors or directly to consumers. The Contract has no minimum term, and Hangzhou Yongsheng Holdings Co., Ltd may terminate the Contract at any time. If this company decreases, modifies or terminates its association with us for any other reason, we would suffer an interruption in our business unless and until we found a substitute for that supplier. If we were unable to find a substitute for that supplier, our business would likely fail. We cannot predict what the likelihood would be of finding an acceptable substitute supplier. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS, OUR BUSINESS CAN BE EFFECTED BY CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS OUR SUPPLIER IS A CHINESE COMPANY AND ALL ITS OPERATIONS ARE IN CHINESE YUAN. Currently, we are required by contract with our supplier to buy products in US Dollars, but all our suppliers operations are in Chinese Yuan, so we are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. To protect our business, we may enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with major financial institutions to hedge the overseas purchase transactions and limit our exposure to those fluctuations. If we are not able to successfully protect ourselves against those currency rate fluctuations, then our profits on the products subject to those fluctuations would also fluctuate and could cause us to be less profitable or incur losses, even if our business is doing well. BECAUSE WE WILL PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS FROM OVERSEAS, A DISRUPTION IN THE DELIVERY OF IMPORTED PRODUCTS MAY HAVE A GREATER EFFECT ON US THAN ON OUR COMPETITORS. We will import our product from China. Because we will import our product and deliver it directly to our customers, we believe that disruptions in shipping deliveries may have a greater effect on us than on competitors who manufacture and/or warehouse products in the United States or Canada. Deliveries of our products may be disrupted through factors such as: (1) raw material shortages, work stoppages, strikes and political unrest; (2) problems with ocean shipping, including work stoppages and shipping container shortages; (3) increased inspections of import shipments or other factors causing delays in shipments; and (4) economic crises, international disputes and wars. 8 | Page Most of our competitors warehouse products they import from overseas, which allows them to continue delivering their products for the near term, despite overseas shipping disruptions. If our competitors are able to deliver products when we cannot, our reputation may be damaged and we may lose customers to our competitors. BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL, OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT CLIENTS TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. IF WE DO NOT MAKE A PROFIT, WE WILL SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS. Due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our product known to potential customers. Because we will be limiting our marketing activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to suspend or cease operations. BECAUSE COMPANYS HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, U.S. INVESTORS MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES IN ATTEMPTING TO AFFECT SERVICE OF PROCESS AND TO ENFORCE JUDGMENTS BASED UPON U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND ITS NON U.S. RESIDENT OFFICER AND DIRECTOR. While we are organized under the laws of State of Nevada, Liang Wei Wang, our sole officer and director is a non-U.S. resident, and our headquarters are located outside of the United States. Consequently, it may be difficult for investors to affect service of process on him in the United States and to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in United States courts against him based on the civil liability provisions of the United States securities laws. Since all our assets will be located in Canada it may be difficult or impossible for U.S. investors to collect a judgment against us. As well, any judgment obtained in the United States against us may not be enforceable. BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WILL OWN 55.56% OR MORE OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, HE WILL MAKE AND CONTROL CORPORATE DECISIONS THAT MAY BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS. If maximum offering shares will be sold, Mr. Wang, our sole officer and director, will own 55.56% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of Mr. Wang may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders. IF LIANG WEI WANG, OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR, SHOULD RESIGN OR DIE, WE WILL NOT HAVE A CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WHICH COULD RESULT IN OUR OPERATIONS SUSPENDING. IF THAT SHOULD OCCUR, YOU COULD LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT. We extremely depend on the services of our sole officer and director, Liang Wei Wang, for the future success of our business. The loss of the services of Mr. Wang could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If he should resign or die we will not have a chief executive officer. If that should occur, until we find another person to act as our chief executive officer, our operations could be suspended. In that event it is possible you could lose your entire investment. BECAUSE OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT HAS OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS, HE MAY NOT BE ABLE OR WILLING TO DEVOTE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIME TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, CAUSING OUR BUSINESS TO FAIL. Liang Wei Wang, our President, currently devotes approximately twenty hours per week providing management services to us. While he presently possesses adequate time to attend to our interest, it is possible that the demands on him from other obligations could increase, with the result that he would no longer be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business. The loss of Mr. Wang to our company could negatively impact our business development. 9 | Page RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING INVESTORS CANNOT WITHDRAW FUNDS ONCE INVESTED AND WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND. Investors do not have the right to withdraw invested funds. Subscription payments will be paid to Advento, Inc. and held on our corporate bank account if the Subscription Agreements are in good order and the investor is accepted as an investor by the Company. Therefore, once an investment is made, investors will not have the use or right to return of such funds. OUR PRESIDENT, MR. WANG DOES NOT HAVE ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE CONDUCTING A BEST-EFFORT OFFERING AND AS A RESULT OF THIS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS SUCCESSFULLY. Mr. Wang does not have any experience conducting a best-effort offering. Consequently, we may not be able to raise any funds successfully. If we are not able to raise sufficient funds, we may not be able to fund our operations as planned, and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to successfully conduct a best-effort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us. OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS NO EXPERIENCE MANAGING A PUBLIC COMPANY WHICH IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROL AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. We have never operated as a public company. Liang Wei Wang, our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations, which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected. THE TRADING IN OUR SHARES WILL BE REGULATED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULE 15G-9 WHICH ESTABLISHED THE DEFINITION OF A PENNY STOCK. The shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $2,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES. This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to sell our shares through our President, who will receive no commissions. There is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless he is successful in selling all of the shares and we receive the proceeds from this offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan. 10 | Page DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING. We are not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB). The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities. The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements per se, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. Market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings between Advento, Inc. and anyone acting on our behalf, with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment. WE WILL INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE. WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL. Our business plan allows for the payment of the estimated $8,000 cost of this registration statement to be paid from existing cash on hand. If necessary, Liang Wei Wang, our Chairman, has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend, and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us as described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus. USE OF PROCEEDS Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per share is $0.05. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $100,000 as anticipated. Gross proceeds $25,000 $50,000 $75,000 $100,000 Legal and professional fees $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 Website development $ 2,000 $ 3,000 $ 4,000 $ 5,000 Establishing an office $ 2,000 $ 2,500 $ 3,000 $ 4,000 Marketing and advertising $ 10,000 $ 15,000 $ 30,000 $ 45,000 Hire a sales person $ - $ 15,000 $ 20,000 $ 25,000 Miscellaneous expenses $ 1,000 $ 4,500 $ 8,000 $ 11,000 The above figures represent only estimated costs. If necessary, Liang Wei Wang, our sole officer and director, has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process but we will require full funding to implement our complete business plan. 11 | Page DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities. DILUTION The price of the current offering is fixed at $0.05 per share. This price is significantly higher than the price paid by the Companys sole director and officer for common equity since the Companys inception on August 4, 2010. Liang Wei Wang, the Companys sole officer and director, paid $.001 per share for the 2,500,000 shares of common stock he purchased from the Company. Dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders. The following tables compare the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing stockholders. As of April 30, 2011, the net tangible book value of our shares of common stock was $2,321 or approximately $ 0.0009 per share based upon 2,500,000 shares outstanding. If 100% of the Shares Are Sold: Upon completion of this offering, in the event all of the shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 4,500,000 shares to be outstanding will be $102,321 or approximately $0.0227 per share. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be increased by $0.0218 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.05 per share to $0.0227 per share. After completion of this offering, if 2,000,000 shares are sold, investors in the offering will own 44.44% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $100,000, or $0.05 per share. Both the 44.44% ownership and $100,000 cash investment are in the aggregate. Our existing stockholders will own 55.56% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which they have made contributions of cash totalling $2,500.00 or $0.001 per share. If 75% of the Shares Are Sold Upon completion of this offering, in the event 1,500,000 shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 4,000,000 shares to be outstanding will be $77,321, or approximately $0.0193 per share. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be increased by $0.0184 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.05 per share to $0.0193 per share. After completion of this offering investors in the offering will own 37.5% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $75,000, or $0.05 per share. Both the 37.5% ownership and $75,000 cash investment are in the aggregate. Our existing stockholders will own 62.5% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which they have made contributions of cash totaling $2,500.00 or $0.001 per share. 12 | Page If 50% of the Shares Are Sold Upon completion of this offering, in the event 1,000,000 shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 3,500,000 shares to be outstanding will be $52,321, or approximately $0.0149 per share. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be increased by $0.014 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.05 per share to $0.0149per share. After completion of this offering investors in the offering will own approximately 28.57% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $50,000, or $0.05 per share. Both the 28.57% ownership and $50,000 cash investment are in the aggregate. Our existing stockholders will own approximately 71.43% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which they have made contributions of cash totaling $2,500.00 or $0.001 per share. If 25% of the Shares Are Sold Upon completion of this offering, in the event 500,000 shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 3,000,000 shares to be outstanding will be $27,321, or approximately $0.0091 per share.

All proceeds will be deposited into our corporate bank account. If necessary, Liang Wei Wang, our sole officer and director, has agreed to loan, in his sole discretion, the Company funds to complete the registration process but we will require full funding to implement our complete business plan. Mr. Wang has no firm commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the Company. 14 | Page MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION This section of the prospectus includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. Our cash balance is $2,495 as of April 30, 2011. We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Liang Wei Wang, our Chairman, President, and Secretary, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. Mr. Wang, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to achieve our business plan goals, we will need the funding from this offering and substantial additional funding. We are a development stage company and have generated no revenue to date. Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage. To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. We believe that we will be able to raise enough money through this offering to expand operations but we cannot guarantee that once we expand operations we will stay in business after doing so. If we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering. If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Even if we raise $100,000 from this offering, it will last one year, but we may need more funds to develop growth strategy, and we will have to revert to obtaining additional money. Plan of Operation After the effectiveness of our registration statement by the Securities and Exchange Commissions, we intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital. During this period, our operations will be limited due to the limited amount of funds on hand. Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to profitably distribute shower cabinets. Our plan of operations following the completion is as follows: ESTABLISH OUR OFFICE Period: 1 st -2 nd months Cost: $2,000-$3,000 Upon the completion of the offering, we plan to expand our office and acquire the necessary equipment we need to begin operations. We will spend our office budget on purchasing computers, office furniture and miscellaneous office supplies. Our sole officer and director will handle our administrative duties. DEVELOP OUR WEBSITE Period: 3 rd -5 th months Cost: $2,000-$5,000 Once we have completed the offering and office is established, we will begin to develop our website. We believe that it will cost between $2,000 and $5,000 for our website to be operational. It will take up to 90 days to develop our website. There will be information about us, the variety of shower cabinets we will offer, information on how to order our product, advantages of our shower cabinets against, installation instructions and other information. Updating and improving our website will continue throughout the lifetime of our operations. 15 | Page COMMENCE MARKETING CAMPAIGN Period: 5 th -12 th months Cost: $10,000-$40,000 Once our website is operational, we will begin to market our product. We will develop our client base by focusing our marketing efforts on larger more globally known distribution chain stores. The large retailer stores sell a higher assortment of shower cabins, have a higher budget for in-stock inventory and tend to purchase a larger and more diverse inventory. We plan to attend various sanitary ware shows where we can promote our product and meet potential clients. By late 2012 we plan to expand our selection of shower cabinets by marketing to small and medium size distributors of shower cabinets who specialize in higher-end, shower cabinets. Any relationship we arrange with retailers for the wholesale distribution of our shower cabins will be non-exclusive. We will compete with other distributors and manufactures for positioning of our products in retail space. Our methods of communication will include: phone calls, email, and regular mail. We will continue our marketing efforts during the life of our operations. If we do not sell at least 50% of shares in this offering, we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our product known to potential customers. Because we will be limiting our marketing activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to suspend or cease operations. NEGOTIATE AGREEMENTS WITH POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS Period: 5 th -12 th months Cost: no material costs. When our website is operational, we also plan to contact and start negotiation with potential customers. We plan to enter into distribution and supply agreements with contractors and homebuilders, chain and retail stores and other distributors of shower cabinets. We will negotiate terms and conditions of collaboration. We also intend to study the North American sanitary ware and building material market. At the beginning, we plan to focus primarily on larger chain stores that sell various types of building materials, specialized home restoration stores and distributors that are responsible for marketing and selling shower cabinets. Then we plan to expand our target market to contactors, homebuilder, developers and shower cabinet installers. This activity will be ongoing throughout our operations. Even if we are able to obtain sufficient number of agreements at the end of the twelve month period, there is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and more importantly retain enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue and to successfully protect ourselves against those risks, then it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed. HIRE A SALES PERSON Period: 6 th -12 th months Cost: $15,000-$25,000 If we sell more than 50% of shares in this offering, we intend to hire one salesperson with good knowledge and connections in the sanitary ware distribution and construction industry to introduce our product. The salespersons job would be to find new potential purchasers, and to set up agreements with them to buy our shower cabinets. The negotiation of additional agreements with potential customers will be ongoing during the life of our operations. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that we will start to generate revenue from selling our shower cabinets by the end of 2012. We do not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to execute our operations, and we will need the funds from this offering to commence our planed business activities. We may also need to obtain additional financing to operate our business for the twelve months following completion of our public offering. Additional financing, whether through public or private equity or debt financing, arrangements with the security holder or other sources to fund operations, may not be available, or if available, may be on terms unacceptable to us. Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital. 16 | Page We expect to incur the following minimal expenses in the next 12 months in connection with our business operations: Professional fees in connection with reporting obligations $ 10,000 Office set-up $ 2,000 Website development $ 2,000 Advertising/Marketing $ 10,000 General administrative costs $ 6,000 Total: $ 30,000 Liang Wei Wang, our president will be devoting approximately twenty hours per week to our operations. Once we expand operations, and are able to attract more and more customers to buy our product, Mr. Wang has agreed to commit more time as required. Because Mr. Wang will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a cessation of operations. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. Results of operations From Inception on August 4, 2010 to April 30, 2011 During the period we incorporated the company, prepared a business plan and executed Sales Contract with Hangzhou Yongsheng Holdings Co., Ltd, a private Chinese manufacturer that produce high quality shower cabinets. Our loss since inception is $179 for filing costs related to the incorporation of the Company. We have not meaningfully commenced our proposed business operations and will not do so until we have completed this offering. Since inception, we have sold 2,500,000 shares of common stock to our sole officer and director for net proceeds of $2,500. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of April 30, 2011, the Company had $2,495 cash and our liabilities were $179, comprising $179 owed to Liang Wei Wang, our sole officer and director. The available capital reserves of the Company are not sufficient for the Company to remain operational. 17 | Page Since inception, we have sold 2,500,000 shares of common stock in one offer and sale, which was to our sole officer and director, at a price of $0.001 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $2,500. To meet a small part our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise the necessary funds to proceed with all phases of our plan of operation. The sources of funding we may consider to fund this work include a public offering, a private placement of our securities or loans from our director or others. As of the date of this registration statement, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining a reporting status. The companys sole officer and director, Liang Wei Wang, has indicated that he may be willing to provide funds required to maintain the reporting status in the form of a non-secured loan for the next twelve months as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by the Company. However, there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement. Management believes if the company cannot maintain its reporting status with the SEC it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the company. As such, any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $10,000. Management believes that if subsequent private offerings of our equity or debt securities generate sufficient funds so that we can complete our development program, we will likely generate revenue by the end of 2012. However, such additional equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. We are highly dependent upon the success of the private offerings of equity or debt securities, as described herein. Therefore, the failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital from other resources such as taking loans, which would likely not even be possible for the Company. However, if such financing were available, because we are a development stage company with no operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its equity or debt securities, or secure a loan, the Company would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors would lose all of their investment. Management believes that current trends toward lower capital investment in start-up companies, volatility in the sanitary ware and building material distribution market pose the most significant challenges to the Companys success over the next year and in future years. Additionally, the Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Companys management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations. Should the Company fail to sell less than all its shares under this offering the Company would be forced to scale back or abort completely the implementation of its 12-month plan of operation. 18 | Page SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Company reports revenues and expenses using the accrual method of accounting for financial and tax reporting purposes. USE OF ESTIMATES Management uses estimates and assumption in preparing these financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 "Income Taxes" which codified SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" and FIN 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial Accounting Standards statements No. 107, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires the Company to disclose, when reasonably attainable, the fair market values of its assets and liabilities which are deemed to be financial instruments. The Companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash. PER SHARE INFORMATION The Company computes per share information by dividing the net loss for the period presented by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during such period. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS General We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 4, 2010. We are engaged in the distribution of shower cabinets. Our plan of operations for the next twelve months is complete this offering and to earn revenue from distribution. We have only recently begun our current operations and have not yet earned any revenues and have an operational loss of $179 from August 4, 2011 (date of inception) to April 30, 2011. Our principal office address is located at 8 Jiang gang Qu, Ste 402, Hangzhou, China 310000 . Our telephone number is 011-86-13083976291. Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations. We are a development stage company and it is likely that we will not be able to achieve profitability and will have to cease operations due to the lack of funding. We need the funds from this offering to carry out our current business plan. We also anticipate that we will require additional financing in order to execute our business plan. We plan to market and distribute an assortment of residential and commercial shower cabinets produced by Hangzhou Yongsheng Holdings Co., Ltd in the North American market. We plan to offer shower cabins with innovative features and can be customized to each consumers individual needs. Our shower cabinets will be offered at prices marked-up from 20% to 25% of our cost. Our customers will be asked to pay us 30% in advance and pay the remaining amount due before loading the container at sea port. 19 | Page We plan to fill placed orders and to supply the products within a period of thirty days (30) days or less following receipt of any written order. We do not intend to offer any credit terms relating to order payments. Our customers will be asked to pay us 30% in advance and pay the remaining amount before loading the container. Customers will have two options to pay for products: by wire transfer or by sending a check/money order. If customer decides to pay by check/money order, then we will apply a certain amount of days before shipping to have the check/money order cleared. Customers will be responsible to cover the shipping costs. Since we anticipate having a 30-day period to process/fill orders, we do not plan to purchase inventory in advance, but rather on request basis. We do not intend to store inventory for any period of time. The orders will be shipped to the customers upon customers requests. Customers will be responsible for the custom duties, taxes or any other additional charges that might incur. All shipments will be 100% insured for the value of the shipping. Insurance cost will be customers responsibility. As of April 30, 2011 we had $2,495 cash on hands and our liabilities were $174 comprising of $174 owing to Liang Wei Wang, our sole officer and director. The minimum amount of funds we need to raise for developing our business in the 12 months period following completion of this public offering is $30,000. We have not generated any revenue from operations to date. In order to expand our business operations, develop growth strategy and to continue maintaining a reporting status in the 12 month period following completion of this offering, we will have to sell more than 50% of shares in this offering or raise additional funding. The most likely source of future funds available to us is advances from our sole officer and director Mr. Wang, though we do not have an agreement from Mr. Wang for such cash advances. Product We intend to market and distribute various types of shower cabinets: simple showers, computerized showers, steam showers and massage showers cabinets. Our supplier has many years of manufacturing experience which enables them to produce reliable and quality products. The shower cabinets are made from internationally recognized equipment and environmentally protected materials such as ABS boards, aluminum alloy frames, tempered glass, and computerized panels. Our supplier has implemented quality control system that meets and exceeds many international standards. The shower cabinets vary in dimensions from shower corners that start from 80x80x195cm in size, which can fit small bathrooms, to large enclosures as large as 120x120x220cm for larger bathrooms. Our clients will also have the option to order, custom fitted and oversized shower cabins. We also plan to offer high-end customized shower cabins that include many functions such as: - computer controller - luxurious hi-fi effect FM radio - an exhaust fan - top shower and top light - foot massage - hands-free telephone receiving - ozone antisepsis & sterilization - massage shower system - spraying nozzles - 5mm of toughened glass - All of these shower cabins are made from environmental friendly materials such as ABS boards and satin chrome aluminum.

Our Supplier Our supplier, Hangzhou Yongsheng Holdings Co., Ltd was founded in 1993, and manufactures various types of shower products including shower enclosures, assembled showers rooms, simple showers, computerized showers, steam showers and massage showers cabinets. There are many manufacturers of shower cabinets in China as its cheap labor and sufficient raw material make the Chinese shower cabinets market very competitive. We intend to market and distribute the shower cabinets in the North American market to developers, contractors, homebuilders, chain and retail stores and distributors of sanitary ware. 20 | Page If Hangzhou Yongsheng Holdings Co., Ltd decreased, modified or terminated its association with us for any other reason, we would suffer an interruption in our business until we found a substitute for that supplier. If we were unable to find a substitute for that supplier, our business would likely fail. We cannot predict what the likelihood would be of finding an acceptable substitute supplier.

Sales and Marketing Strategy We intend to enter into agreements with numerous contractors and homebuilders who can order custom sized shower enclosures and cabins for condominium buildings and individual homes. We also will offer our product to larger home restoration stores that have a high volume of customer traffic. Our competitive advantage is that we offer a high quality product, with various stylish designs, while maintaining reasonable prices. Our supplier has a high-level of productivity, updated machinery and stringent quality control system, all of which should earn our product an image of high quality and reliability. 21 | Page Initially, our director, Liang Wei Wang will market our products. If we sell more than 50% of shares in this offering, we intend to hire one salesperson with good knowledge and connections in the sanitary ware distribution and construction industry to introduce our product. The salespersons job would be to find new potential purchasers, and to set up agreements with them to buy our shower cabinets. We intend to focus on direct marketing efforts whereby our representative will directly contact: * distributors that are responsible for marketing and selling sanitary ware to plumbing stores; * contractors and homebuilders; * bathroom suppliers and installers; and * retail outlets such as home restoration stores. These distributors, stores, installers, contractors and homebuilders will be asked to sell our products to consumers. We will provide them with a shower cabinet inventory at wholesale prices. They will then sell them to consumers at retail prices, which are typically 25%-30% higher than wholesale prices. Competition There are few barriers of entry in the shower cabinet distribution business and level of competition is extremely high. There are many domestic and international distributors. We will be in direct competition with them. Many large distribution companies have greater financial capabilities than us and will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers. Many of these companies may have a greater, more established customer base than us. We will likely lose business to such companies. Also, many of these companies will be able to afford to offer greater rental price than us which may also cause us to lose business. Insurance We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations. Employees; Identification of Certain Significant Employees. We have no employees other than our sole officer and director, Liang Wei Wang who currently devotes approximately twenty hours per week to company matters. We intend to hire employees on an as needed basis. Offices Our business office is located at 8 Jiang gang Qu, Ste 402, Hangzhou, China 310000.

We do not pay any rent to Mr. Wang and there is no agreement to pay any rent in the future. Upon the completion of our offering, we intend to establish an office elsewhere. As of the date of this prospectus, we have not sought or selected a new office sight.

Unless otherwise indicated, the stockholder listed possesses sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown. Title of Class Name and Address of Beneficial Owner Amount and Nature of Beneficial Ownership Percentage Common Stock Liang Wei Wang 8 Jiang gang Qu, Ste 402, Hangzhou, China 310000 2,500,000 shares of common stock (direct) 100 % (1) A beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the persons actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on April 30, 2011. As of April 30, 2011, there were 2,500,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION Advento, Inc. has 2,500,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus. The Company is registering an additional of 2,000,000 shares of its common stock for sale at the price of $0.05 per share. There is no arrangement to address the possible effect of the offering on the price of the stock. In connection with the Companys selling efforts in the offering, Liang Wei Wang will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Exchange Act, but rather will rely upon the safe harbor provisions of SEC Rule 3a4-1, promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Generally speaking, Rule 3a4-1 provides an exemption from the broker-dealer registration requirements of the Exchange Act for persons associated with an issuer that participate in an offering of the issuers securities. Mr. Wang is not subject to any statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act.

Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange or quoted over-the-counter, we intend to seek to have our shares of common stock quoted on the Over-the Counter Bulletin Board. In order to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved.

CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES We have not issued and do not have any outstanding securities convertible into shares of our common stock or any rights convertible or exchangeable into shares of our common stock.

We have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by one of our director, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our legal counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit the question of whether such indemnification is against public policy to a court of appropriate jurisdiction. We will then be governed by the courts decision.

Henderson, Nevada I have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Advento, Inc. (a development stage company) as of April 30, 2011, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the period from August 4, 2010 (inception) through April 30, 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion. In my opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Advento, Inc. as of April 30, 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from August 4, 2010 (inception) through April 30, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements the Company has suffered a loss from operations and has limited working capital that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

(A Development Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements April 30, 2011 1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS ADVENTO, INC. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on August 4, 2010. We are a development stage company and intend to commence operations in the distribution of shower cabinets. The Company is in the development stage as defined under Accounting Codification Standard, Development Stage Entities (ASC-915). The Company has not generated any revenue to date and consequently its operations are subject to all risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise. For the period from inception on August 4, 2010 through April 30, 2011 the Company has accumulated losses of $179. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. Going Concern The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $179 as of April 30, 2011 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and or private placement of common stock. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In managements opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods have been made, and all adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. F-6 35 | Page Foreign Currency Translation The Company's functional currency and its reporting currency is the United States dollar. Financial Instruments The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments approximates their fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Stock-based Compensation Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the assets and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share The Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC-260, Earnings per Share which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company has no potential dilutive instruments and accordingly basic loss and diluted loss per share are equal. Fiscal Periods The Company's fiscal year end is April 30. Recent accounting pronouncements We have reviewed all the recent accounting pronouncements issued to date of the issuance of these financial statements, and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the company. F-7 36 | Page Revenue Recognition The Company will recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 605, Revenue recognition ("ASC-605"), ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.
