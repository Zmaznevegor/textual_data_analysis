Our named executive officers for fiscal 2011 are:  Daniel P. McGahn, President and Chief Executive Officer;  Gregory J. Yurek, who was our Chief Executive Officer until May 31, 2011 and Chairman until August 15, 2011;  David A. Henry, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer;  Timothy Poor, Executive Vice President, Sales, Business Development and Wind Segment;  Susan J. DiCecco, Senior Vice President, Corporate Administration;  Charles W. Stankiewicz, who was our Executive Vice President, Operations and Grid Segment, until August 23, 2011; and.  Angelo R. Santamaria, who was our Senior Vice President, Global Manufacturing Operations, until August 12, 2011. In this CD&A, we first provide an executive summary of our program for fiscal 2011. We then describe our compensation philosophy and the objectives of our executive compensation program and how the Compensation Committee of our Board oversees our compensation program. We discuss the compensation determination process and describe how we determine each element of compensation. Executive Summary Overview of Our Executive Compensation Program The Compensation Committee of our Board has designed our executive compensation program to attract and retain superior employees in key positions to enable our company to succeed in the highly competitive market for talent, while simultaneously maximizing stockholder value. We intend to continue to provide a competitive compensation package to our executives, tie a significant portion of pay to performance and utilize components that best align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. The following is a summary of important aspects of our executive compensation program discussed later in this CD&A: Key Elements of Our Compensation Program. Our compensation program is designed to achieve these objectives through a combination of the following types of compensation:  Base salary;  Performance-based annual cash bonuses;  Long-term equity incentives; and  Severance and change-in-control benefits. 3 Table of Contents Each element of our executive compensation program is discussed in greater detail below.  We Intend to Pay for Performance. A significant portion of our named executive officers total compensation, as shown below, ties compensation directly to the achievement of corporate and individual objectives. We emphasize pay for performance in order to align executive compensation with our business strategy and the creation of long-term stockholder value.  Our Compensation Program Supports Our Corporate Objectives and Stockholder Interests. Our compensation program is designed to align executive officer compensation with our short- and long-term business objectives and building long-term stockholder value by rewarding successful execution of our business plan and by tying a portion of total compensation opportunities to equity incentives. Overview of Fiscal 2011 Performance Fiscal 2011 has been a very difficult year for our company. Toward the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2011, we discovered what we believe to be the theft of certain of our intellectual property by Sinovel Wind Group Co. Ltd., or Sinovel, who up until then was our largest customer, but was refusing to accept deliveries of contracted shipments. This discovery changed our managements view regarding Sinovel continuing as a customer, and as a result, we undertook significant cost reduction actions in fiscal 2011. We have not yet finalized the analysis of our performance for fiscal 2011. Upon completion of such analysis, we intend to further review our actual performance and its relationship to the compensation of the named executive officers. Fiscal 2011 Compensation Programs and Decisions In line with our executive compensation programs emphasis on pay for performance, compensation awarded to our named executive officers for fiscal 2011 reflected our financial results and overall compensation philosophy:  Adjustments to Base Salary. During fiscal 2011, our named executive officers received increases to their base salaries based on factors such as the level of job responsibility, individual, business unit and overall company performance, and competitiveness with salaries paid to executive officers in similar positions, industries and geographic locations.  Performance-Based Annual Cash Bonuses. For fiscal 2011, our company primarily focused on decreasing Non-GAAP Net Loss (as such performance measure is described in more detail below), operating loss and operating expense and increasing revenues, cash flows and orders. Our compensation program for fiscal 2011 was designed to support our companys focus on these performance measures. For our annual bonus program for fiscal 2011, the Compensation Committee selected these objectives as key corporate objectives because the Compensation Committee believes they encourage executives to achieve superior operating results.  Long-Term Equity Incentive. The Compensation Committee granted long-term equity awards to our named executive officers in fiscal 2011 based on such factors as performance and contribution during the prior fiscal year, recommendations made by our management, competitive practices, and the overall compensation package for each executive officer. The company has not yet finalized its analysis with respect to performance during fiscal 2011, and will conduct further review of the named executive officers fiscal 2011 compensation following finalization of such analysis. Compensation Program Philosophy and Objectives The Compensation Committee of our Board oversees our executive compensation program, pursuant to authority established in the Compensation Committee Charter. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves all compensation decisions relating to our executive officers, except for the chief executive officer. The Compensation Committee reviews the compensation for our chief executive officer and makes a recommendation to our Board, and our Board determines the compensation of our chief executive officer. 4 Table of Contents Our executive compensation program is designed to meet three principal objectives:  Attract and retain executive officers who contribute to our long-term success;  Align compensation with our short- and long-term business objectives; and  Motivate the executive officers to provide superior performance that will build long-term stockholder value. These objectives collectively seek to link executive compensation to our overall company performance, which helps to ensure that the interests of our executives are aligned with the interests of our stockholders. The Compensation Committees decisions regarding executive compensation during fiscal 2011 were based on achieving the above objectives, with an emphasis on:  Increasing long-term stockholder value by decreasing net loss before amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, restructuring and impairments, stock-based compensation expense, other unusual charges and any tax effects related to these items, which we refer to as Non-GAAP Loss;  Improving operational performance by increasing revenue, operating income, cash flow and orders and decreasing operating expense;  Taking into account the nature and scope of the executive officers position and responsibilities, including considerations of pay equity among the executive officers; and  Providing compensation opportunities that are competitive in the marketplace. In setting executive compensation for fiscal 2011, the Compensation Committee established salary levels, approved annual equity awards and established an executive incentive cash bonus plan with performance metrics that reflected our annual operating plan and strategic priorities for fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2011, the Compensation Committee established Non-GAAP Net Loss and individualized objectives relating to revenue, operating expense, operating loss, cash flow, orders and internal customer service measurements, to promote our short-term and long-term business success. In setting objectives for each of the foregoing metrics, the Compensation Committee considered multiple factors so that its decisions were informed and equitable and that our executive compensation program achieved its objectives. Stockholder Say-On-Pay Votes At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on December 8, 2011, we provided our stockholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on executive compensation, and in future years such advisory vote will occur triennially. Over 95% of the votes cast on this say on pay vote were voted in favor of the proposal. We have considered the results of such vote and believe the support of our stockholders for the vote proposal indicates that our stockholders are generally supportive of our approach to executive compensation. Thus we did not make changes to our executive compensation arrangements in response to the vote. In the future, we will continue to consider the outcome of our say on pay votes when making compensation decisions regarding our named executive officers. The Compensation Committees Process The Compensation Committee has a process to help ensure that our executive compensation program meets its principal objectives. In making compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee considers a wide variety of information, including how each compensation decision ties to its total compensation philosophy, the advice of our senior vice president, corporate administration, and the thoughts of our chief executive officer and other Board members. Our senior vice president, corporate administration regularly attends Compensation Committee meetings to provide information and recommendations regarding our executive compensation program. Among other things, she performs extensive analysis of marketplace practices for executive pay, makes recommendations to our chief executive officer on compensation matters for all officers (other than herself) and compiles other relevant data at the request of the Compensation Committee. 5 Table of Contents Our chief executive officer is actively involved in the executive compensation process. Our chief executive officer reviews the performance of each of the executive officers (other than his own) and makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding the salary and long-term incentive awards for executive officers other than himself, as well as the executive compensation programs impact on attracting, retaining and motivating the level of executive talent necessary to achieve and exceed our company goals. The Compensation Committee is not bound by such recommendations, but generally takes them into consideration before making final determinations about the compensation of executive officers other than our chief executive officer. The Compensation Committee reviews the compensation for our chief executive officer and makes a recommendation to the full Board. The full Board determines the compensation of our chief executive officer. The Compensation Committee also considers information relevant to each executives specific situation including the executives marketability and the availability or scarcity of other qualified candidates, inside and outside our company, who could replace the executive should he or she leave the Company. In determining equity compensation, the Compensation Committee considers levels of past performance, performance potential, retention risk and the value of the equity compensation needed to keep the total compensation opportunity level competitive and consistent with our compensation philosophy. Role of Independent Compensation Consultant. The Compensation Committee engaged Pearl Meyer & Partners in 2008 as its independent outside compensation consultant, to advise it and develop an executive compensation strategy, to assess the competitiveness of our executive compensation and to provide recommendations with respect to both the levels and structure of compensation for our executives. Pearl Meyer & Partners assessed the competitiveness of executive compensation through comparisons with peer groups and survey sources while additionally assessing our performance to ensure compensation levels were appropriately tied to performance. With the assistance of Pearl Meyer & Partners, in June 2011, the Compensation Committee reviewed the compensation levels of our executive officers against compensation levels at peer group companies that were selected based on the following criteria:  companies whose product and service offerings are similar, though not necessarily identical, to ours;  companies with revenues of approximately one-third to three times our revenues, of which approximately 67% have higher revenues and 33% have lower revenues than we had (at the time of selection in February 2011); and  companies with market capitalization of approximately one-fourth to four times our market capitalization, of which 20% have a higher market capitalization and 80% have a lower market capitalization than we had (at the time of selection in February 2011). For the analysis of our fiscal 2011 executive compensation packages, the peer group was approved by the Compensation Committee in fiscal 2011 and consisted of the following fifteen companies: Peer Group Companies Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. Kaydon Corporation AZZ, Inc. Microsemi Corporation Cirrus Logic, Inc. National Instruments Corporation EnerNOC, Inc. Powell Industries, Inc. ESCO Technologies, Inc. Power-One, Inc. Generac Holdings, Inc. SunPower Corporation GT Solar International, Inc. ITC Holdings Corporation Vicor Corporation 6 Table of Contents The selection criteria and peer group companies are reviewed each year by the Compensation Committee and may change from year to year depending on changes in the marketplace, acquisitions, divestitures and business focus of us and/or our peer group companies. In order to perform the analysis of our fiscal 2011 compensation, our Compensation Committee added nine new companies, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., Cirrus Logic, Inc., ESCO Technologies, Inc., Generac Holdings, Inc., GT Solar International, Inc., Kaydon Corporation, Microsemi Corporation, National Instruments Corporation and Power-One, Inc., to our peer group, and removed eight companies, Broadwind Energy, Inc., Comverge, Inc., Echelon Corporation, Energy Conversion Devices, Inc., Evergreen Solar, Inc., FuelCell Energy, Inc., SatCon Technology Corporation and Zoltek Companies, Inc., from our peer group. These changes were made in order to maintain closer similarity between us and our peer group companies based upon the comparable company criteria described above. The Compensation Committee utilized the peer group to provide context for its compensation decision-making. The compensation paid by peer group companies to their respective executive officers does not factor into the Compensation Committees determination of the peer group. After the peer group companies are selected, Pearl Meyer & Partners prepares and presents a report to the Compensation Committee summarizing the competitive data and comparisons of our executive officers to the comparable company market data utilizing publicly available data from the comparable companies and broad survey data (reflecting companies of similar size in the general and high-technology industries). We use the broad survey data in conjunction with peer group data in evaluating our executive compensation practices. Survey data sources include the CHiPS Executive and Senior Management Total Compensation Survey and Towers Watsons Top Management Compensation Survey. The Compensation Committee does not rely upon data from any individual company participating in any of these surveys in making compensation decisions and uses the general survey data as only a reference point for evaluating our executive compensation practices, as opposed to benchmarking our executive compensation practices against the general survey data. Each of our elements of compensation is reviewed as part of this analysis and evaluation. The above review provided the Compensation Committee with general affirmation that its compensation decisions are aligned with the marketplace and our compensation program was achieving the Compensation Committees objectives, as described above. During early fiscal 2011, Pearl Meyer & Partners advised the Compensation Committee on compensation matters for all officers and directors and met with the Compensation Committee in executive session without the presence of management, as requested by the Compensation Committee. Pearl Meyer & Partners did not perform services for the Company that were unrelated to Compensation Committee-related matters during fiscal 2011. Risk Considerations in our Compensation Program Our Compensation Committee does not believe that any risks arising from our employee compensation policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse affect on our company. Our Compensation Committee believes that any risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are mitigated by:  the multiple elements of our compensation packages, including base salary, annual bonus programs and, for many of our employees, equity awards vesting over multiple years, that are intended to motivate employees to take a long-term view of our business;  the structure of our annual cash bonus program, which is based on (i) a number of different performance measures (including Non-GAAP Net Loss, revenue, operating expense, operating income, cash flow, orders and internal customer service measurements), to avoid employees placing undue emphasis on any particular performance metric at the expense of other aspects of our business, and (ii) performance targets that we believe are somewhat aggressive yet reasonable and should not require undue risk-taking to achieve; and  management process, controls and decision authorities established for different types and levels of decisions. 7 Table of Contents Compensation Mix The Compensation Committee relies upon its judgment and not upon rigid guidelines or formulas in determining the amount and mix of compensation elements for each executive officer. We seek to achieve our executive compensation objectives through the use of four compensation components, which are summarized in the table below. Compensation Component Principal Contributions to Compensation Objectives Comments Base salary  Attracts and retains talented executives with annual salary that reflects the executives performance, skill set and opportunities in the marketplace.  Only component of compensation that is guaranteed.  Can be most influenced by individual performance. Performance-based annual cash bonuses  Focuses executives on annual financial and operating results.  Links compensation to stockholder interests.  Enables total cash compensation to remain competitive within the marketplace for executive talent.  0% to 156% of target payout can be achieved. Long-term equity incentives  Retains a successful and tenured management team.  Time-based stock options and restricted stock. Severance and change-in-control benefits  Helps to attract and retain talented executives with benefits that are comparable to those offered by companies with whom we compete for talent.  Incentivizes management to maximize stockholder value.  Each severance agreement provides for certain severance benefits, primarily salary, health benefits and, in certain cases, prorated cash bonus, in the event that the executives employment is terminated under certain circumstances. The severance periods (other than for Dr. Yurek) range from 12 months to 24 months.  The stock options and restricted stock awards we grant to our executive officers provide for full acceleration of vesting upon a change in control of our company. While the Compensation Committee independently evaluates each of the compensation components discussed in the above table, it places greater emphasis on the sum of base salary, performance-based annual cash bonuses and long-term equity incentives rather than any one component because of their combined greater potential to influence our named executive officers performance. The Compensation Committee believes, and our pay mix is designed to reflect, that a substantial portion of the compensation for our named executive officers should be at risk and aligned with our stockholders interests. Base salary Base salaries are set once per year as part of the compensation review process. The Compensation Committee assessed a number of factors in determining base salary adjustments for our executive officers for fiscal 2011 including:  level of job responsibility;  individual, business unit and overall company performance; and  competitiveness with salaries paid to executive officers in similar positions, industries and geographic locations. 8 Table of Contents Based on its assessment of the foregoing factors, together with its own business experience and judgment, the Compensation Committee approved the changes below to the annual base salaries of our executive officers, other than our chief executive officer, effective as of May 1. David A. Henry - increased from $295,000 to $306,000. Timothy D. Poor - increased from $240,000 to $290,000. Susan J. DiCecco - increased from $225,000 to $242,000. Charles W. Stankiewicz - increased from $321,000 to $345,000. Angelo R. Santamaria - increased from $240,000 to $250,000. In addition, on May 23, 2011, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved, an increase to Mr. McGahns base salary from $330,000 to $480,000, effective June 1, 2011, in connection with his promotion to chief executive officer of the Company. Dr. Yurek did not receive an increase to his base salary of $600,000 in fiscal 2011. The following table reflects a comparison of the fiscal 2010 base salary and fiscal 2011 base salary received by each named executive officer and the relative change from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011.

(2) Reflects the fiscal 2011 annual base salary received by Dr. Yurek and Messrs. Stankiewicz and Santamaria prior to termination of their employment. (3) Mr. Henrys base salary is $306,000. The amount actually received is in excess of his base salary due to an additional work day during a leap year at his new base salary. Cash Promotion Bonus In June 2011, Mr. McGahn received a cash promotion bonus in the amount of $100,000 in connection with his promotion to chief executive officer of our company. Performance-Based Annual Cash Bonuses The Compensation Committee believes cash bonuses are an important factor in rewarding and motivating our executive officers. The Compensation Committee establishes a cash incentive plan for our executive officers on an annual basis, typically early in the fiscal year. On August 9, 2011, the Compensation Committee, and on August 10, 2011, our Board, approved an executive incentive plan for fiscal 2011 covering all of our executive officers. Under the plan, the Compensation Committee established Non-GAAP Net Loss; individualized objectives relating to revenue, operating expense, operating income, cash flow, orders and internal customer service measurements; and individual contributions to our financial and non-financial objectives as the performance metrics for the payment of cash bonus awards for fiscal 2011. For each executive officer, the Compensation Committee assigned the following weighting to each such metric:  our companys Non-GAAP Net Loss for fiscal 2011 as compared to the established target  40%; 9 Table of Contents  the executives achievement of individual measurable objectives during fiscal 2011 as determined by our Board (in the case of our chief executive officer) or the Compensation Committee, which varied among the executive officers  40%; and  the executives overall contribution during fiscal 2011 toward the achievement of our companys financial and non-financial objectives  20%. Under the terms of the fiscal 2011 executive incentive plan, the Compensation Committee designated for each named executive officer a target cash bonus amount between 50% and 100% of such named executive officers then current base salary. After final determination of fiscal 2011 performance with respect to the quantitative objectives, the amount of the target cash bonus award to be paid to each named executive officer may be less than or greater than the executives target cash bonus incentive, with the amount capped at 156% of the target cash bonus amount. If less than a specified percentage, generally 80%, of a particular quantitative objective is achieved, no payment is expected to be received with respect to that component of the bonus plan. The following table sets forth each named executive officers target cash bonus for fiscal 2011: Name Target Cash Bonus as% of Base Salary Target Cash Bonus Daniel P. McGahn 100 % $ 480,000 Gregory J. Yurek (1)   David A. Henry 50 % $ 153,000 Timothy D. Poor 75 % $ 217,500 Susan J. DiCecco 50 % $ 121,000 Charles W. Stankiewicz (1)   Angelo R. Santamaria (1)   (1) Dr. Yurek, Mr. Stankiewicz and Mr. Santamaria were not participants in the fiscal 2011 executive incentive plan and were not eligible to receive a performance-based cash bonus payment with respect to fiscal 2011. The Compensation Committee is responsible for determining the cash payout under the plan to each executive officer other than the chief executive officer. Our Board determines the cash payout under the plan for the chief executive officer, taking into account the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. The following summarizes the cash bonus opportunity for the named executive officers under each performance metric under the fiscal 2011 executive incentive plan. Milestones and achievement for the Non-GAAP Net Loss (40%) bonus measure: All of the named executive officers had the same Non-GAAP Net Loss threshold that had to be met before payout could be earned. The fiscal 2011 milestones and achievement levels for our companys Non-GAAP Net Loss measure are shown below. An executives payout on this measure will be determined through a numerical calculation based on our companys Non-GAAP Net Loss so the Compensation Committee (or, in the case of our chief executive officer, our Board) does not expect to need to apply discretion. Fiscal 2011 Milestones and Achievement for Company Non-GAAP Net Loss Threshold (80%) Target (100%) Maximum (156%) Non-GAAP Net Loss Non-GAAP Net Loss Milestones: ($ 117.4M ) ($ 105.7M ) ($ 32.5M ) 10 Table of Contents Our companys Non-GAAP Net Loss for fiscal 2011 will be determined upon the completion of the annual audit of our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm, which we anticipate will occur by late May 2012. As a result, the Compensation Committee (or, in the case of our chief executive officer, our Board) has not yet determined whether bonuses under the Non-GAAP Net Loss measure will be awarded to any named executive officer. Each named executive officer is eligible to receive a target bonus award for this metric as summarized in the following: Name Target Bonus for Metric Daniel P. McGahn $ 192,000 Gregory J.

Santamaria $  Individual measurable objectives (40%): A cash bonus payment to each named executive officer under this measure depends upon achievement of performance objectives specific to each named executive officer. These performance objectives were established at the beginning of fiscal 2011 and relate specifically to each officers function and department. The Compensation Committee (or, in the case of our chief executive officer, our Board) has not yet determined whether bonuses under this measure will be awarded to any named executive officer.

Assessment of achievement for these objectives will be evaluated on the basis of a number of pre-determined factors relating to outcomes, timing, process, communication and leadership. The Compensation Committee (or, in the case of our chief executive officer, our Board) has discretionary authority to determine whether, and to what extent, these objectives have been achieved, but has not yet made such determination. As a result, the Compensation Committee (or, in the case of our chief executive officer, our Board) has not yet determined whether bonuses under this subjective measure will be awarded to any named executive officer.

Long Term Equity Incentives The Compensation Committee uses stock-based awards to retain executive officers and align their interests with those of our stockholders. Historically, the Compensation Committee granted stock-based awards to our executive officers purely in the form of stock options that vested in installments over multiple years, with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. While we continue to use stock options as a form of incentive for employees and executive officers, the Compensation Committee has increasingly relied on the award of shares of restricted stock to our executive officers. The Compensation Committee awards both time-based and performance-based restricted stock awards. A time-based restricted stock award typically will vest in equal annual installments over a three-year period. A performance-based restricted stock award typically will vest upon the achievement of specific objectives relating to our performance within a specified period. The Compensation Committee believes shares of restricted stock provide an equally motivating form of incentive compensation, minimize stock compensation expenses and reduce the potential dilution of our shares. We generally grant options and shares of restricted stock to executive officers and other employees upon their initial hire, in connection with a promotion, and annually based on merit. To determine the amount of stock-based awards granted to executive officers, our Compensation Committee considers the performance of the individual and our company, historic stock-based awards and the awards made to those in similar positions at comparable companies. Our Board and Compensation Committee typically meet in early May to review company performance for the prior fiscal year. At such time, the Compensation Committee (or, in the case of our chief executive officer, our 12 Table of Contents Board) also reviews the performance of the executive officers over the prior fiscal year and grants restricted stock or stock options to the executive officers. In fiscal 2011, the Board and Compensation Committee met after our company became current in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 23, 2011. In September 2011, when considering equity grants, the Compensation Committee considered:  each executive officers performance and contribution during the prior fiscal year;  recommendations made by our management;  competitive practices; and  the overall compensation package for each executive officer. Based on such considerations, the Compensation Committee granted time-based restricted stock awards and stock options. Messrs. Henry and Poor each received time-based restricted stock awards for 25,000 shares, each of which vest in full on June 24, 2014. Ms. DiCecco received a time-based restricted stock award for 18,000 shares, which vests in equal annual installments over a three-year period. Messrs. Henry and Poor and Ms. DiCecco also received option grants for 42,000, 45,000 and 30,000 shares, respectively, with each grant becoming exercisable in equal annual installments over a three-year period. Mr. McGahn had received a time-based restricted stock award of 60,000 shares and an option grant for 90,000 shares, each of which vests in equal annual installments over a three-year period, in connection with his promotion to chief executive officer in May 2011 and, as a result, he did not receive any additional restricted stock awards or option grants in September 2011. Benefits We offer a comprehensive benefits package to all full-time employees, including health and dental insurance, life and disability insurance and a 401(k) plan. Executive officers are eligible to participate in all of our employee benefit plans. The 401(k) plan includes a matching component where we will match $0.50 on each dollar of an employees contribution up to a maximum of 6 percent of his or her wages in the form of our stock. The employee contributions are subject to the maximum limitations as set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Severance and Change-in-Control Benefits We have entered into agreements with each of our executive officers that provide them with severance benefits in the event of the termination of their employment under specified circumstances, including termination following a change in control of our company. In addition, the stock options and restricted stock awards we grant to our executive officers provide for full acceleration of vesting upon a change in control of our company. These agreements, along with estimates of the value of the benefits payable under them, are described below under the caption Employment Agreements and Severance Agreements with Executive Officers. We believe providing these benefits helps us compete for and retain executive talent and that our severance and change-in-control benefits are generally in line with those provided to executives by comparable companies. Tax Considerations The Internal Revenue Service, pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally disallows a tax deduction for compensation in excess of $1,000,000 paid to our chief executive officer and to certain other officers (other than our chief financial officer). Certain compensation, including qualified performance-based compensation, will not be subject to the deduction limit if certain requirements are met. We generally structure our stock option awards to comply with exemptions in Section 162(m) so that the compensation remains tax deductible to us. We periodically review the potential consequences of Section 162(m) on the other components of our executive compensation program. We generally will structure arrangements to comply with the Section 162(m) exceptions where we believe it to be feasible. However, the Compensation Committee may, in its judgment, authorize compensation payments that do not comply with the exemptions in Section 162(m) when it believes that such payments are appropriate to attract and retain executive talent or is otherwise in the best interests of the Company. 13 Table of Contents Summary Compensation Table The following table contains information with respect to the compensation for fiscal 2011 of our principal executive officer, our former principal executive officer, our principal financial officer, our other remaining two executive officers who were serving as executive officers on March 31, 2012 and two additional individuals who served as executive officers during part of fiscal 2011 for whom disclosure is required pursuant to SEC rules.

Employment Agreements and Severance Agreements with Executive Officers We are party to severance agreements with each of our executive officers. Each severance agreement provides for certain severance benefits from the Company to the executive in the event that such executives employment is terminated:  by us without cause (other than due to death or disability) in the absence of a change in control of the Company (as such terms are defined in the severance agreement); or  by us without cause (other than due to death or disability) or by the executive for good reason (as defined in the severance agreement) within 12 months following a change in control of the Company; or  by us without cause (other than due to death or disability) more than 12 months following a change in control of the Company (each such termination referenced herein as a qualifying termination). These benefits consist primarily of the continuation of the executives salary and employee benefits for a specified period of time following employment termination. These periods are as follows: Mr. McGahn  24 months; Dr. Yurek  36 months; Mr. Henry  18 months; Mr. Poor  12 months; and Ms. DiCecco  12 months. In addition upon termination by us without cause (other than due to death or disability) or by the executive for good reason within 12 months following a change in control of the Company, the terminated executive is also entitled to lump sum payment equal to a prorated portion of his or her bonus for the year of termination. The stock options and restricted stock awards we grant to our executive officers provide for full acceleration of vesting upon a change in control of our company. Except with respect to Dr. Yurek and Messrs. Stankiewicz and Santamaria, whose severance terms are described more fully below, the following table describes the potential payments and benefits that would be received by the named executive officers pursuant to these severance agreements, assuming that a qualifying termination of employment occurred on March 31, 2012. Actual amounts payable to each executive listed below upon his employment termination can only be determined definitively at the time of an executives actual termination.

In fiscal 2011, the Compensation Committee engaged Pearl Meyer & Partners, our independent outside compensation consultants, to assess the competitiveness of our director compensation and to provide recommendations with respect to both the levels and structure of compensation for our directors. Pearl Meyer & Partners assessed the competitiveness of director compensation through comparisons with peer groups and recommended (i) an increase to the annual cash retainer, and (ii) that the annual equity award be based on a value approach with a specific targeted monetary value. In May 2011, the Compensation Committee considered Pearl Meyer & Partnerss recommendations, but in light of the events at that time, determined that it was not an appropriate time to make a change to the director compensation arrangement. In August 2011, when our chairman, Dr. Yurek retired, our company elected to separate the positions of chairman of the Board and chief executive officer. The Compensation Committee engaged Pearl Meyer & Partners to provide information related to compensation practices for a non-employee director chairman. Based upon information provided by Pearl Meyer & Partners, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved, an additional annual cash retainer of $20,000 to be paid to our companys non-employee director chairman of the Board. Each fiscal year, non-employee directors receive cash compensation as follows:  each non-employee director receives $20,000 as an annual cash retainer;  the non-employee independent chairman of the Board receives an additional annual cash retainer of $20,000;  the chairman of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee receive an additional annual cash retainer of $6,000, $4,000 and $3,000, respectively; and  each non-employee director who attends an in person meeting of the Board or a committee of the Board receives $1,500 per meeting; and each non-employee director who participates in a teleconference meeting of the Board or a committee of the Board receives $1,000 per meeting. Pursuant to the 2007 Director Stock Plan, non-employee directors are granted equity awards as follows:  each non-employee director is granted an option to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock upon his or her initial election to our Board; and  each non-employee director is granted (for no cash consideration) 3,000 fully-vested shares of common stock three business days following each Annual Meeting of the Stockholders, provided that such non-employee director had served as a director for at least one year. Each option granted under the 2007 Director Stock Plan has an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and becomes exercisable in equal annual installments over a two-year period. Those options become exercisable in full in the event of an acquisition of the Company. The term of each option granted under the 2007 Director Stock Plan is 10 years, provided that, in general, an option may be exercised only while the director continues to serve as a director or within 60 days thereafter. The compensation packages for directors are intended to attract and retain high-quality individuals to provide oversight to our management team. Directors who are employees of the Company receive no additional compensation for their service as directors. 21 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the compensation of our non-employee directors during fiscal 2011: Name* Fees Earned or Paid in Cash Stock Awards(1)(2) Option Awards All Other Compensation Total Vikram S.

We paid the selling stockholder $100,000 to reimburse its legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction. Accordingly, the net proceeds to us were $24.9 million. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to, among other things, (i) not issue any securities until January 4, 2013, subject to certain exceptions, (ii) not to enter into a variable rate transaction at any time while the Notes are outstanding, and (iii) for a period of two years from the date of the Purchase Agreement, to allow the selling stockholder to participate in future financing transactions. Description of the Notes We are required to repay the Notes in monthly installments of approximately $926,000 commencing August 4, 2014 and ending October 4, 2014. We refer to each such date as an Installment Date. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 7% per annum. Interest is computed on the basis of a 360-day year and twelve 30-day months and is compounded monthly. The interest rate will increase to 15% per annum upon the occurrence of an event of default pursuant to the Notes. Interest on the Notes is payable in arrears on each Installment Date. We may pay the applicable principal and interest amounts due on an Installment Date in shares of common stock, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, or elect to pay in cash. Among these conditions, (i) there must be an effective registration statement covering the shares of our common stock issuable under the terms of the Notes and the Warrant or such shares of common stock must be eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act without the need for registration, (ii) the aggregate dollar trading volume of our common stock on at least 25 of the 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Installment Date is at least $1,500,000, and (iii) the average of the daily VWAP of our common stock over the previous 30 consecutive trading days is at least $2.50. If we are not permitted to deliver shares of common stock with respect to an Installment Date due to a failure to satisfy any of the conditions, we must pay the applicable portion of the principal and interest amounts in cash, unless the conditions are waived by the selling stockholder. If the applicable conditions are satisfied, we currently intend to repay the Notes through the issuance of shares of our common stock. However, this intention may change depending on our finances at the time of the applicable Installment Date and our stock price on the applicable Installment Date. If we make a payment in shares of common stock, the principal amount of the Notes being paid will be converted into shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the lesser of the Conversion Price then in effect (as described below) and 85% of the Market Price on the Installment Date. The Market Price for any given date is the lesser of (i) the volume-weighted average price of our common stock on the trading day immediately preceding such date, and (ii) the arithmetic average of the volume-weighted average price of our common stock for the ten consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding such date. All amounts due under the Notes are convertible at any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the selling stockholder, into shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to $4.85, subject to certain price-based and other anti-dilution adjustments, or the Conversion Price. However, the Notes may not be converted if, after giving effect to the conversion, the selling stockholder together with its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, or the Maximum Percentage, or the issuance of the shares would violate NASDAQ rules and regulations (including applicable shareholder approval requirements). The Maximum Percentage may be raised to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% at the option of the selling stockholder, upon at least 61-days prior notice to us, or lowered to any other percentage, at the option of the selling stockholder, at any time. The Notes contain certain covenants and restrictions, including, among others, that, for so long as the Notes are outstanding, we will not incur any indebtedness (other than permitted indebtedness under the Notes), permit liens on our properties (other that permitted liens under the Notes), make payments on junior securities, make dividends or transfer certain assets. Events of default under the Notes include, among others, failure to pay principal or interest on the Notes or comply with certain covenants under the Notes and cross defaults to other material indebtedness. Upon an event of default, the selling stockholder may require us to redeem all or any portion of the 26 Table of Contents outstanding principal amount of the Notes in cash for a price equal to the greater of (a) either 120% or 100%, depending on the type of event of default, of the principal amount being redeemed and (b) the product of the principal amount being redeemed multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the greatest closing sale price of our common stock on any trading day during the period starting on the date immediately preceding the event of default and ending on the day we pay the redemption amount for the Notes, and the denominator of which is the Conversion Price at the time the selling stockholder elects to have the Notes redeemed. Warrants The Warrants is exercisable at any time on or after October 4, 2012 and entitle the selling stockholder to purchase shares of our common stock until October 4, 2017 at a price per share, equal to $5.45 per share, subject to certain price-based and other anti-dilution adjustments, or the Warrant Exercise Price. The Warrants may not be exercised if, after giving effect to the conversion, the selling stockholder together with its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of the Maximum Percentage of 4.99%. The Maximum Percentage may be raised to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% at the option of the holder of the selling stockholder, upon at least 61-days prior notice to us, or lowered to any other percentage, at the option of the selling stockholder, at any time. 27 Table of Contents SELLING STOCKHOLDER The shares of common stock being offered by the selling stockholder are those issuable to the selling stockholder upon conversion of the Notes, payment of principal of and interest on the Notes and exercise of the Warrant. We are registering the shares of common stock in order to permit the selling stockholder to offer the shares for resale from time to time. Except for the ownership of the Notes and the Warrant, the selling stockholder has not had any material relationship with us within the past three years. The table below lists the selling stockholder and other information regarding the beneficial ownership (as determined under Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder) of the shares of common stock held by the selling stockholder. The second column lists the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the selling stockholder, based on its ownership of shares of common stock, the Notes and the Warrant, as of April 4, 2012, assuming conversion of the Notes and exercise of the Warrant held by the selling stockholder on that date but taking account of any limitations on conversion and exercise set forth therein. The third column lists the shares of common stock being offered by this prospectus by the selling stockholder and does not take in account any limitations on (i) conversion of the Notes set forth therein or (ii) exercise of the Warrant set forth therein. In accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement with the holder of the Notes and the Warrant, this prospectus generally covers the resale of the sum of (i) up to 6,185,567 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, including conversion in connection with monthly principal payments on the Notes, (ii) up to 982,684 shares of common stock issuable upon payment of interest on the Note, and (iii) up to 3,094,060 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant. Because the price at which the Notes will be converted in connection with principal and interest payments will vary based on the market price of our common stock, and the conversion price of the Notes and the exercise price of the Warrants may be adjusted, the number of shares that will actually be issued may be more or less than the number of shares being offered by this prospectus. The fourth column assumes the sale of all of the shares offered by the selling stockholder pursuant to this prospectus. The selling stockholder may sell all, some or none of their shares in this offering. See Plan of Distribution. Name of Selling Stockholder Number of Shares of Common Stock Owned Prior to Offering Maximum Number of Shares of Common Stock to be Sold Pursuant to this Prospectus Number of Shares of Common Stock of Owned After Offering Capital Ventures International(1) 10,262,311 (1) 10,262,311 0 (1) Heights Capital Management, Inc., the authorized agent of Capital Ventures International, or CVI, has discretionary authority to vote and dispose of the shares held by CVI and may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of these shares. Martin Kobinger, in his capacity as Investment Manager of Heights Capital Management, Inc., may also be deemed to have investment discretion and voting power over the shares held by CVI. Mr. Kobinger disclaims any such beneficial ownership of the shares. CVI is affiliated with one or more registered broker-dealers, none of whom are currently expected to participate in the sale of the common stock offered hereby. CVI purchased the shares being registered hereunder in the ordinary course of business and at the time of purchase, had no agreements or understandings, directly or indirectly, with any other person to distribute such shares. Capital Ventures International is not deemed to be the beneficial owner of shares of common stock issuable upon payment of interest on the Notes, because we have the option to pay such amounts in cash. Based on the current Conversion Price for the Notes and the Exercise Price for the Warrants, as of the date of this prospectus, Capital Ventures International beneficially owns 8,248,700 shares of common stock. 28 Table of Contents PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We are registering the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes and exercise of the Warrants to permit the resale of these shares of common stock by the holders of the Notes and Warrants from time to time after the date of this prospectus. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale by the selling stockholder of the shares of common stock. We will bear all fees and expenses incident to our obligation to register the shares of common stock. The selling stockholder may sell all or a portion of the shares of common stock held by it and offered hereby from time to time directly or through one or more underwriters, broker-dealers or agents. If the shares of common stock are sold through underwriters or broker-dealers, the selling stockholder will be responsible for underwriting discounts or commissions or agents commissions. The shares of common stock may be sold in one or more transactions at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected in transactions, which may involve crosses or block transactions, pursuant to one or more of the following methods:  on any national securities exchange or quotation service on which the securities may be listed or quoted at the time of sale;  in the over-the-counter market;  in transactions otherwise than on these exchanges or systems or in the over-the-counter market;  through the writing or settlement of options, whether such options are listed on an options exchange or otherwise;  ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;  an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;  privately negotiated transactions;  short sales made after the date the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC;  broker-dealers may agree with a selling securityholder to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share;  a combination of any such methods of sale; and  any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. The selling stockholder may also sell shares of common stock under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, if available, rather than under this prospectus. In addition, the selling stockholder may transfer the shares of common stock by other means not described in this prospectus. If the selling stockholder effects such transactions by selling shares of common stock to or through underwriters, broker-dealers or agents, such underwriters, broker-dealers or agents may receive commissions in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling stockholder or commissions from purchasers of the shares of common stock for whom they may act as agent or to whom they may sell as principal (which discounts, concessions or 29 Table of Contents commissions as to particular underwriters, broker-dealers or agents may be in excess of those customary in the types of transactions involved). In connection with sales of the shares of common stock or otherwise, the selling stockholder may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers, which may in turn engage in short sales of the shares of common stock in the course of hedging in positions they assume. The selling stockholder may also sell shares of common stock short and deliver shares of common stock covered by this prospectus to close out short positions and to return borrowed shares in connection with such short sales. The selling stockholder may also loan or pledge shares of common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell such shares. The selling stockholder may pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the Notes, Warrants or shares of common stock owned by them and, if they default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the shares of common stock from time to time pursuant to this prospectus or any amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the Securities Act amending, if necessary, the list of selling stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling stockholders under this prospectus. The selling stockholder also may transfer and donate the shares of common stock in other circumstances in which case the transferees, donees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus. To the extent required by the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, the selling stockholder and any broker-dealer participating in the distribution of the shares of common stock may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act, and any commission paid, or any discounts or concessions allowed to, any such broker-dealer may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. At the time a particular offering of the shares of common stock is made, a prospectus supplement, if required, will be distributed, which will set forth the aggregate amount of shares of common stock being offered and the terms of the offering, including the name or names of any broker-dealers or agents, any discounts, commissions and other terms constituting compensation from the selling stockholder and any discounts, commissions or concessions allowed or re-allowed or paid to broker-dealers. Under the securities laws of some states, the shares of common stock may be sold in such states only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. In addition, in some states the shares of common stock may not be sold unless such shares have been registered or qualified for sale in such state or an exemption from registration or qualification is available and is complied with. There can be no assurance that the selling stockholder will sell any or all of the shares of common stock registered pursuant to the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part. The selling stockholder and any other person participating in such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, including, without limitation, to the extent applicable, Regulation M of the Exchange Act, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of any of the shares of common stock by the selling stockholder and any other participating person. To the extent applicable, Regulation M may also restrict the ability of any person engaged in the distribution of the shares of common stock to engage in market-making activities with respect to the shares of common stock. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the shares of common stock and the ability of any person or entity to engage in market-making activities with respect to the shares of common stock. We will pay all expenses of the registration of the shares of common stock pursuant to the registration rights agreement, estimated to be $90,000 in total, including, without limitation, Securities and Exchange Commission filing fees and expenses of compliance with state securities or blue sky laws; provided, however, the selling stockholder will pay all underwriting discounts and selling commissions, if any. We will indemnify the selling stockholder against liabilities, including some liabilities under the Securities Act in accordance with the registration rights agreements or the selling stockholder will be entitled to contribution. We may be indemnified by the selling stockholder against civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act that may arise from any written information furnished to us by the selling stockholder specifically for use in this prospectus, in accordance with the related registration rights agreements or we may be entitled to contribution. 30 Table of Contents VALIDITY OF COMMON STOCK Latham & Watkins LLP will pass on the validity of the common stock offered by this registration statement.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware provides that a corporation has the power to indemnify a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation and certain other persons serving at the request of the corporation in related capacities against amounts paid and expenses incurred in connection with an action or proceeding to which he is or is threatened to be made a party by reason of such position, if such person shall have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, in any criminal proceeding, if such person had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful; provided that, in the case of actions brought by or in the right of the corporation, no indemnification shall be made with respect to any matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the adjudicating court determines that such indemnification is proper under the circumstances. Article VI of the registrants by-laws provides that a director or officer of the registrant (a) shall be indemnified by the registrant against all expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any litigation or other legal proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the registrant) brought against him by virtue of his position as a director or officer of the registrant if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful and (b) shall be indemnified by the registrant against expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of any action or suit by or in the right of the registrant by virtue of his position as a director or officer of the registrant if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant, except that no indemnification shall be made with respect to any such matter as to which such director or officer shall have been adjudged to be liable to the registrant, unless and only to the extent that a court determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that a director or officer has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the registrant upon receipt of an undertaking by the director or officer to repay such amount if the registrant ultimately determines that he is not entitled to indemnification. Indemnification shall be made by the registrant upon a determination that the applicable standard of conduct required for indemnification has been met and that indemnification of a director or officer is proper. Such determination shall be made (a) by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, or (b) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (c) by the stockholders of the registrant. II-1 Table of Contents Article VI of the registrants by-laws further provides that the indemnification provided therein is not exclusive, and provides that to the extent the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended or supplemented, Article V shall be amended automatically and construed so as to permit indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted by such law. Section 102(b)(7) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware provides, generally, that the certificate of incorporation may contain a provision providing, and Article EIGHTH of the registrants certificate of incorporation provides, that no director of the registrant shall be personally liable to the registrant or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, provided, that a director shall remain liable (i) for any breach of such directors duty of loyalty to the registrant or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or (iv) for any transaction from which such director derived an improper personal benefit. The registrant has a directors and officers liability insurance policy covering certain liabilities that may be incurred by its directors and officers. Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On April 4, 2012, the registrant issued and sold to the selling stockholder identified in the prospectus that is part of this registration statement $25 million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes and warrants to purchase up to 3,094,060 shares of the registrants common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000,000. The issuance and sale of the senior convertible notes and the warrants was exempt from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The registrant did not engage in any general solicitation or advertising with regard to the issuance and sale of the senior convertible notes and the warrants and did not offer securities to the public in connection with the issuance and sale. The registrant did not employ any underwriters in connection with the issuance and sale of the senior convertible notes or the warrants. The senior convertible notes and the warrants have the terms described in the registrants Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 4, 2012. Item 16. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules (a) Exhibits The exhibits to this registration statement are listed in the exhibit index, which appears elsewhere herein and is incorporated herein by reference. (b) Financial Statement Schedules Schedules have been omitted because the information to be set forth therein is not applicable or is shown in the consolidated financial statements or notes incorporated by reference from the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2011 and Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 13, 2012. Item 17. Undertakings The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed II-2 Table of Contents that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement. (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement. (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness; provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. (5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the provisions described in Item 14, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
