Forward-looking statements include statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenue or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs and other information that is not historical information. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, could, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, intend, potential, continue, seek or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology or by discussions of strategy. All forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our examination of historical operating trends, are based upon our current expectations and various assumptions. We believe there is a reasonable basis for our expectations and beliefs, but they are inherently uncertain. We may not realize our expectations and our beliefs may not prove correct. Actual results could differ materially from those described or implied by such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in this prospectus, under the heading Risk Factors and include, among others: 6  significant competition in our industry;  unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of our products on the Internet;  the incurrence of material product liability and product recall costs;  costs of compliance and our failure to comply with government regulations;  our failure to keep pace with the demands of our customers for new products;  the lack of long-term experience with human consumption of some of our products with innovative ingredients. We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our investors. However, there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control and that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the U.S. and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after we distribute this prospectus, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise. Consequently, forward-looking statements should be regarded solely as our current plans, estimates and beliefs. Potential investors should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Before investing in our common stock, investors should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, customer relationships and value of our proprietary products. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Risk Factors An investment in these securities involves an exceptionally high degree of risk and is extremely speculative in nature. Following are what we believe are all the material risks involved if you decide to purchase shares in this offering . The risks described below are the ones we believe are most important for you to consider. These risks are not the only ones that we face. If events anticipated by any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results or financial condition could suffer and the price of our common stock could decline. Risks Relating To Our Business IF WE LOSE OR ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN KEY PERSONNEL, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key personnel. We do not have an employment agreement with our executive officer, and we cannot guarantee that any such person will remain affiliated with us. If any of our key personnel were to cease their affiliation with us, our operating results could suffer. Further, we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers. If we lose or are unable to obtain the services of key personnel, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Risks Related To This Offering NO MARKET CURRENTLY EXISTS FOR OUR SECURITIES AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT SUCH A MARKET WILL EVER DEVELOP, OR IF DEVELOPED, WILL BE SUSTAINED. Our common stock is not currently eligible for trading on any stock exchange and there can be no assurance that our common stock will be listed on any stock exchange in the future. We intend to apply for listing on the NASD OTC Bulletin Board trading system pursuant to Rule 15c2-11 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, but there can be no assurance we will obtain such a listing. The bulletin board tends to be highly illiquid, in part because there is no national quotation system by which potential investors can track the market price of shares except through information received or generated by a limited number of broker-dealers that make a market in particular stocks. There is a greater chance of market volatility for securities that trade on the bulletin board as opposed to a national exchange or quotation system. This volatility may be caused by a variety of factors, including: the lack of readily available price quotations; the absence of consistent administrative supervision of "bid" and "ask" quotations; lower trading volume; and general market conditions. If no market for our shares materializes, you may not be able to sell your shares or may have to sell your shares at a significantly lower price. 7 IF OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE ACTIVELY TRADED ON A PUBLIC MARKET, THEY WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BE PENNY STOCKS. Broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks are regulated by certain penny stock rules adopted by the SEC. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price per share of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock the broker-dealer make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. WE WILL INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. ITEM 4. USE OF PROCEEDS We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the sale of this offering of approximately $25,000,000 million, based on an assumed initial public offering price of $0.50 per share The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to create a public market for our common stock, to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets and to increase our visibility in our markets. We expect to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets that complement our business. Proceeds will be used to finance the Company's ongoing start-up expenses, all costs associated with on and off site construction and infrastructure, and the cash shortfall until cash flow break even is achieved. Additionally, funds advanced will help to expedite the projected timeline which will, consequently, minimize the overall costs associated with the initial start-up, intended growth, and general operation. The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these net proceeds. The goal with respect to the investment of these net proceeds will be capital preservation and liquidity so that these funds are readily available to fund our operations. ITEM 5. DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE Since our common stock is not listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system, the offering price of the shares of common stock was determined by the Companys Board of Directors. 8 The offering price of the shares of our common stock does not necessarily bear any relationship to our book value, assets, past operating results, financial condition or any other established criteria of value. The facts considered in determining the offering price were our financial condition and prospects, our limited operating history and the general condition of the securities market. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange, we will be filing to obtain a listing on the OTCBB concurrently with the filing of this prospectus. In order to be quoted on the OTCBB, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, which operates the OTC Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. ITEM 6. DILUTION There are currently 30,000 shares of common stock outstanding. ITEM 7. SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS None. ITEM 8. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION Following this registration statement becoming effective, the selling stockholders may from time to time, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any or all of their shares of common stock or interests in shares of common stock on any stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions. These dispositions may be at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, at prices related to the prevailing market price, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. Our shares of common stock offered hereby by the selling stockholders may be sold from time to time by such stockholders, or by pledges, donees, transferees and other successors in interest thereto. These pledgees, donees, transferees and other successors in interest will be deemed selling stockholders for the purposes of this prospectus. Our shares of common stock may be sold: · on one or more exchanges or in the over-the-counter market (including the OTC Bulletin Board); or · in privately negotiated transactions. The shares may also be sold in compliance with Rule 144 of the Securities Act, after the end of the applicable holding periods, as then in effect. Any broker or dealer participating in such transactions as agent may receive a commission from the selling stockholders, or if they act as agent for the purchaser of such common stock, from such purchaser. The selling stockholders will likely pay the usual and customary brokerage fees for such services. Brokers or dealers may agree with the selling stockholders to sell a specified number of shares at a stipulated price per share and, to the extent such broker or dealer is unable to do so acting as agent for the selling stockholders, to purchase, as principal, any unsold shares at the price required to fulfill the respective brokers or dealers commitment to the selling stockholders. Brokers or dealers who acquire shares as principals may thereafter resell such shares from time to time in transactions in a market or on an exchange, in negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices, and in connection with such re-sales may pay or receive commissions to or from the purchasers of such shares. These transactions may involve cross and block transactions that may involve sales to and through other brokers or dealers. If applicable, the selling stockholders may distribute shares to one or more of their partners who are unaffiliated with us. Such partners may, in turn, distribute such shares as described above. We can provide no assurance that all or any of the common stock offered will be sold by the selling stockholders. We are bearing all costs relating to the registration of the common stock. The selling stockholders must comply with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in the offer and sale of the common stock. In particular, during such times as the selling stockholders may be deemed to be engaged in a distribution of the common stock, and therefore be considered to be an underwriter, they must comply with applicable law and we have informed them that they may not, among other things: 9 1. engage in any stabilization activities in connection with the shares; 2. effect any sale or distribution of the shares until after the prospectus shall have been appropriately amended or supplemented, if required, to describe the terms of the sale or distribution; and 3. bid for or purchase any of the shares or rights to acquire the shares or attempt to induce any person to purchase any of the shares or rights to acquire the shares, other than as permitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ITEM 9. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES Common Stock We are authorized by our Articles of Incorporation to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock, no par value.

Preferred Stock There are no preferred shares authorized to be issued. Dividends We have not paid any cash dividends to our shareholders. The declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial position, our general economic conditions, and other pertinent conditions. It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in our business operations.

Description of Business CK Vineyards, Inc. is the accumulation of years of planning and development of a 20 acre vineyard site in Temecula California. The business will be sales driven with a competitive advantage in production, operations and marketing. Temecula is well known for this Southern California vineyard region. The purpose of the Business Plan is to communicate and asses the opportunity of building a tasting room, barrel facility, and operating a profitable business enterprise. Consideration has been given to the following factors: · Location · Complementary business climate · Mature and emerging market · Expertise of management · Competitive advantage · Brand recognition · Availability of 3 rd party contact services · Site features and benefits · Identify and articulate the business opportunity · Assessment of risk and mitigation History The property was selected from several sites available in the market in 2005-2006. In June, 2006 a small group of investors pur­chased the site with cash and debt for $1,585,000. Due to the expertise of Jim Quirk in both entitlement and winery construction, he began the process to split the 20 acre agricultural property into two 10 acre commercial sites with the intent to either develop or sell one of the 10 acre sites for profit and capital return. During the entitlement and lot split process, ownership has decided to submit plans for approval to build a winery and tasting room as a build to suit or owner operator business opportunity. The property is expected to have an ap­praised value of $1,300,000 with the additional $400,000 of entitlement and plans ap­proved for permits. Management believes this approval minimizes the risk and adds substantial value to the property, collateral, and success of the business plan. We acquired this specific 20+ acre site because:  CV (Citrus Vineyard) zoning allows one (1) winery - Tasting & Production fa­cilities and B & B, for each 10+ acre site.  The soil is perfect for growing grapes.  The property has been dividing into two (2) 10 acre sites for value-added similar to a residential sub-division with our entitlement on June 10, 2008.  The site is in Winery Row, approximately 250 yards north of Rancho Califor­nia, the main road for winery tours.  Calle Contento Road is one of the first cross streets on the tour and already has several vineyards and wineries in production.  The topology for grape growing is gentle slope, facing west/southwest for in­credible sunset views and cool evening breezes.  Adjacent to existing Alexs Red Barn Winery, Long Shadow Winery and Falk­ner Winery makes this site on the path of tours.  CV zoning on 10 acres provides for 20 room B & B and special events (weddings, restaurant, tasting, music events, etc.) and adds a complement to CK Vineyards.  Additionally the added 10 acre site can have commercial, production, and a wine label for private stock branding.  The street has already been widened, newly paved, and underground utilities up-to-date keeping the assessment low.  CV zoning has a lower tax base if 75% of the acreage is held in vineyards. Due to the limitations of 10+ acre parcels there will be fewer wineries in the area in the future. Sales deposits are expected to be $352k and $1.38M for years one and two respectively. Cash flow is expected to be consistently positive after month 14. 11 Lastly, it is important to point out that there is some seasonality to the business in that club sales occur 4-5 times a year. Since management has identified these cycles, a strategic plan for production and distribution is incorporated into this plan. Additionally, there are sales spikes (and subsequent increase in cash flow) with harvest, special events, holiday weekends, and cycles of the region. Southern California wineries experience a near 10 month season to help level sales and expense cycles. Management expects to operate accordingly with prudent cash management and building of reserves. Sales Strategy CK Vineyards, Inc. plans to market its wines as a taste of Southern California and, even more specifically, of the Temecula Valley. The Temecula Valley needs a wine that stands out from the herd. We intend to make this very product with a wine that re presents a smooth blend of the Southern California sun, fine fruit from its fields, and the rich Temecula Valley wine making history. With our collective background in the wine business, we believe that our winery will prove to be of the finest quality and best value in the valley. The CK Vineyards, Inc.s management team will use a variety of marketing approaches including local periodicals, the Barrel Tasting Festival, the Temecula Valley Balloon & Wine Festival, and various other opportunities provided by our membership in t he Temecula Valley Wine growers Association and the Chamber of Commerce. We have additional plans for a Rewards Card rebate program for our regular patrons. Sale of the companys Wines will be handled by internal and external sales forces as well as independent agents and representatives for individualized sales. Bankruptcy or Similar Proceedings There has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding pertaining to the Company. Reorganizations, Purchase or Sale of Assets There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not done in the ordinary course of business pertaining to the Company. Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements, or Labor Contracts We have no current plans for any registrations such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts. We will assess the need for any copyright, trademark or patent applications on an ongoing basis. Employees We currently have zero employees. We do use Robert Kipper, the Chief Executive Officer, Dennis Cullen, the President and Jim Quick the Secretary of the Company, to provide management services to us. There are no formal employment agreements between the Company and our current executive officers. Description of Property The Company does not have any property interest and is not tantamount to property ownership. The Company does not have any plants or other property. The Company's principal operations are located in Temecula California. It is not anticipated that expanded facilities will be in the near future. Legal Proceedings There are no current, past, pending or threatened legal proceedings or administrative actions either by or against the issuer that could have a material effect on the issuers business, financial condition, or operations. 12 Going Concern Our independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph to their audit opinion issued in connection with our financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2010 with respect to their doubt about our ability to continue. The Company has incurred operating losses since its inception in 2009, and has an accumulated deficit of $10,289 at December 31, 2010 which together raises doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern will be determined by our ability to sustain a successful level of operations and to continue to raise capital from debt, equity and other sources. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash balance is $3,366 as of December 31, 2010. We generated no in revenues during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. We expect that we have adequate funds available to pay for our minimum level of operations. Our auditor has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we begin selling supplements. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage. Forward Looking Statements Except for historical information, the following Plan of Operation contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve certain risks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements include statements regarding, among other things, (a) our projected sales and profitability, (b) our growth strategies, (c) anticipated trends in our industry, (d) our future financing plans, (e) our anticipated needs for working capital, (f) our lack of operational experience and (g) the benefits related to ownership of our common stock. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies, and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend, or project or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from the future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. These statements may be found under Managements Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operations and Description of Business, as well as in this Prospectus generally. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, the risks outlined under Risk Factors and matters described in this Prospectus generally. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this Prospectus will in fact occur as projected. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital There is minimal historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are a developmental stage company and have generated minimal revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in the exploration of our property, and possible cost overruns due to increases in the cost of services. To become profitable and competitive, we must constantly maintain the proper amount of inventory, pricing, market share and keep overhead to a minimum. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available we may be unable to continue operations. 13 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make a wide variety of estimates and assumptions that affect: (1) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and (2) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods covered by the financial statements. Our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the future resolution of the uncertainties increases, these judgments become even more subjective and complex. We have identified certain accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and several of those critical accounting policies are as follows: Revenue Recognition . The company has had no revenues to date. It is the Companys policy that revenues will be recognized in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, "Revenue Recognition." Under SAB 104, product revenues (or service revenues) are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred (or service has been performed), the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-09, Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements (ASU 2010-09), which is included in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the ASC) Topic 855 (Subsequent Events). ASU 2010-09 clarifies that an SEC filer is required to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU 2010-09 is effective upon the issuance of the final update and did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as ASC 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, aside from those issued by the SEC. ASC 105 does not change current U.S. GAAP, but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative U.S. GAAP by providing all authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place. The adoption of ASC 105 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements, but did eliminate all references to pre-codification standards. The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. Results of Operations Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. The Company generated no revenues during the 12 months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. . Operating Costs and Expenses General and administrative expenses during the 12 months ended December 31, 2010 were $9,589 compared to $700 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2009.

(A Development Stage Company) We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of CK Vineyards, Inc. (the Development Stage Company) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related statement of operation, changes in shareholders equity and cash flow for the years then ended and the period from January 16, 2009 (inception) through December 31, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CK Vineyards , Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the result of its operation and its cash flow for the years then ended and the period from January 16, 2009 (inception) to December 31, 2010 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, the Companys losses from operations and no operation raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ Chang Park CHANG G.

F-6 CK VINEYARDS, INC. (A DVELOPMENT STATAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2010 and 2009 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS CK Vineyards, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the state of California on January 16, 2009. The Company is in the development stage as defined under Statement on Financial Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Codification FASB ASC 915-205 "Development-Stage Entities". Its activities to date have been limited to capital formation, organization, and development of its business plan and a target customer market. The Company, will be known as Wheeler Ridge Winery and Vineyards, after developing a 20 acre site in Temecula, CA for cultivation and production of a full service vineyard and winery. NOTE 2 - PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company's system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods being presented NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A. Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of deposit and other highly- liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents.

(A DVELOPMENT STATAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2010 and 2009 NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES-continued E. Stock-based compensation We follow ASC 718-10, "Stock Compensation", which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. F. Income Taxes Income taxes are provided in accordance with Codifications topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach for the financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Current income tax expense (benefit) is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable (receivable) for the current year. A deferred tax asset and/or liability is computed for both the expected future impact of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred income tax expense is generally the net change during the year in the deferred income tax asset and liability. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be more likely than not realized in future tax returns. Tax rate changes and changes in tax law are reflected in income in the period such changes are enacted. H. Earnings (loss) per share Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents (primarily outstanding options and warrants). Common stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of the outstanding stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method. The calculation of fully diluted earnings (loss) per share assumes the dilutive effect of the exercise of outstanding options and warrants at either the beginning of the respective period presented or the date of issuance, whichever is later. As of the balance sheet dates the Company had no outstanding warrants. I. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and (iii) the reported amount of net sales and expenses recognized during the periods presented. Adjustments made with respect to the use of estimates often relate to improved information not previously available. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements; accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates. F-8 CK VINEYARDS, INC. (A DVELOPMENT STATAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2010 and 2009 These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues, costs and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates. NOTE 4 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-09, Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements (ASU 2010-09), which is included in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the ASC) Topic 855 (Subsequent Events). ASU 2010-09 clarifies that an SEC filer is required to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU 2010-09 is effective upon the issuance of the final update and did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as ASC 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, aside from those issued by the SEC. ASC 105 does not change current U.S. GAAP, but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative U.S. GAAP by providing all authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place. The adoption of ASC 105 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements, but did eliminate all references to pre-codification standards. The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. NOTE 5 - GOING CONCERN The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $10,298 as of December 31, 2010 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from director and/or private placement of common stock. NOTE 6 - COMMON STOCK The Company issued 30,000 shares of its common stock, to its three owners for cash of $1,055 on February 15, 2009. The Company has 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock authorized without par value. F-9 CK VINEYARDS, INC.

NOTE 8 - RELATED PARTY PAYABLE At December 31, 2010 the company was advance funds by its founders for operations. Terms are without interest payable on demand. F-10
