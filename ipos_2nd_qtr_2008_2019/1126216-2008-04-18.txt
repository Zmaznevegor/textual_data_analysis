(“Robomatix”) which Tiv Taam currently owns. Robomatix owns approximately 90% of the issued share capital of Tadiran Telecom-Communication Services In Israel Ltd. (“Tadiran Telecom”), which is the general partner of Tadiran Telecom-Communication Services In Israel – Limited Partnership (“Tadiran Telecom LP”), an Israeli entity dealing with the distribution, maintenance, assistance services and sale of switchboards for the business community in Israel. Accordingly, upon consummation of the acquisition, Xfone 018 will also acquire control over Tadiran Telecom and Tadiron Telecom LP. The purchase price for the acquisition is NIS 44,000,000 (approximately $12,611,063), subject to adjustment as set forth in the agreement, payable in three installments. Additional information with respect to this acquisition may be found under “Business” below. On March 25, 2008, we purchased from Nir Davison and Trecastle Holdings Limited the shares of common stock of Story Telecom, Inc. that each party owned, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of £270,000 ($531,209), pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement entered into between the parties on that date. Upon acquisition of the shares of common stock of Story Telecom, Inc. from Mr. Davison and Trecastle Holdings, Story Telecom, Inc. became our wholly owned subsidiary.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may impair our business operations. If any of the adverse events described in this risk factors section actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. We have had operating losses from time to time and cannot assure that we will be profitable in the foreseeable future. We make various statements in this section which constitute “forward-looking” statements under Section 27A of the Securities Act. An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. We cannot assure prospective investors that we will continue operations or make a profit in the future. No purchase of Common Stock should be made by any person who cannot afford a total loss of his or her investment. In addition to the other information provided in this Prospectus, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business before purchasing any Common Stock. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS WHILE WE ACT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENERAL CONDITIONS OF ENTITLEMENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND ACCORDING TO OUR LICENSES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL, IF WE DO NOT COMPLY WITH AND CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE TERMS OF SUCH REGIMES AND/OR LICENSES AND THE RELEVANT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD LOSE OUR ENTITLEMENT AND/OR LICENSES TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES IN THESE JURISDICTIONS. Not complying with, or indeed violating the conditions of our licenses and the related laws and regulations could lead to the loss of, material changes to, or freezing of our entitlement and/or licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Without such authorization or licenses we would not be able to provide any approved and/or licensed services, resulting in a loss of revenues. Such violations of our licenses in the U.S. or Israel could lead to monetary penalties. WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM, ISRAEL AND OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHICH MAY LEAD US TO INCUR INCREASED BUSINESS COSTS AND HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS UPON OUR BUSINESS INCLUDING REVENUES AND POTENTIAL PROFITABILITY. We serve customers in many countries, all of which have different regulations, jurisdictions, and standards and controls related to licensing, telecommunications, import/export, currency and trade. Regulatory changes pertaining to future regulatory classification of Internet related telephone services, otherwise known as VOIP telephony, may lead to burdensome regulatory requirements and fees, as well as additional interconnection fees to carriers and changes in access charges, universal service, and regulatory fee payments, which would affect our international and long distance services related costs and may have a material impact upon our ability to conduct business, as well as our revenues. Our compliance with foreign rules and regulations may lead to increased costs of doing business or reduced revenues from having to decrease or eliminate our business in certain foreign countries, all of which may negatively affect our potential profitability. For more detailed information regarding our foreign business, please see the “Business” section. IF OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE OR EQUIPMENT IS DAMAGED OR INOPERATIVE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. We rely on our telecommunications equipment, including, but not limited to our switchboard and switches, to provide services to our customers. In the event that such equipment is not able to provide the services for which it is then used, we may not be able to provide services to our customers. While we have back-up for much of this equipment, if any portion of the equipment is unavailable for any extended period of time, it will be difficult to provide service to our customers, might give rise to the ability of our customers to terminate agreements with us, and would generally have a detrimental effect on retaining our customers. -8- IF OUR SUPPLIERS' TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS DAMAGED, IT COULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. We rely on certain suppliers' telecommunications infrastructure in order to provide services to our customers. If their ability to supply such services to us is damaged in any way, we may be required to incur additional costs to replace such services and we may not be able to provide service to our customers. IF OUR INFORMATION AND BILLINGS SYSTEMS ARE UNABLE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY AS OUR OPERATIONS GROW, WE MAY EXPERIENCE SYSTEM DISRUPTIONS, REDUCED LEVELS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND A DECLINING CUSTOMER BASE AND REVENUES. Over the past two years, our business revenues and operations have increased significantly. We now handle millions of transactions on a daily basis with hundreds of thousands of customers and users located in many countries. Accordingly, our information and billing systems are under increasing stress. We use internally developed and acquired systems to operate our services and for transaction processing, including billing and collections processing. We must continually improve these systems in order to meet the level of use. Furthermore, in the future, we may add features and functionality to our products and services using internally developed or third party licensed technologies. Our inability to add software and hardware or develop and upgrade existing technology, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure to meet increased volume through our processing systems or provide new features or functionality, may cause system disruptions, slower response times, reductions in levels of customer service, decreased quality of the user's experience, collection difficulties, and delays in reporting accurate financial information. Any such failure could cause system disruptions, reduced levels of customer service, and a declining customer base and revenues. WE SERVE AN EXTREMELY LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS / USERS AND ARE THUS AT RISK FOR CLASS ACTION LAW SUITS. Because we provide services to so many customers / users, it is possible that such customers / users may join together in a large or expensive class action to initiate an action. There is currently no class action lawsuit threatened or filed against us, however, class action lawsuits have become much more popular in both the United States and Israel where we have much of our operations. TERRORIST ATTACKS, WAR, OR ARMED CONFLICT OR POLITICAL / ECONOMIC EVENTS OR UPHEAVALS MAY LEAD TO A DISRUPTION IN OUR SERVICES AS WELL AS DECREASED DEMAND. Terrorist attacks in the United States, the United Kingdom, or Israel, as well as the United States and the United Kingdom's involvement in Iraq or in armed conflict or political / economic events in countries where we conduct business, may negatively impact consumers' confidence in relying on alternative communication lines and spending in the countries where we conduct our business. Certain of our key employees, officers and directors are residents of Israel. Accordingly, armed conflicts between Israel and its neighbors, terrorism, political and economic conditions in Israel directly affect the Company's business. Any such occurrences could lead to an interruption in our services and could negatively affect our revenues and results of operations. Moreover, the governments in those countries might take extreme measures that could prohibit access to alternative communication lines. NATURAL DISASTERS AND ACTS OF G.OD MAY RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS. Our wholly owned subsidiary Xfone USA, Inc. is positioned in an environment which has a higher than average propensity to experience hurricanes. In 2005, we suffered adverse affects to our business from Hurricane Katrina. Additionally, the headquarters of our wholly owned subsidiaries NTS Communications, Inc. and Xfone USA, Inc. are located in Lubbock, Texas, which is a location where tornadoes are most frequent. In the event of another hurricane, or tornadoes, the cost of restructuring our facilities, as well as the time spent in rebuilding and organizing our infrastructure might be long and costly. There is no guarantee that we will not be negatively affected in the future by other natural disasters, hurricanes, tornadoes or acts of G.od. -9- IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN FINANCING AS WE GROW OUR BUSINESS, WE MAY HAVE TO CURTAIL OUR PLANS AND THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. Our future business will involve substantial costs, primarily those costs associated with marketing, business development, and possible mergers and acquisitions. If our revenues are insufficient to fund our operations as we grow our business, we may need traditional bank financing or financing from debt or equity offerings. However, if we are unable to obtain financing when needed, we may be forced to curtail our operations, which could negatively affect our revenues and potential profitability and the value of your investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing when needed or if available that it will be on commercially reasonable terms. THE COMPANY MIGHT BE REGARDED AS A LOCAL TAX RESIDENT IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. The Company was incorporated in Nevada, U.S.A, and accordingly is a US tax resident and is taxed in the US. To the best knowledge of the Company, and based on consultancy provided by its accountants, the Company is not a tax resident in any other country in which it conducts business (directly or indirectly through local subsidiaries). However, there is no assurance that none of the local tax authorities in these countries will determine that the Company is a local tax resident, and thus we recommend that the investors examine the tax implication of such potential classification. Any determination by such local tax authorities could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or the consequences of your investment in our securities. SHOULD OUR AGREEMENTS WITH OUR PRINCIPAL SUPPLIERS, AT&T INC., BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS OR BEZEQ THE ISRAEL TELECOMMUNICATION CORP. LIMITED BE CANCELLED, OUR OPERATIONS WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. We are dependent on several of our principal suppliers. However, these suppliers are required to provide us with services according to the relevant regulations and their licenses to operate as a telecommunications provider in the relevant jurisdictions. Should our agreements involving our principal suppliers, AT&T, Inc., British Telecommunications or Bezeq The Israel Telecommunication Corp. Limited be cancelled, our operations may be negatively affected. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY COMPETE WITH OUR COMPETITORS. The telecommunications business is a very competitive one with constantly shrinking margins. Our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in customer needs or to devote greater resources than we can to developing and expanding our services. Such competitors could also attempt to increase their presence in our markets by forming strategic alliances with other competitors, by offering new or improved products or services or by increasing their efforts to gain and retain market share through competitive pricing. Companies which currently view our services as complementary to their own (such as mobile network operators) may decide, where the regulatory regime permits, to change this policy and bar their customers from accessing our services or charge their customers a premium to access our services. As the market for our services matures, price competition and penetration into the market will intensify. Such competition may adversely affect our gross profits, margins and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with existing or new competitors. OUR MANAGEMENT DECISIONS ARE MADE BY OUR FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, ABRAHAM KEINAN, AND OUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, GUY NISSENSON, AND OUR TREASURER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING OFFICER, NIV KRIKOV; IF WE LOSE THEIR SERVICES, OUR OPERATIONS WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. The success of our business is largely dependent upon the expertise of our Chairman of the Board, Abraham Keinan, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Guy Nissenson, and our Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, Niv Krikov. Because Messrs Keinan, Nissenson and Krikov are essential to our operations, you must rely on their management decisions. We have not obtained any “key man” life insurance relating to Messrs Keinan, Nissenson or Krikov. There is no assurance that we would be able to hire and retain another Chairman of the Board, President/Chief Executive Officer, or Treasurer/Chief Financial Officer/ Principal Accounting Officer with comparable expertise. As a result, the loss of either Mr. Keinan's, Mr. Nissenson's or Mr. Krikov’s services could have a materially adverse affect upon our business, financial condition, and results of operation. -10- OUR MANAGEMENT HAS SIGNIFICANT CONTROL OVER STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ELECT OUR DIRECTORS AND ACCORDINGLY CONTROL OUR OPERATIONS. As of the date of this Prospectus, our Chairman of the Board, Abraham Keinan, beneficially owns 18.32% of our Common Stock. Our President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Guy Nissenson has significant influence over an additional 6.53% of our Common Stock, which is owned by Campbeltown Business Ltd., an entity owned and controlled by Mr. Nissenson and his family. In addition, certain stockholders provided Mr. Nissenson and Mr. Keinan with irrevocable proxies representing a total of 6.00% of our Common Stock. Eyal Harish, a director, beneficially owns 0.08% of our Common Stock. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Swiftnet Limited, beneficially owns 0.71% of our Common Stock. Therefore, our management potentially may vote 31.64% of our Common Stock, without giving effect to the issuance of any shares upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options. As such, our management may have control over the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our Common Stock, including the election of our directors (who serve on a classified Board of Directors, with staggered terms of office), amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws and approval of significant corporate transactions. Additionally, our management may be able to delay, deter or prevent a change in our control that might be beneficial to our other stockholders. We need to emphasize the fact that management could make substantial decisions that could be protected under the business judgment rule, and not necessarily satisfy minority shareholders (for example, expanding the territory of operation at heavy costs, or by limiting the territory of our operations in order to save capital). In addition to the foregoing, our Chairman of the Board, Abraham Keinan, and our President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Guy Nissenson, exercise significant control over stockholder matters through a September 28, 2004 Voting Agreement between Mr. Keinan, Mr. Nissenson and Campbeltown Business, Ltd., an entity owned and controlled by Mr. Nissenson and his family. This agreement, which is for a term of 10 years, provides that: (a) Messrs. Keinan and Nissenson and Campbeltown Business, Ltd. agree to vote any shares of our Common Stock controlled by them only in such manner as previously agreed by all these parties; and (b) in the event of any disagreement regarding the manner of voting, a party to the agreement will not vote any shares, unless all the parties have settled the disagreement. CERTAIN OF OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAIN A NUMBER OF RESTRICTIONS AND OBLIGATIONS THAT MAY LIMIT OUR FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. Our credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that limit our financial flexibility. These covenants, among other things, restrict our right to pledge our assets, make loans or give guarantees, and engage in mergers or consolidations. Our ability to continue to comply with these and other obligations depends in part on the future performance of our business. There can be no assurance that such obligations will not have a materially adverse affect on our ability to finance our future operations. RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK THERE IS A LIMITED MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK, AND AN ACTIVE TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK MAY NEVER DEVELOP, WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO RESELL YOUR SHARES. Trading in our stock has been limited and has been characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. Therefore, shareholders should be aware that the lack of exposure to our stock in the investment community could consequently be reflected by a lack of market trading upon the issuance of material information that could be perceived as disappointing or very encouraging from a market point of view. This could result in an inability for shareholders to be able to dispose of their shares. THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE VOLATILE AND YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESELL YOUR SHARES AT OR ABOVE THE PRICE YOU PAID FOR THEM, OR AT ALL. The stock markets in general have experienced during the past few years extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices of securities of technology companies have been extremely volatile, and have experienced fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. For example, during 2003, the market price of our Common Stock fluctuated between $0.35 and $6.00; during 2004, the market price of our Common Stock fluctuated between $1.95 and $5.75; during 2005, the market price fluctuated between $2.30 and $4.29; during 2006, the market price fluctuated between $2.18 and $3.84; and during 2007, the market price fluctuated between $2.34 and $3.88. The market price of our Common Stock traded on the AMEX fluctuated between $2.82 and $3.60 during the first quarter of 2008. -11- The market price of our Common Stock may continue to fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including: · any actual or anticipated fluctuations in our or our competitors' revenues and operating results; · shortfalls in our operating results from levels forecast by us or by securities analysts; · public announcements concerning us or our competitors; · the introduction or market acceptance of new products or service offerings by us or by our competitors; · changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors; · changes in security analysts' financial estimates; · changes in accounting principles; · sales of our shares by existing shareholders; and · the loss of any of our key personnel. In addition, economic, political, and market conditions and military conflicts and, in particular, those specifically related to Israel, may affect the market price of our shares. OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE TRADED ON MORE THAN ONE MARKET AND THIS MAY RESULT IN PRICE VARIATIONS. Our shares of Common Stock are trade on the American Stock Exchange and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Trading in our shares of Common Stock on these markets takes place in different currencies (dollars on the AMEX, and NIS on the TASE), and at different times (resulting from different time zones, different trading days and different public holidays in the United States and Israel). The trading prices of our Common Stock on these two markets may differ due to these and other factors. Any decrease in the trading price of our shares of Common Stock on one of these markets could cause a decrease in the trading price of our shares of Common Stock on the other market. FUTURE SALES OF OUR SHARES IN THE PUBLIC MARKET OR ISSUANCES OF ADDITIONAL SECURITIES COULD CAUSE THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO FALL. As of April 15, 2008, we had 18,438,925 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. In addition, we have reserved 5,489,595 shares of Common Stock for issuance under our 2004 Stock Option Plan, 8,000,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance under our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, 7,060,179 shares of Common Stock underlying warrants, and 123,929 shares of Common Stock underlying a certain Secured Convertible Term Note. If a large number of shares of our Common Stock is sold in a short period, the price of our Common Stock would likely decrease.

Sales under Rule 144 are also limited by manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us. Rule 144 also provides that a person who is not deemed to have been an affiliate of ours at any time during the three months preceding a sale, and who has for at least six months beneficially owned shares of our Common Stock that are restricted securities, will be entitled to freely sell such shares of our Common Stock subject only to the availability of current public information regarding us.

SELLING STOC KHOLDERS We are registering an aggregate of 5,906,020 shares of Common Stock for resale by the Selling Stockholders listed in the three tables below. All expenses incurred with respect to the registration of the Common Stock will be bared by us, but we will not be obligated to pay any underwriting fees, discounts, commissions or other expenses incurred by the Selling Stockholders in connection with the sale of such shares. The following tables set forth information with respect to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Selling Stockholders named below and as adjusted to give effect to the sale of the shares offered hereby. The shares beneficially owned have been determined in accordance with rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. The information in the table below is current as of the date of this Prospectus. All information contained in the table below is based upon information provided to us by the Selling Stockholders and we have not independently verified this information. The Selling Stockholders are not making any representation that any shares covered by this Prospectus will be offered for sale. The Selling Stockholders may from time to time offer and sell pursuant to this Prospectus any or all of the Common Stock being registered. Except as indicated below in the notes to the tables below, none of the Selling Stockholders held any position or office with us, nor are any of the Selling Stockholders associates or affiliates of any of our officers or directors.

Except as indicated below, no selling stockholder is a registered broker-dealer or an affiliate of a broker-dealer. For purposes of these tables, beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, and includes investment power with respect to shares and shares owned pursuant to warrants or options exercisable within 60 days. The number of shares presented as owned in the tables assumes that all warrants and options are fully exercised, and the "Number of Shares Beneficially Owned after the Offering” columns assume the sale of all shares offered. The percentages of shares beneficially owned are based on 18,438,925 shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding as of April 15, 2008, and is calculated by dividing the number of shares that person beneficially owns by the sum of (a) the total number of shares outstanding on April 15, 2008, plus (b) the number of shares such person has the right to aquire within 60 days of April 15, 2008.

Such sales may be at fixed prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to the market prices or at negotiated prices. The shares of Common Stock being offered for resale by this Prospectus may be sold by the selling security holders by one or more of the following methods: · block trades in which the broker or dealer so engaged will attempt to sell the shares of Common Stock as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; · purchases by broker or dealer as principal and resale by the broker or dealer for its account pursuant to this Prospectus; · an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange; · ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker solicits purchasers; · privately negotiated transactions; · market sales (both long and short to the extent permitted under the federal securities laws); · at the market to or through market makers or into an existing market for the shares; · through transactions in options, swaps or other derivatives (whether exchange listed or otherwise); and · a combination of any of the aforementioned methods of sale. In the event of the transfer by any of the Selling Stockholders of its warrants, options or shares of Common Stock to any pledgee, donee or other transferee, we will amend this Prospectus and the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus forms a part by the filing of a post-effective amendment in order to have the pledgee, donee or other transferee in place of the selling stockholder who has transferred his, her or its shares. In effecting sales, brokers and dealers engaged by the Selling Stockholders may arrange for other brokers or dealers to participate. Brokers or dealers may receive commissions or discounts from a selling stockholder or, if any of the broker-dealers act as an agent for the purchaser of such shares, from a purchaser in amounts to be negotiated which are not expected to exceed those customary in the types of transactions involved. Broker-dealers may agree with a selling stockholder to sell a specified number of the shares of Common Stock at a stipulated price per share. Such an agreement may also require the broker-dealer to purchase as principal any unsold shares of Common Stock at the price required to fulfill the broker-dealer commitment to the selling stockholder if such broker-dealer is unable to sell the shares on behalf of the selling stockholder. Broker-dealers who acquire shares of Common Stock as principal may thereafter resell the shares of Common Stock from time to time in transactions which may involve block transactions and sales to and through other broker-dealers, including transactions of the nature described above. Such sales by a broker-dealer could be at prices and on terms then prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to the then-current market price or in negotiated transactions. In connection with such resales, the broker-dealer may pay to or receive from the purchasers of the shares commissions as described above. The Selling Stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that participate with the Selling Stockholders in the sale of the shares of Common Stock may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with these sales. In that event, any commissions received by the broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares of Common Stock purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. From time to time, any of the Selling Stockholders may pledge shares of Common Stock pursuant to the margin provisions of customer agreements with brokers. Upon a default by a selling stockholder, their broker may offer and sell the pledged shares of Common Stock from time to time. Upon a sale of the shares of Common Stock, the Selling Stockholders intend to comply with the Prospectus delivery requirements under the Securities Act by delivering a Prospectus to each purchaser in the transaction. We intend to file any amendments or other necessary documents in compliance with the Securities Act which may be required in the event any of the Selling Stockholders defaults under any customer agreement with brokers. -24- To the extent required under the Securities Act, a post effective amendment to this Registration Statement will be filed disclosing the name of any broker-dealers, the number of shares of Common Stock involved, the price at which the Common Stock is to be sold, the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealers, where applicable, that such broker-dealers did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus and other facts material to the transaction. We and the Selling Stockholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under it, including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 and, insofar as a selling stockholder is a distribution participant and we, under certain circumstances, may be a distribution participant, under Regulation M. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the Common Stock. Any commissions, discounts or other fees payable to brokers or dealers in connection with any sale of the shares of Common Stock will be borne by the selling security holders, the purchasers participating in such transaction, or both. Any shares of Common Stock covered by this Prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as amended, may be sold under Rule 144 rather than pursuant to this Prospectus.

Swiftnet was incorporated in 1990 under the laws of the United Kingdom and is headquartered in London, England.

Utilizing automation and proprietary software packages, Swiftnet’s strategy is to grow without the need for heavy investments and with lower expenses for operations and registration of new customers. Xfone 018 Ltd. On April 15, 2004, we established an Israel based subsidiary, Xfone Communication Ltd. (which changed its name to Xfone 018 Ltd. in March 2005). On July 4, 2004, the Ministry of Communications of the State of Israel granted Xfone 018 a license to provide international telecom services in Israel. We started providing services in Israel through Xfone 018 as of mid-December 2004. Headquartered in Petach Tikva, Israel, Xfone 018 Ltd. is a telecommunications service provider that owns and operates its own facilities-based telecommunications switching system. Xfone 018 provides residential and business customers with high quality international carrier services. WS Telecom, Inc. On May 28, 2004, we entered into an agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire WS Telecom, Inc., a Mississippi corporation, and its two wholly owned subsidiaries, eXpeTel Communications, Inc. and Gulf Coast Utilities, Inc., through the merger of WS Telecom into our wholly owned U.S. subsidiary Xfone USA, Inc. On July 1, 2004, Xfone USA entered into a management agreement with WS Telecom which provided that Xfone USA provide management services to WS Telecom pending the consummation of the merger. The management agreement provided that all revenues generated from WS Telecom business operations would be assigned and transferred to Xfone USA. The term of the management agreement commenced on July 1, 2004, and continued until the consummation of the merger on March 10, 2005. Xfone USA, Inc. is an integrated telecommunications service provider that owns and operates its own facilities-based, telecommunications switching system and network. Xfone USA provides residential and business customers with high quality local, long distance and high-speed broadband Internet services, as well as cable television services in certain planned residential communities in Mississippi. Xfone USA is licensed to provide telecommunications services in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi. Xfone USA utilizes integrated multi-media offerings - combining digital voice, data and video services over broadband technologies to deliver services to customers throughout its service areas. I-55 Internet Services, Inc. On August 18, 2005, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire I-55 Internet Services, Inc., a Louisiana corporation (the “I-55 Internet Merger Agreement”). On September 13, 2005, we filed a Form 8-K discussing the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the transaction contemplated by the I-55 Internet Merger Agreement. On October 10, 2005, we entered into a First Amendment to the Merger Agreement, by and among I-55 Internet Services, Xfone, Inc, Xfone USA, Inc., our wholly-owned United States subsidiary and Hunter McAllister and Brian Acosta, key employees of I-55 Internet Services, in order to induce Xfone, Inc and Xfone USA not to terminate the I-55 Internet Merger Agreement due to the material adverse effect that Hurricane Katrina has had on the assets and business of I-55 Internet Services. As part of the amendment and since, at that time, the merger of I-55 Internet Services with and into Xfone USA had not been consummated yet, in the interim, the parties agreed and entered into on October 11, 2005 a Management Agreement (the “I-55 Internet Management Agreement”) that provided that I-55 Internet Services hired and appointed Xfone USA as manager to be responsible for the operation and management of all of I-55 Internet Services business operations, including among other things personnel, accounting, contracts, policies and budget. In consideration of the management services provided under the I-55 Internet Management Agreement, I-55 Internet Services assigned and transferred to Xfone USA all revenues generated and expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business during the term of the I-55 Internet Management Agreement. The term of the I-55 Internet Management Agreement commenced on October 11, 2005 and continued until the consummation of the merger on March 31, 2006. -31- In conjunction with the consummation of the merger and in exchange for all of the capital stock of I-55 Internet Services, we issued a total of 789,863 shares of our Common Stock valued at $2,380,178 and 603,939 warrants exercisable for a period of five years into shares of our Common Stock, with an exercise price of $3.31, valued based on the Black Scholes option-pricing model (the “Xfone Stock and Warrant Consideration”). A portion of the Xfone Stock and Warrant Consideration issued at closing was placed in an escrow account, to be held pending certain adjustments. The Company subsequently made the following two claims against such escrow account: Claim #1: The Company made a claim on March 27, 2007 to adjust the total consideration based upon the changes in customer billings as determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the First Amendment to the Merger Agreement (the “Customer Billing Adjustment Amount”), which the Company had determined was $247,965.57. Claim #2: The Company determined an undisclosed liability, in accordance with Article 6.03 of the I-55 Internet Services, Inc. Merger Agreement (as amended), in the amount of $147,550 and on November 28, 2006, sent a claim for this amount. The Shareholder Representatives of I-55 Internet Services disputed the amounts in both claims submitted and so the parties entered into negotiations on May 2, 2007, where they agreed to reduce the amount claimed in Claim #1 by $104,948.46, which represents adjustments made to the 90-Day column, Trade Accounts, and certain accounts that had previously been listed as having 90-Day balances but were subsequently confirmed as not having 90-Day balances, and by the final amount billed to EBI Comm, Inc. (“EBI”) in 2005 prior to the assets of EBI being purchased by Xfone USA, and agreed to reduce the original Loss amount claimed in Claim #2 by $6,800.00, representing additional services purchased with Zipa, Inc. under the direction of Xfone USA during the Management Agreement period from October 2005 through March 2006. Upon settlement of the claims, two Joint Deposition Notices for the escrow agent, Trustmark National Bank, were delivered to the Shareholder Representatives of I-55 Internet Services for execution, however, a Shareholder Representative refused to execute the notices pending approval of the claims by the shareholders of I-55 Internet Services. On June 7, 2007, the shareholders met and rejected the figure agreed upon with respect to Claim #1 and accepted the figure agreed upon with respect to Claim #2. There has been no further action taken by Xfone USA or us with respect to either of these claims. As a result of the rejection of the figure for Claim #1, the Company officially retracted the Joint Deposition of Escrow Claim, and consequently the original Pending Claim Notice dated March 27, 2007 in the amount of $247,965.57 is still claimed, and the revised Claim #2 in the amount of $140,750 is also claimed. Xfone USA’s new management, which was appointed following the Company’s acquisition of NTS, is reviewing this matter to determine how best to proceed in connection with the remaining pending claims against the escrow. In conjunction with that certain Letter Agreement dated October 10, 2005 with MCG Capital Corporation, a major creditor of I-55 Internet Services, and upon the consummation of the merger on March 31, 2006, we issued to MCG Capital 667,998 shares of our Common Stock, valued at fair value of $2,010,006, in return for retiring its loan with I-55 Internet Services. I-55 Internet Services provided Internet access and related services, such as installation of various networking equipment, website design, hosting and other Internet access installation services, throughout the Southeastern United States to individuals and businesses located predominantly in rural markets in Louisiana and Mississippi. As a result of the merger with and into Xfone USA, these services are now available in expanded markets throughout Louisiana and Mississippi. The Internet service offerings include dial-up, DSL, high speed dedicated Internet access, web services, email, the World Wide Web, Internet relay chat, file transfer protocol and Usenet news access to both residential and business customers. The I-55 Internet Services offerings provided various prices and packages that allowed I-55 Internet Services subscribers to customize their subscription with services that met customers’ particular requirements. Xfone USA now provides bundled services of voice and data (broadband Internet) to customers throughout its service areas. -32- On August 26, 2005, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire I-55 Telecommunications, LLC, a Louisiana corporation (the “I-55 Telecom Merger Agreement”). On September 13, 2005, we filed a Form 8-K discussing the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the transaction contemplated by the I-55 Telecom Merger Agreement. In order to demonstrate our intention to continue on with the transaction contemplated by the I-55 Telecom Merger Agreement, the parties entered into on October 12, 2005 a Management Agreement (the “I-55 Telecom Management Agreement”) that provided that I-55 Telecommunications hired and appointed Xfone USA as manager to be responsible for the operation and management of all of I-55 Telecommunications’ business operations. In consideration of the management services provided under the I-55 Telecom Management Agreement, I-55 Telecommunications assigned and transferred to Xfone USA all revenues generated and expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business during the term of the I-55 Telecom Management Agreement. The term of the I-55 Telecom Management Agreement commenced on October 12, 2005 and continued until the consummation of the merger on March 31, 2006. In conjunction with the consummation of the merger and in exchange for all of the capital stock of I-55 Telecommunications, LLC, we issued a total of 223,702 shares of our Common Stock valued at $671,687 and 79,029 warrants exercisable for a period of five years into shares of our Common Stock, with an exercise price of $3.38, valued based on the Black Scholes option-pricing model (the “Xfone Stock and Warrant Consideration”). A portion of the Xfone Stock and Warrant Consideration issued at closing was placed in an escrow account. The Company determined a breach of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement resulting from the failure of I-55 Telecommunications to disclose the liability due and payable to the Louisiana Universal Service Fund (“LA USF”) through the period of October 2005, at which time Xfone USA undertook the management role of I-55 Telecommunications. Pursuant to Section 1(g) of the Escrow Agreement dated as of March 31, 2006 by and among Xfone USA, the Escrow Agent, and the President and Sole Member of I-55 Telecommunications, and in accordance with Article 6.02 of the Merger Agreement, Xfone USA notified the other parties that it believed that it had suffered a Loss of $30,625.52, pursuant to the provisions of Article 6.02 of the Merger Agreement dated as of August 26, 2005. Having not received any response from the President and Sole Member of I-55 Telecommunications, nor from his counsel, on October 15, 2007, and after the allotted response time allowed, Xfone USA instructed the Escrow Agent (Trustmark National Bank) to deliver from the Escrow Fund of the President and Sole Member of I-55 Telecommunications, to the Company, 7,043 shares of Common Stock and 4,838 Xfone Stock Warrants. The 7,043 shares of Common Stock and 4,838 Xfone Stock Warrants were returned to the Company for cancellation on October 31, 2007. In conjunction with certain Agreements to Purchase Promissory Notes dated October 31, 2005 / February 3, 2006 with Randall Wade James Tricou; Rene Tricou - Tricou Construction; Rene Tricou - Bon Aire Estates; Rene Tricou - Bon Aire Utility; and Danny Acosta, creditors of I-55 Telecommunications (the “Creditors”), and upon the consummation of the merger on March 31, 2006, we issued to the Creditors an aggregate of 163,933 restricted shares of Common Stock and an aggregate of 81,968 warrants, exercisable at $3.38 per share, at a total value of $492,220, in return for retiring their individual loans with I-55 Telecommunications. I-55 Telecommunications provided voice, data and related services throughout Louisiana and Mississippi to both individuals and businesses. Prior to the merger with and into Xfone USA, I-55 Telecommunications was a licensed facility based CLEC operating in Louisiana and Mississippi with a next generation class 5 carrier-switching platform. I-55 Telecommunications provided a complete package of local and long distance services to residential and business customers across both states. As a result of the merger, Xfone USA has now expanded its On-Net (facilities) service area, through I-55 Telecommunications, into New Orleans, Louisiana and surrounding areas, including Hammond, Louisiana and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Xfone USA is expanding its sales offices to include New Orleans, in an effort to continue revenue growth and increase market share in the revitalized city, as well as into Biloxi, Mississippi, Hammond, Louisiana and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Regulations affecting the telecommunications industry began in March 2006; conversions of all circuits affected were completed in April 2006. The competition in secondary markets, such as Jackson, Mississippi, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Biloxi, Mississippi, as opposed to Tier 1 markets such as Atlanta, Georgia, is also rapidly declining due to the removal of UNE-P and the decline in the competitive local exchange providers that had been dependent on UNE-P as their only source for providing competitive local telephone services in those markets. This provides for a unique opportunity for Xfone USA to gain market share, by utilizing its existing network and to expand its facilities into these opportunity areas becoming a primary alternative to the monopoly Incumbent Local Exchange Company. -33- EBI Comm, Inc. On January 1, 2006, Xfone USA, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an Agreement with EBI Comm, Inc. (“EBI”), a privately held Internet Service Provider, to purchase the assets of EBI. EBI provided a full range of Internet access options for both commercial and residential customers in north Mississippi. Based in Columbus, Mississippi, EBI’s services included Dial-up, DSL, T1 Dedicated Access and Web Hosting. The customer base, numbering approximately 1,500 Internet users, is largely concentrated in the Golden Triangle area, which includes Columbus, West Point and Starkville, Mississippi. The acquisition was structured as an asset purchase, providing for Xfone USA to pay EBI total consideration equal to 50% of the monthly collected revenue from the customer base during the first 12 months, beginning January 2006. Acquired assets include the customer base and customer lists, trademarks and all related intellectual property, fixed assets and all account receivables. As a result of further negotiations between us and EBI, we have agreed to pay the total consideration of this acquisition in cash in the amount of $85,699 in monthly payments of $10,000 until paid in full, and we made the first of such payments on June 1, 2007 and final payment on January 25, 2008. The acquisition was not significant from an accounting perspective. Canufly.net, Inc. On January 10, 2006 (effective as of January 1, 2006), Xfone USA, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Canufly.net, Inc. (“Canufly.net”), an Internet Service Provider based in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and its principal shareholder, Mr. Michael Nassour. Canufly.net provided residential and business customers with high-speed Internet services and utilized the facilities-based network of Xfone USA, as an alternative to BellSouth, to provide Internet connectivity to its customers. Canufly.net also provided Internet services through a small wireless application in certain areas in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The transaction was closed on January 24, 2006. We agreed to pay a total purchase price of up to $710,633, payable as follows: (i) $185,000 in cash payable in twelve equal monthly payments, the first installment was paid at closing, and as of December 31, 2006, the entire amount was paid in full and in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement; (ii) $255,633 in cash, paid at closing, to pay off the loan with the B&K Bank; (iii) 33,768 restricted shares of Common Stock and 24,053 warrants exercisable at $2.98 per share for a period of five years were issued to the shareholders of Canufly.net during May 2006.

The acquisition was not significant from an accounting perspective. Story Telecom On May 10, 2006, we, Story Telecom, Inc., Story Telecom Limited, Story Telecom (Ireland) Limited, Nir Davison, and Trecastle Holdings Limited, a company owned and controlled by Mr. Davison, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, we increased our ownership interest in Story Telecom from 39.2% to 69.6% in a cash transaction valued at $1,200,000. $900,000 of the total consideration was applied to payables owed by Story Telecom to us and our subsidiary Swiftnet Limited for back-end telecommunications services. The balance of $300,000 was paid to Story Telecom to be used as working capital. Story Telecom, Inc., a telecommunication service provider, operated in the United Kingdom through its two wholly owned subsidiaries, Story Telecom Limited and Story Telecom (Ireland) Limited (which was dissolved on February 23, 2007). Following the acquisition, Story Telecom operates as a division of our operations in the United Kingdom. The stock purchase pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement was completed on May 16, 2006. The transaction contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement was not significant from an accounting perspective. On March 25, 2008, we purchased from Mr. Davison and Trecastle Holdings Limited, the shares of common stock of Story Telecom, Inc. that each party owned, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of £270,000 ($531,209), pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement entered into between the parties on that date. Upon acquisition of the shares of common stock of Story Telecom, Inc. from Mr. Davison and Trecastle Holdings, Story Telecom, Inc. became our wholly owned subsidiary. -34- Equitalk.co.uk Limited On May 25, 2006, we and the shareholders of Equitalk.co.uk Limited, a privately held telephone company based in the United Kingdom (“Equitalk”) entered into an Agreement relating to the sale and purchase of Equitalk (the “Equitalk Agreement”). The Equitalk Agreement provided for us to acquire Equitalk in a restricted Common Stock and warrant transaction valued at $1,650,000. The acquisition was completed on July 3, 2006, and on that date Equitalk became our wholly owned subsidiary. In conjunction with the completion of the acquisition and in exchange for all of the capital stock of Equitalk, we issued a total of 402,192 restricted shares of our Common Stock and a total of 281,872 warrants exercisable at $3.025 per share for a period of five years. Founded in December 1999, Equitalk, a VC-financed company, was the first fully automated e-telco in the United Kingdom.

Auracall Limited On August 15, 2007, the Company, Swiftnet Limited, our wholly owned U.K.-based subsidiary (“Swiftnet”), and Dan Kirschner entered into a definitive Share Purchase Agreement to be completed on the same date, pursuant to which Swiftnet purchased from Mr. Kirschner the 67.5% equity interest in Auracall Limited (“Auracall”) that he beneficially owned, thereby increasing Swiftnet’s ownership interest in Auracall from 32.5% to 100%. Swiftnet had acquired the 32.5% interest in Auracall through several transactions that occurred since October 16, 2001. The purchase price for the shares was £810,917.64 (approximately $1,595,432), payable as follows: £500,000 (approximately $983,720) was paid in cash upon signing of the Share Purchase Agreement, and the remaining £304,000, plus interest of £6,917.64 (approximately $655,896), was payable in monthly installments beginning in September 2007 and continued through March 2008. In connection with the acquisition, Auracall and Swiftnet entered into an Inter-Company Loan Agreement, pursuant to which Auracall agreed to lend Swiftnet £850,000 (approximately $1,672,324) for the sole purpose of and in connection with Swiftnet’s acquisition of the Auracall shares. The loan is unsecured, bears interest at a rate of 5% per annum, and is to be repaid in five years (i.e., August 15, 2012), but may be repaid earlier without charge or penalty. As a result of the terms of the transaction, Mr. Kirschner no longer serves as Auracall’s Managing Director or as a member of its board of directors. NTS Communications, Inc. On August 22, 2007, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “NTS Purchase Agreement”) with NTS Communications, Inc. (“NTS”), a provider of integrated voice, data and video solutions headquartered in Lubbock, Texas, and the owners of approximately 85% of the equity interests in NTS, to acquire NTS. Subsequently, all of the remaining shareholders of NTS executed the Agreement, bringing the total percentage of equity interests in NTS owned by NTS shareholders that entered into the Agreement (the “NTS Sellers”) to 100%. On February 14, 2008, we entered into a First Amendment to the NTS Purchase Agreement to amend the agreement to further extend the expiration date for the closing of our acquisition of NTS. On February 26, 2008, we entered into a Second Amendment to the NTS Purchase Agreement which amended, among other things, the definition and elements of working capital, as such term is defined in the NTS Purchase Agreement, and increased the escrow amount.

Wallace Company, Inc., Midcom of Arizona, Inc., Communications Brokers, Inc., NTS Telephone Company, LLC, and NTS Management Company, LLC, became our wholly owned subsidiaries. -35- The purchase price for the acquisition set forth in the NTS Purchase Agreement was approximately $42,000,000 (excluding acquisition related costs), plus (or less) (i) the difference between NTS’ estimated working capital and the working capital target for NTS as set forth in the NTS Purchase Agreement, and (ii) the difference between amounts allocated by NTS for its fiber optic network build-out project anticipated in Texas and any indebtedness incurred by NTS in connection with this project, each of which was subject to our advance written approval. After applying this formula, the final aggregate purchase price was calculated as $41,900,000, and was paid as follows: · $35,414,715 was paid in cash; and · 2,366,892 shares of our Common Stock were issued to certain NTS Sellers who elected to reinvest all or a portion of their allocable sale price in our Common Stock, pursuant to the terms of the NTS Purchase Agreement. Our Board of Directors determined, in accordance with the NTS Purchase Agreement, the number of shares of our Common Stock to be delivered to each participating NTS Seller by dividing the portion of such NTS Seller’s allocable sale price that the NTS Seller elected to receive in shares of our Common Stock by 93% of the average closing price of our Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange for the ten consecutive trading days preceding the trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date (i.e., $2.74). The aggregate sales price reinvested by all such NTS Sellers was $6,485,284. Recent Developments On March 17, 2008, Xfone 018 entered into an Agreement of Principles with Tiv Taam Holdings 1 Ltd., an Israeli public company (“Tiv Taam”), pursuant to which Xfone 018 agreed to purchase from Tiv Taam, and Tiv Taam agreed to sell to Xfone 018, approximately 89% of the outstanding share capital (approximately 69% of its fully diluted share capital) of Robomatix Technologies Ltd. (“Robomatix”) which Tiv Taam currently owns. Robomatix owns approximately 90% of the issued share capital of Tadiran Telecom-Communication Services In Israel Ltd. (“Tadiran Telecom”), which is the general partner of Tadiran Telecom-Communication Services In Israel – Limited Partnership (“Tadiran Telecom LP”), an Israeli entity dealing with the distribution, maintenance, assistance services and sale of switchboards for the business community in Israel. Accordingly, upon consummation of the acquisition, Xfone 018 will also acquire control over Tadiran Telecom and Tadiron Telecom LP. The purchase price for the acquisition is NIS 44,000,000 (approximately $12,611,063), subject to adjustment as set forth in the agreement, payable in three installments, as follows: · On the closing date, NIS 15,500,000 (approximately $4,442,534) (the “First Installment”); · By November 20, 2008, NIS 15,500,000 (approximately $4,442,534), subject to adjustment resulting from linkage to the Consumer Price Index (the “Second Installment”); and · By November 1, 2009, NIS 13,000,000 (approximately $3,725,996), subject to adjustment resulting from linkage to the Consumer Price Index (the “Third Installment”). Xfone 018 will have all rights as a shareholder of Robomatix upon closing of the acquisition and payment of the First Installment. We, as the parent company of Xfone 018, have agreed to sign a letter of guarantee with respect to the Second Installment and the Third Installment. The agreement provides for a 60-day period during which Xfone 018 shall perform a legal and accounting due diligence examination of Robomatix, Tadiran Telecom and Tadiran Telecom LP. Xfone 018 has undertaken to maintain confidentiality of all information delivered to Xfone 018, and has entered into a Confidentiality Undertaking. The closing of the transaction will occur on the later of (i) 75 days after the execution of the Agreement (i.e, May 31, 2008), or (ii) 15 days after receipt of necessary approvals of the General Director of the Antitrust Authority and other Israeli governmental authorities. In the event that the necessary approvals are not received within 120 days of the date of execution of the Agreement, or a reserved approval was received or an approval under conditions which make it burdensome on Xfone 018 or significantly prejudice the profitability of the transaction for Xfone 018, the Agreement will be null and void as if it was never executed. -36- Our Principal Services and Their Markets United Kingdom We provide through our United Kingdom operations (Swiftnet, Equitalk, Story Telecom and Auracall) the following telecommunication products / services: Services provided by Swiftnet Telephony Services · Carrier Pre Select (CPS): CPS is a telephony service which enables customers to benefit from our low call usage charges, without having to make any changes to their existing telephone lines or numbers.

Our US based subsidiary, Xfone USA, Inc. owns and operates its own facilities-based telecommunications carrier class-switching platform.

Future Plans Levelland/Smyer FTTP Opportunity NTS, through its wholly owned subsidiary, NTS Telephone Company, LLC, plans to extend its FTTP network to the nearby communities of Levelland (located 30 miles west of Lubbock) and Smyer (approximately 15 miles west of Lubbock). Upon project completion, these communities will add approximately 6,200 passings to the NTS FTTP footprint and bring total FTTP passings to approximately 21,000. NTS Telephone Company, LLC, has received approval from the Rural Utilities Service (“RUS”) for an $11.8 million, 17-year debt financing to complete this overbuild. The RUS loan is non-recourse to NTS and all other NTS subsidiaries and interest is charged at the average rate of U.S. government obligations (equivalent to approximately 4.5% a year at today’s rates). Data from marketing surveys indicated a very strong demand for triple play (voice, data/Internet, and video) service offerings and projected a market penetration for NTS of 69% in approximately three years from project completion. NTS’ capital investment in the project is a $2.5 million equity contribution that serves as credit support for the loan. NTS will provision voice, data, and video services for NTS Telephone Company. NTS will receive a management fee from NTS Telephone Service equal to 15% of its revenues. NTS expects to begin providing initial triple-play service to some areas of Levelland in the fourth quarter of 2008 with more areas becoming available as overbuild construction is completed. Project completion could be delayed by any number of factors including but not limited to weather and the availability of contractors and materials.

We offer for sale or rent two types of SIM Cards - a local SIM Card which may be used only from a specific country, and a global SIM Card which may be used from over 90 countries around the globe. · International Telephony Access: We provide international telephony access to the Israeli telephone network by selling incoming call minutes to various international operators across the globe. -40- Internet Based Customer Service · Our Internet based customer service and on-line registration (found at www.018.co.il) includes full details on all our products and services. Our Israel based subsidiary Xfone 018 owns and operates its own facilities-based telecommunications carrier class-switching platform. Our Distribution and Marketing Methods We use the following distribution methods to market our services: · We use employed, direct sales executives to sell to medium to large size business customers; these sales executives have quota attainment requirements and receive a monthly salary, allowance and are paid commissions; · We actively recruit independent contractor agents and resellers who purchase telephone traffic directly from us at a discount, and who then resell this telephone traffic to their customers at a mark-up according to their own price lists; · We utilize agents that sell our services directly to customers at our established prices; these agents receive a commission of approximately 5%-12% of the total sale amount less any bad debts; · We use third party direct sales organizations (telesales and door-to-door) to register new customers; · We cooperate with major companies and worker’s councils; · We have retail and wholesale sales offices; employees at these sales offices receive annual salaries and commissions; · We use direct marketing, including by newspaper, radio and television advertisements; · We attend telecommunications trade shows to promote our services; and · We utilize the Internet as an additional distribution channel for our services. Our Billing Practices We charge our customers based on a monthly fixed amount or on actual usage by full or partial minutes. Our rates vary with distance, duration, time, type of call, and product or service provided, but are not dependent upon the facilities selected for the call transmission. The standard terms for our customers require either pre-payments or payments due as early as 16 or as late as 30 days from the date of the invoice, or within 90 days from when the invoice is issued by the local operator. Our supplier’s standard terms are payment within 30 to 90 days from invoice date; however, some new suppliers ask for shorter payment terms. Carriers and Negotiating Lower Rates Our increased sales in 2006 and 2007 have enabled us to negotiate significantly lower rates with the carriers we use to carry our international call traffic, which gives us the opportunity to increase our margins or offer significant reductions to secure deals with major clients. If our sales increase, we anticipate that we will continue to negotiate for lower rates. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating lower rates. -41- Divisions We operate the following divisions: · Partner Division – Our Partner Division operates as a separate profit center by attempting to recruit new resellers and agents to market our products and services and to provide support and guidance to resellers and agents. · Customer Service Division – In the United Kingdom and the United States we operate a live customer service center that operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Geographic Markets Our primary geographic markets are the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel. However, we serve customers worldwide. Competitive Business Conditions The U.K. Market The communications and information services industry in the U.K. is highly competitive and varied. In 2007, we had only approximately 0.2% of the market share of the United Kingdom telecommunication market (not including mobiles revenues), based on our revenues of $24 million during 2007, compared with the approximately $10 billion telecommunication market (not including mobiles revenues) in the United Kingdom, according to the United Kingdom regulatory oversight of these companies, the Office of Communications - United Kingdom, otherwise known as Ofcom, the website of which may be accessed at www.ofcom.org.uk. The U.S. Market NTS operates in a highly competitive environment which is generally characterized by the dominance of the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC). With respect to its primary Texas markets, the dominant ILEC is AT&T (formerly Southwestern Bell Telephone Company). NTS also competes with the Incumbent Cable TV Provider (ICTVP) in markets where that carrier provides voice, data and/or video services. In its core Texas markets, the ICTVP is SuddenLink Communications or Time Warner Communications. Within these same core markets, NTS also competes with a variety of widely dispersed smaller Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLEC). In the February 2007 FCC report, Trends in Telephone Service – Industry Analysis and Technology Division, Wireline Competition Bureau, it is reported that total Texas switched access lines in service (as of June 30, 2006) were 11,863,981, with the ILEC community possessing a market share of approximately 84% and the balance is being served by various CLEC’s and ICTVP’s. With respect to its data and long distance products, the company competes with various national and regional players including AT&T, Verizon, Qwest, Level 3 and others. In 2007, Xfone USA had approximately 11,000 End-User Switched Access telephone lines in the Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi market or approximately 0.2% of market share. This total market size in 2007 represented 5,732,998 telephone lines, with BellSouth Telecommunications maintaining its monopoly market share with 4,949,629 telephone lines or approximately 86% of the market. All CLECs combined made up the remaining 783,369 telephone lines or approximately 14% of the tri-state market, according to the 2007 FCC Report - Trends in Local Telephone Competition. -42- The Israeli Market Since the opening of the international telephony market in Israel to competition in 1996, and until 2004, only three companies have provided international telephony services in Israel. The market, estimated at that time to be 2 billion minutes per year, was more or less equally divided between the three companies. On July 4, 2004, the Ministry of Communications of the State of Israel granted our subsidiary, Xfone 018 a license to provide international telecom services in Israel. We started providing services in Israel through Xfone 018 as of mid-December 2004. In 2004, two other new providers of international telephony services launched their services. The international telephony market is highly competitive and therefore all six providers had to offer low prices in order to attract or retain subscribers and call minutes. During 2006, two significant mergers occurred in the Israeli international telephony market, leaving only four companies in the competition. The aforementioned mergers enabled Xfone 018 to execute, as of December 2006, a new business strategy, according to which it re-priced its services by distinguishing the rates for its subscribed customers from the rates for its non-subscribed customers. The new strategy has proved to be successful, and in 2007 Xfone 018 revenues were significantly increased. In 2007, the Israeli international telephony market was estimated to be 2.9 billion minutes. We estimate our market share as of December 31, 2007, as approximately 5.5% of the Israeli market. Principal Suppliers In 2007, our principal suppliers of telephone routing and switching services according to the percentage of the costs of revenues were: · AT&T Inc. - 25% · British Telecommunications - 20% · Bezeq The Israel Telecommunication Corp - 7% We are dependent on several of our suppliers, including those that provide significant hardware and software products and support. However, these suppliers are required to provide us with services according to the relevant regulations and their licenses to operate as a telecommunications provider in the relevant jurisdictions. Major Customers We have six major types of customers: · Residential – in the U.S. - pre-subscribed customers, including for local, long distance, internet and cable television services; outside of the U.S. - pre-subscribed customers and customers who must dial a special code to access our switch or acquire a box that dials automatically. · Commercial – we serve small to complex business customers around the world. · Governmental agencies – Including the United Nations World Economic Forum, certain embassies and the Bank of Israel. We also provide cities, counties, schools and universities in Texas with a host of services, including local, long distance, internet and private line services. · Resellers – We provide resellers with our telephone and messaging services for a wholesale price. We also provide long haul switched termination to a variety of companies throughout the United States who resell our services. · Telecommunications companies – We provide our services through telecommunication companies (such as British Telecom and Bezeq The Israel Telecommunication Corp) which collect the fees relating to such services and forward them to us. · Mobile Users – including customers who can access our switch utilizing our access number and thereafter are able to make low-cost international calls; customers who purchase, via a reversed billed SMS, pre-paid credit for international calls and those using our international roaming SIM cards. -43- Certain Telecommunication operators act as collection channels for the Company. In 2007, we had two major collection channels, one in the U.K. and one in Israel. Collections through these channels accounted to approximately 22% and 6% of our total revenues in 2007, respectively, and 18% and 5% of our total revenues in 2006, respectively. With respect to collection of monies for us, these Telecommunication operators are not deemed to be customers of the Company. In 2007 our largest non-affiliated reseller was WorldNet Global Communications Ltd. which generated under 1% of our total revenues. We provide WorldNet Global Communications with the billing system. We anticipate that WorldNet will continue to contribute approximately the same amount of UKP to our revenues in year 2008. Collectively, in 2007 the United Kingdom accounts for approximately 54.3% of our revenues, the United States accounts for approximately 27.5% of our revenues and Israel accounts for approximately 18.2% of our revenues. Our integrated revenue approach led to revenue from each source as described above and is partially driven by the activities of other revenue sources. Our revenues are dependent upon the following factors: price competition in telephone rates; access provided to our services by other telecoms companies and the prices for that access; demand for our services; individual economic conditions in our markets; and our ability to market our services. Patents and Trademarks In the U.K On September 14, 2000, Equitalk received notification from the Trademarks Registry Office of Great Britain that its trademark, “ Equitalk ,” was registered by that government agency. On January 9, 2004, we received notification from the Trademarks Registry Office of Great Britain that as of August 8, 2003, our trademark, “ Xfone ,” was registered by that government agency.

We do not have any other patents or registered trademarks. Regulatory Matters We provide our services in many countries, all of which have different regulations, standards and controls related to licensing, telecommunications, import/export, currency and trade. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations. In the U.K In 1996, our subsidiary, Swiftnet Limited was granted a license to operate a telecommunications system from the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry of the United Kingdom. On July 25, 2003, the regulatory situation within the United Kingdom changed dramatically with the ending of the licensing regime and the withdrawal and revocation of the Telecommunication Act. The licensing regime has been replaced by a general authorization regime with the introduction of the General Conditions of Entitlement. Swiftnet Limited, Equitalk.co.uk Limited, Auracall Limited and Story Telecom Limited are now affected by regulations introduced by the Office of Communications (“Ofcom”). Ofcom is the regulator for the UK communications industries, with responsibilities across television, radio, telecommunications and wireless communications services. Our UK businesses are also affected by the rules set by regulator for Premium Rate Services (Phonepay Plus - www.phonepayplus.org.uk). We do not believe that any regulations introduced by Ofcom or Phonepay Plus will significantly interfere with or substantially impair our business. In the U.S Xfone USA is licensed as a CLEC and an Inter-exchange Carrier to provide local telephone and long distance services in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi. Internet and data services provided by Xfone USA are not regulated services. As of March 10, 2005, and upon consummation of the merger of WS Telecom, with and into Xfone USA, we became subject to applicable US state and federal telecommunications laws and regulations. Compliance with such laws involved higher costs than we had in Europe. On March 9, 2005, the Mississippi Public Service Commission (“MSPSC”) issued an Order opening a Generic Change of Law Proceeding (“MSPSC Proceeding”) to consider amendments to existing Interconnection Agreements between BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. and all (CLECs) in Mississippi. As an interested party and as a CLEC, Xfone USA petitioned and was granted permission to intervene in the MSPSC Proceeding for regulatory purposes. On October 26, 2005, the MSPSC held its hearing on the MSPSC Proceeding and took the results of the proceeding under advisement. On October 20, 2006 the MSPSC issued its Order in this matter, requiring various changes to Interconnection Agreements between BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. and all CLECs in Mississippi, including the Interconnection Agreement under which Xfone USA operates. The issues addressed by the MSPSC in this proceeding were regulatory in nature and did not involve monetary damages. -45- From time to time Xfone USA may be required to seek regulatory approval before applicable state public utility commissions of certain transactions, including business combinations with other telecommunications providers. During 2005, upon request of Xfone USA, the MSPSC and the Louisiana Public Service Commission granted regulatory approval of the sale and transfer of the assets and the customer base of I-55 Telecommunications to Xfone USA. This transaction was closed on March 31, 2006. It has come to our attention that certain required annual regulatory reports with the MSPSC may not have been made in a timely manner. We are currently evaluating all required reports, and are working diligently to remediate any such omissions. Xfone USA could face a potential penalty and/or revocation of its certificate as a result of the late filings. On February 14, 2008, Xfone and NTS received domestic and international Section 214 authorization from the United States Federal Communications Commission to transfer control of NTS to the Company. NTS has certain domestic and international Section 214 authority, which authorizes NTS to provide long distance service in the United States. NTS is registered re-seller of long-distance services in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. NTS is also registered to provide local services in New Mexico and Texas. Further, in Texas, NTS has the authority to provide local telecommunications services throughout the state of Texas, to provide cable television services in Lubbock and Wollforth, and has permits to provide video services in designated areas within Lubbock, Wolfforth, Smyer and Levelland. In addition, NTS has entered into 9-1-1 Emergency Service Agreements with the applicable 9-1-1 entities in the markets it serves. Effect of Probable Governmental Regulations As an ETC (Eligible Telecommunications Carrier), there are numerous actions proposed at both the state and federal level which could limit NTS’ future access to reimbursement from various Universal Service Funds (“USF”). NTS currently only receives minimal reimbursement from USF for its provision of Lifeline and LinkUp services. However, these measures could limit NTS ability to obtain reimbursement for services provided in high cost areas. NTS continues to rely on AT&T for access to high cap interoffice and last mile copper loop facilities. AT&T’s obligation to provide these facilities is created by the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and corresponding regulations of the FCC and memorialized in interconnection agreements between NTS and Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers. Should laws or regulations be changed to limit and or eliminate competitive access to these essential facilities, NTS business could be adversely affected. The FCC has been considering access charge reform to address issues created by VoIP traffic, namely the compensation due, if any, to terminating carriers for VoIP originated calls. Resolution of this issue will clarify legal and regulatory uncertainty about the treatment of these calls and could have the effect of opening the door to new markets for NTS’ wholesale switched services. At the state level, the Texas State PUC has implemented rules which may result in the reduction of NTS’ intrastate access revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008. In Israel On April 15, 2004, we established Xfone Communication Ltd. and renamed it to Xfone 018 Ltd in March 2005. On July 4, 2004 the Ministry of Communications of the State of Israel (the "MOCSIL") granted Xfone 018 a license to provide international telecom services in Israel (the "International Telecommunications Services License"). The International Telecommunications Services License may be revoked by this agency in the occurrence of certain events such as breach of telecommunication laws and regulations or breach of certain provisions of the license. On May 31, 2006, Xfone 018 was granted permission by the MOCSIL to commence an experimental deployment of International Telephone Services utilizing Voice over Broadband (VoB) technology. On May 31, 2007 the permission expired. The MOCSIL is currently evaluating an amendment to the International Telecommunications Services License, which would, if adopted, include Voice over Broadband (VoB) technology within our International Telecommunications Services License. -46- On August 21, 2006, the MOCSIL granted Xfone 018 a license to operate in Israel as an ISP, thus enabling Xfone 018 to provide Internet access, Email and EDI (electronic data interchange) services. On November 7, 2007, the MOCSIL granted Xfone 018 a license to commence an experimental deployment of Local Telephone Services utilizing Voice over Broadband (VoB) technology. The license will expire on May 31, 2008. On May 24, 2007, the MOCSIL informed Xfone 018 that it is considering imposing on it a financial sanction as a result of Xfone 018’s failure to provide the new "Mobilization of Telephone Numbers" service (the "Service"), as of September 1, 2006, as required by law. On June 14, 2007, Xfone 018 responded to the MOCSIL and explained the reasons for the delay in the implementation of the Service, In December 2007, the Service was implemented in Israel by all telecom service providers, including Xfone 018. Xfone 018 has not received any additional communications from the MOCSIL in this regard since its implementation of the Service, and accordingly, believes the matter to be resolved. Effect of Probable Governmental Regulations There are numerous actions recently proposed by the Grunow Committee, an advisory committee appointed by the Ministry of Communications of the State of Israel, which could affect our business in the future. Below are the significant recommendations of the committee that could apply to us if adopted: · Naked ADSL: A proposal has been made to separate between the telephony and internet access in the "Last Mile". If adopted, this could be beneficial to Xfone 018, as it would provide Xfone 018 with the opportunity to penetrate the market with its VOB local calls services. · Unbundling: A proposal has been made to force the existing infrastructure providers to enable other providers to use their infrastructure in fair prices to encourage competition. If adopted, this could affect Xfone 018’s business by allowing it to offer a wider range of services at attractive prices. · MVNO: A proposal has been made to open the Israeli market to new virtual players in the mobile arena. If adopted, this could affect Xfone 018’s business by allowing it to penetrate a new market, which constitutes more than 50% of the Israeli communication market. · International Calls: A proposal has been made to enable mobile operators to supply international calls based on agreed access charge from the international carriers. If adopted, this could negatively affect Xfone 018’s business by enlarging the number of its competitors. · WIMAX: A proposal has been made to issue WIMAX frequencies in order to establish new access networks in Israel. If adopted, this could be beneficial to Xfone 018’s business by allowing it to penetrate and gain a new market share by direct access. Research and Development Activities During fiscal year 2006, we spent £23,333 ($49,101) on research and development activities. During fiscal year 2007, we spent £23,794 ($47,609) on research and development activities. During the first quarter of 2008 we spent £13,830 ($29,175) on research and development activities. Other than developing and expanding our telecommunications applications and our websites, we do not intend to undertake any significant research and development activities in 2008. Cost of Compliance with Environmental Laws During 2007, NTS incurred approximately $31,000 expenses related to the encapsulation of asbestos insulation located on certain of the basement piping and basement boiler jacket of the Metro Tower, a property owned in Lubbock, Texas, and in connection with the replacement of the roof of the building to remediate a potential interior mold problem with originated from a roof leak. NTS will from time to time incur additional similar expenses in the future to monitor and encapsulate, where necessary, isolated areas of asbestos. On March 21, 2008, NTS received notice that the remediation project at Metro Tower had been completed, and accordingly does not anticipate significant future expenses related to mold remediation at this property over and above those normally associated with customary and usual building maintenance. -47- We currently have no other costs associated with compliance with environmental regulations. We do not anticipate any other future costs associated with environmental compliance; however, there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in the future. Employees We currently have 32 employees in the United Kingdom, 357 in the United States, and 47 employees in Israel.

FCC Enforcement Bureau On March 6, 2006, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau initiated an investigation into Telephone Electronic Company’s (“TEC”) compliance with FCC Rules for compensation of payphone service providers. The Enforcement Bureau issued requests for production to TEC, its affiliates and subsidiaries. TEC was a majority shareholder of NTS Communications, Inc. ("NTS") at the time of this investigation, prior to our acquisition of NTS on February 26, 2008. On April 26, 2006, NTS filed its response to the request for production. The FCC has the authority to issue fines for violations of its regulations. NTS believes it is in compliance and will not incur any fine. The investigation is pending. II. David Espinoza vs. NTS Communications, Inc. and Schindler Elevator Corp. On June 29, 2007, David Espinoza filed a personal injury suit against NTS Communications, Inc. (“NTS”), a wholly-owned U.S. based subsidiary of the Company as of February 26, 2008, and Schindler Elevator Corp., in the 237th District Court of Lubbock County, Texas. Espinoza was an employee of one of the tenants in Metro Tower, a building owned by NTS Communications. The complaint alleges that the claim arises from an incident that occurred on July 20, 2005 when Espinoza fell in an elevator at Metro Tower and sustained injuries to his knee and shoulder. Espinoza is seeking unspecified damages for personal injuries. The case is set for mediation in April 2008 and jury trial the week of July 21, 2008.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Xfone, Inc. as of December 31, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We did not audit the financial statements of Xfone 018, Ltd., a 69% owned subsidiary, which statements reflect 5.5% of total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2007 and 18.3% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. Those financial statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Xfone 018, Ltd. as of December 31, 2007 and for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 is based solely on the report of the other auditor. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

F-13 Xfone, Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies The financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements, applied on a consistent basis, are as follows: A. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Financial Statement Presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. A minority interest in the loss of a subsidiary will be recorded according to the respective equity interest of the minority and up to its exposure and/or legal obligation to cover the subsidiary losses in case of equity reduced to zero or below. B. Foreign Cur rency Translation Effective January 1, 2007, the Company changed its functional and reporting currency from the Great Britain Pounds ("GBP") to the U.S. dollar for the reason that a majority of the Company's transactions and balances are denominated in U.S. dollars. Consistent with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation (“SFAS No. 52”), the change in functional currency will be accounted for prospectively; therefore, there is no effect on the historical consolidated financial statements. The translated amounts for non-monetary assets at December 31, 2006, became the accounting basis for those assets as of January 1, 2007. The determination of the functional currency for the Company's foreign subsidiaries is made based on the appropriate economic factors. In addition a substantial portion of the Company's costs are incurred in U.S. dollars. The Company's management believes that the U.S. dollar is the primary currency of the economic environment in which it operate. Thus, the Company's functional and reporting currency and the functional and reporting currency of certain of its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, monetary accounts maintained in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are re-measured into U.S. dollars in accordance with SFAS No. 52. All gains and losses of the re-measurement of monetary balance sheet items are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as financial income or expenses as appropriate. The Company's functional currency is US$, the Company's financial records are maintained in US$, and the Company's financial statements are prepared in US$. The functional currency of Swiftnet, Equitalk, Story Telecom and Auracall is GBP, the financial records of these subsidiaries are maintained in GBP and the financial statements of these subsidiaries are prepared in GBP. The functional currency of Xfone 018 is New Israeli Shekels ("NIS"), the financial records of Xfone 018 are maintained in NIS, and the financial statements of Xfone 018 are prepared in NIS. Foreign currency transactions during the period are translated into each company's denominated currency at the exchange rates ruling at the transaction dates. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statement of operations. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into each company's denominated currency at period-end exchange rates. All exchange differences are dealt with in the consolidated statements of operations. The financial statements of the Company's operations based outside of the United States have been translated into US$ in accordance with SFAS No. 52. When translating functional currency financial statements into US$, period-end exchange rates are applied to the consolidated balance sheets, while average period rates are applied to consolidated statements of operations. Translation gains and losses are recorded in translation reserve as a component of shareholders' equity. C. Restricted c ash Restricted cash include proceeds from the issuance of securities to Israeli institutional investors, for total gross proceeds of NIS 100,382,100 (approximately $25,562,032) par value bonds (Series A). The proceeds were invested in weekly interest-bearing deposits and were transferred to the Company's control upon the fulfillment of the following conditions: (i) that the Company raises an aggregate of at least $20.0 million in equity financings; and (ii) that the conditions for the consummation of the acquisition of NTS Communications, Inc have been met. These conditions were satisfied during February 2008 (See also Note 18).

Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value consisting of the carrying amount less the allowance for uncollectible accounts. The Company uses the allowance method to account for uncollectible accounts receivable balances. Under the allowance method, estimate of uncollectible customer balances is made using factors such as the credit quality of the customer and the economic conditions in the market. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined with respect to those amounts that the Company has determined to be doubtful of collection. When an account balance is past due and attempts have been made to collect the receivable through legal or other means the amount is considered uncollectible and is written off against the allowance balance. As of December 31, 2007 the accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,090,572. Bad debt expenses for the years ended 2007 and 2006 are $641,477 and $290,998 respectively. E. Fixed Assets Fixed Assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated based on a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Annual rates of depreciation are as follows: Useful Life Communication equipment 10 years Equipment held under lease 4 years Office furniture and equipment 4-14 years Development costs 3 years Computer equipment 3-4 years Motor vehicles 4 years Building and plant 4-14 years Depreciation expenses amounted to $1,044,722 and $833,541 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. F-15 F. Other I ntangible A ssets Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of license for communication services and are amortized over the 20 year term of the license. Customer base and trade name related to merger and acquisitions are amortized over a period between 6-7 years from the date of the purchase. Amortization expenses amounted to $167,076 and $258,544 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. G. Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets with determinable lives) whenever event or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. The Company evaluates events or changes in circumstances based on a number of factors including operating results, business plans and forecasts, general and industry trends and, economic projections and anticipated cash flows. Impairment, if any, is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in earnings. The Company also continually evaluates the estimated useful lives of all long-lived assets and periodically revises such estimates based on current events. F-16 Xfone, Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies (Cont.) H. Revenue Recognition The Company's source of revenues results from charges to customers for the call minutes they use while on the Company's telecommunications system. Such revenues are recognized at the time this service is rendered. Amounts prepaid by customers are deferred and recorded as a liability and then recorded as revenue when the customer utilizes the service. Messaging services customers are being charged on a per minute basis, per fax page or email. Commissions to agents are accounted as marketing costs for the Company. Revenue for services is recognized when the related services are provided. Payments received in advance are deferred until the service is provided. I. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. J. Earnings Per Share Basic earning per share (EPS) is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity. K. Income Taxes Deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporarily differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting and are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. L. Stock-Based Compensation Effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”) using the modified prospective transition method. The Company previously applied APB 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures required under SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”). The Company elected to adopt the modified prospective application method as provided by SFAS 123(R), and, accordingly, the Company recorded compensation costs as the requisite service rendered for the unvested portion of previously issued awards that remain outstanding at the initial date of adoption and any awards issued, modified, repurchased or cancelled after the effective date of SFAS 123(R). The Company use the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates, including estimates of the expected term participants will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of its common stock price over the expected term, and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. M. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (“SFAS No. 142”), goodwill acquired in business combination is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination as of the acquisition date. The company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually at the end of each year and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred in accordance with SFAS No. 142. SFAS 142 also requires that the fair value of indefinite-lived purchased intangible assets be estimated and compared to the carrying value. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived purchased intangible assets is less than the carrying value. No impairment was recorded at December 31, 2007 and 2006. F-17 Xfone, Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies (Cont.) N. Reclassification Certain prior period balances in the consolidated statement of cash flows were reclassified to appropriately present net cash used in operating activities and effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. The reclassification had no effect on previously reported net income and shareholders' equity. O. Re cent Accounting Pronouncements 1) SFAS 157 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (“SFAS No. 157”) which provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable. SFAS No. 157 also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measures on earnings. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued in fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and to interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on its consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 2) SFAS 159 In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value. The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings for items measured using the fair value option. SFAS No. 159 is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 will not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 3) SFAS 141 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141(R)). Under SFAS No. 141(R), an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. It further requires that acquisition-related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred, restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense. The adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will change the Company’s accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis for those acquisitions being consummated beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. 4) SAB 110 In December 2007, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 110 ("SAB 110") to amend the SEC’s views discussed in Staff Accounting Bulletin 107 (SAB 107) regarding the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected life of share options in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). SAB 110 is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. The adoption of SAB 110 will not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In conjunction with this financial transaction, we issued to Laurus Master Fund 157,500 warrants which are exercisable at $3.80 per share for a period of five years. The closing of the financial transaction was on September 28, 2005. The Securities Purchase Agreement provides that for so long as twenty five percent (25%) of the principal amount of the Term Note is outstanding, the Company, without the prior written consent of Laurus Master Fund, shall not, and shall not permit any of the Subsidiaries (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) to directly or indirectly declare or pay any dividends, other than dividends paid to the Company or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries. 2.

SFAS No. 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forward. The Company does not file consolidated tax returns. The following table reflects the Company's deferred tax assets and (liabilities): Deferred Tax Liabilities: Accelerated tax write off of fixed assets $ 1,103 Deferred Tax Assets: Carry forward losses 363,768 Accrued vacation and severance pay 67,108 Net deferred taxes liabilities $ 429,773 The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rates to income before taxes as follows: Income tax computed at statutory rate $ (628,809 ) Effect of tax authority adjustments 35,642 Current income (losses) for which no deferred tax expense (benefit) has been recorded 39,860 Difference between income reported for tax purposes and income for financial reporting purposes - net 30,073 Deferred taxes on losses (utilization of losses) (506,877 ) Taxes on losses for which a valuation allowance was not provided 603,686 Taxes in respect of prior years 320 Provision for income taxes $ (426,105 ) F-22 Xfone, Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 Note 11 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Swiftnet Limited, the Company’s wholly-owned U.K. based subsidiary, was served with a claim on October 11, 2005 that was filed by MCI WorldCom Limited (currently operating as Verizon UK Limited) (“MCI”) in an English court for the sum of £1,640,440 ($3,398,992) plus interest accruing at a daily rate of £401 ($831) which at the date of claim had amounted to £92,317 ($191,281). MCI’s claim was for telecommunication services provided to Swiftnet. Swiftnet had been in dispute with MCI regarding amounts due to MCI for telecommunications services provided by MCI to Swiftnet. Swiftnet alleged that the disputed charges were improperly billed by MCI to its account and therefore MCI should credit Swiftnet for a certain amount of the claim. A substantial element of Swiftnet’s counterclaim for credits was based upon special rates agreed verbally by Swiftnet and MCI, which were not applied by MCI in its invoices. Swiftnet pleaded a counterclaim and that £275,574 ($550,803) owed in relation to traffic terminated through the Xfone network in Israel should be deducted. On 19 March 2008, the court handed down judgment in this dispute and awarded £1,278,942 ($2,564,036) plus legal costs and interest in favour of MCI. The Company's financial statements have carried the full amount Swiftnet calculated that it owed to MCI based on the data held in Swiftnet’s billing systems. The net effect of this judgment including estimation of the Company's legal fees, MCI’s legal costs and interest payable is approximately £1,427,737 ($2,856,803) which is presented as a non-recurring loss in the Statement of Operations. Swiftnet is in the process of taking legal advice as to whether it will seek an appeal to the English Court of Appeal.

Wallace Company, Inc., Midcom of Arizona, Inc., Communications Brokers, Inc., NTS Telephone Company, LLC, and NTS Management Company, LLC, became our wholly owned subsidiaries. The purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $42,000,000 (excluding acquisition related costs), plus (or less) (i) the difference between NTS’ estimated working capital and the working capital target for NTS as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and (ii) the difference between amounts allocated by NTS for its fiber optic network build-out project anticipated in Texas and any indebtedness incurred by NTS in connection with this project, each of which was subject to the Company’s advance written approval. After applying this formula, the final aggregate purchase price was calculated as $41,900,000, and was paid by the Company as follows: $35,414,715 was paid in cash; and 2,366,892 shares of the Company’s common stock, were issued to certain NTS Shareholders who elected to reinvest all or a portion of their allocable sale price in the Company’s Common Stock, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The Company’s Board of Directors determined, in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock to be delivered to each participating NTS Shareholder by dividing the portion of such NTS Shareholder’s allocable sale price that the NTS Shareholder elected to receive in shares of the Company’s Common Stock by 93% of the average closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange for the ten consecutive trading days preceding the trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date (i.e., $2.74). The aggregate sales price reinvested by all such NTS Shareholders was $6,485,284. On February 26, 2008, and in connection with the closing of the acquisition, the parties entered into the following material definitive agreements, among others: A. Employment Agreements with Barb ara Baldwin, Jerry Hoover and Brad Worthington . NTS entered into Employment Agreements with each of Barbara Baldwin, who, prior to the closing, served as NTS’ President and CEO, Jerry Hoover, who, prior to the closing, served as NTS’ Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer, and Brad Worthington, who, prior to the closing, served as NTS’ Executive Vice President - Chief Operating Officer (each an “Officer,” and collectively the “Officers”). The Employment Agreements provide for continued employment of the Officers with NTS in their respective capacities, and are for five-year terms each, effective as of the Closing Date. The Employment Agreements provide for initial annual salaries for Ms. Baldwin of $273,000, and $243,840 for each of Messrs. Hoover and Worthington, and annual salaries (not less than the Officer’s respective initial annual salary) to be determined by NTS’ Board of Directors for each year of employment thereafter. In addition, the Officers are entitled to one-time signing bonuses in the amount of $500,000 for Ms. Baldwin and $243,840 for each of Messrs. Hoover and Worthington on the effective date of the Employment Agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreements, the Officers were granted the following stock option awards under the Company’s 2007 Stock Incentive Plan on the Closing Date: Ms. Baldwin was granted options to purchase 250,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, and each of Messrs. Hoover and Worthington was granted options to purchase 400,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. Each option is immediately exercisable, expires five years from the grant date, and has an exercise price of $2.794, which is 10% over the average closing price of the Company’s Common Stock for the ten trading days immediately preceding August, 22, 2007, the execution date of the Purchase Agreement. Additionally, the Employment Agreements provide that at the end of each Officer’s second year of his or her employment, he or she will be granted options to purchase 267,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, which will be immediately exercisable at $5.00 per share, and will expire five years from such grant date. The Employment Agreements also provide piggyback registration rights for the Officers from the effective date of the Employment Agreement through the expiration or termination of the Employment Agreements, to register for resale the shares of the Company’s Common Stock they own as a result of exercising any of the options granted pursuant to the Employment Agreements. The Company will pay the registration expenses with respect to such piggyback registrations. F-34 Xfone, Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 Note 18 - Subsequent Events (Cont.) B. Free Cash Flow Participation Agreement. The Company entered into a Free Cash Flow Participation Agreement (the “Participation Agreement”) with NTS Holdings, pursuant to which NTS Holdings will be entitled to a payment from the Company of an amount equal to 5% of the aggregate excess free cash flow generated by the Company’s U.S. Operations, which is defined in the Participation Agreement as the operations of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries, which include Xfone USA, Inc. and NTS, and their respective subsidiaries, as well as any U.S. entity that the Company acquires directly, or indirectly through its subsidiaries in the future (a “Future Acquisition”). NTS Holdings will be entitled to the participation amount beginning at such time as the Company has received a full return of its initial invested capital, plus an additional 8% return per year, in connection with the NTS acquisition (as well as in connection with any Future Acquisition). The Participation Agreement will remain in effect in perpetuity, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms. Termination of the Participation Agreement may occur upon a sale or buyout of the Company’s U.S. Operations, at the option of the purchaser in any such transaction, and in the limited circumstances set forth in the Participation Agreement. C. Escrow Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company and certain representatives of the NTS Shareholders (the “NTS Shareholder Representatives”) entered into an Escrow Agreement with Trustmark National Bank, as escrow agent, pursuant to which the Company deposited an amount of cash and shares of Common Stock equal to $6,679,999 (15.9%) of the aggregate purchase price for the acquisition, to be held and administered by the escrow agent in order to secure certain obligations of the sellers under the Purchase Agreement. Each share of Common Stock deposited with the escrow agent has an agreed value of $2.74, which was determined by using the average per share closing price of the Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive trading days preceding the trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date. D. Issuance of Common Stock to certain NTS Shareholders In connection with the closing of the acquisition on February 26, 2008, the Company issued 2,366,892 shares of the Company’s Common Stock to certain NTS Shareholders who elected to reinvest all or a portion of their allocable sale price in the Company’s Common Stock, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The Company’s Board of Directors determined, in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock to be delivered to each participating NTS Shareholder by dividing the portion of such NTS Shareholder’s allocable sale price that the NTS Shareholder elected to receive in shares of the Company’s Common Stock by 93% of the average closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange for the ten consecutive trading days preceding the trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date (i.e., $2.74). The aggregate sales price reinvested by all such NTS Shareholders was $6,485,284. E. Issuance of Common Stock to certain Accredited Investors pursuant to the December 13, 2007 Private Placement On February 26, 2008, the Company completed the issuance of 800,000 Units (as defined below) to XFN-RLSI Investments, LLC, an entity affiliated with Richard L. Scott Investments, LLC, a U.S. institutional investor, and 500,000 Units to certain investors affiliated with or who are customers of Gagnon Securities LLC, pursuant to Subscription Agreements entered into with each of the investors on December 13, 2007. Each “Unit” consists of two shares of the Company’s Common Stock and one warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock, exercisable for a period of five years from the date of issuance at an exercise price of $3.10 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $6.20 per Unit, for an aggregate purchase price of $8,060,000, which was held in escrow for the benefit of the Company pending the receipt by the Company of approvals from the American Stock Exchange and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange for the listing of the shares (including those underlying the warrants), as well as the closing of the acquisition of NTS. The private placement was made by the Company acting without a placement agent. F-35 Xfone, Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 Note 18 - Subsequent Events (Cont.) Letter agreement with Oberon Securities, LLC On March 5, 2008, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the “March 5, 2008 Agreement”) with Oberon Securities, LLC, a New York City-based registered broker-dealer (“Oberon Securities”), pursuant to which the Company will pay Oberon Securities $1,200,000 in cash for its services to the Company as financial advisor in connection with the Company's acquisition of NTS, payable as follows: (i) $400,000 no later than March 7, 2008 (ii) $400,000 no later than May 1, 2008 and (iii) $400,000 no later than July 1, 2008. The March 5, 2008 Agreement sets forth the total and final fees due to Oberon Securities for its services in connection with the NTS acquisition, pursuant to the Company’s prior agreements with Oberon Securities and its affiliates. Agreement of Principles with Tiv Taam Holdings 1 Ltd. On March 17, 2008, Xfone 018 entered into an Agreement of Principles with Tiv Taam Holdings 1 Ltd., an Israeli public company (“Tiv Taam”), pursuant to which Xfone 018 agreed to purchase from Tiv Taam, and Tiv Taam agreed to sell to Xfone 018, approximately 89% of the outstanding share capital (approximately 69% of its fully diluted share capital) of Robomatix Technologies Ltd. (“Robomatix”) which Tiv Taam currently owns. Robomatix owns approximately 90% of the issued share capital of Tadiran Telecom-Communication Services In Israel Ltd. (“Tadiran Telecom”), which is the general partner of Tadiran Telecom-Communication Services In Israel – Limited Partnership (“Tadiran Telecom LP”), an Israeli entity dealing with the distribution, maintenance, assistance services and sale of switchboards for the business community in Israel. Accordingly, upon consummation of the acquisition, Xfone 018 will also acquire control over Tadiran Telecom and Tadiron Telecom LP. The purchase price for the acquisition is NIS 44,000,000 (approximately $12,503,552), subject to adjustment as set forth in the agreement, payable in three installments, as follows: o On the closing date, NIS 15,500,000 (approximately $4,404,660) (the “First Installment”); o By November 20, 2008, NIS 15,500,000 (approximately $4,404,660), subject to adjustment resulting from linkage to the Consumer Price Index (the “Second Installment”); and o By November 1, 2009, NIS 13,000,000 (approximately $3,694,231), subject to adjustment resulting from linkage to the Consumer Price Index (the “Third Installment”). Xfone 018 will have all rights as a shareholder of Robomatix upon closing of the acquisition and payment of the First Installment. Xfone Inc., as the parent company of Xfone 018, has agreed to sign a letter of guarantee with respect to the Second Installment and the Third Installment. The agreement provides for a 60-day period during which Xfone 018 shall perform a legal and accounting due diligence examination of Robomatix, Tadiran Telecom and Tadiran Telecom LP. Xfone 018 has undertaken to maintain confidentiality of all information delivered to Xfone 018, and has entered into a Confidentiality Undertaking. The closing of the transaction will occur on the later of (i) 75 days after the execution of the Agreement (i.e, May 31, 2008), or (ii) 15 days after receipt of necessary approvals of the General Director of the Antitrust Authority and other Israeli governmental authorities. In the event that the necessary approvals are not received within 120 days of the date of execution of the Agreement, or a reserved approval was received or an approval under conditions which make it burdensome on Xfone 018 or significantly prejudice the profitability of the transaction for Xfone 018, the Agreement will be null and void as if it was never executed. F-36 Xfone, Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2007 Note 18 - Subsequent Events (Cont.) Acquisition of additional 30.4% ownership interest in Story Telecom, Inc. On July 12, 2007, Story Telecom UK notified Mr. Davison, its Managing Director, that it was terminating his employment, effective as of September 10, 2007. On July 25, 2007, the Company received notification of a claim filed on July 23, 2007 by Mr. Davison with the United Kingdom Employment Tribunals against Story Telecom UK, alleging wrongful termination of his employment as Managing Director. The claim did not seek any specific damages. On August 21, 2007, the Company responded to the United Kingdom Employment Tribunal by rejecting Mr. Davison's claim. On March 25, 2008, Story Telecom Limited (“Story Telecom UK”), the majority-owned U.K. based subsidiary of the Company, settled the previously disclosed legal proceeding in the U.K. initiated by Nir Davison, Story Telecom UK’s former Managing Director. In connection with the settlement, the Company purchased the shares of common stock of Story Telecom, Inc., the parent company of Story Telecom UK ("Story Telecom US"), owned by Mr. Davison and owned by Trecastle Holdings Limited, a company owned and controlled by Mr. Davison (“Trecastle”), which increased the Company's ownership interest in Story Telecom US from 69.6% to 100%. As a result, Story Telecom US became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As part of the settlement, Story Telecom UK agreed to pay Mr. Davison ₤30,000 ($59,787) as compensation for loss of employment, which payment was made without admission of liability. In addition, Mr. Davison agreed to file a Withdrawal of Claim with the United Kingdom Employment Tribunal no later than March 26, 2008. The Withdrawal of Claim was filed on March 31, 2008.

F-44 NTS COMMUNICATIONS, IN C. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED JULY 31, 2007 AND 2006 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Company NTS Communications, Inc. (NTS) and its wholly owned subsidiaries provide telecommunication services which are primarily engaged in selling or reselling long distance telephone service and providing local telephone, internet and video services to the general public, both commercial and residential. These services are mainly provided within the continental United States with a concentration in the Southwestern United States. NTS Communications, Inc. is a consolidated subsidiary of its majority-owned stockholder Telephone Electronics Corporation. Principles of consolidation The financial statements include the consolidated accounts of NTS Communications, Inc. and its four wholly-owned subsidiaries, Garey M. Wallace Company, Inc. dba GMW Company (inactive), NTS Properties, L.C., NTS Management Company, L.L.C., and NTS Construction Company. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Revenue recognition Revenues for long distance services are derived primarily from tolls charged to customers and to other long distance carriers. Deferred revenues result from billing for local service in advance. Revenues are recognized as telecommunication services are provided. Allowance for bad debts An allowance for bad debts for trade accounts receivable is computed on the reserve method and is considered adequate to absorb potential losses. Trade receivables are charged off when management believes, after considering economic conditions, business conditions and collection efforts, that the collection of the account is doubtful. Unbilled revenue Unbilled revenue represents units of service provided by the Company prior to the end of the fiscal year, but not included in accounts receivable due to the timing of routine billing cycles. Each month’s unbilled revenue is converted to accounts receivable by the end of the following month. F-45 NTS COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED JULY 31, 2007 AND 2006 (Continued) 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, Continued Inventory Inventories consist primarily of telephone equipment and are stated at cost using the first-in, first-out method. Cash equivalents For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash equivalents include all temporary cash investments with maturities of three months or less. Notes Receivable and Allowance for Note Losses Notes receivable are stated at unpaid principal balances, less an allowance, if deemed necessary, for note losses. Interest on notes is recognized over the term of the note and is calculated using the simple-interest method on principal amounts outstanding. Notes are placed on nonaccrual when management believes, after considering economic conditions, business condition, and collection efforts, that the notes are impaired or collection of interest is doubtful. Uncollectible interest previously accrued is charged off, or an allowance is established by a charge to interest income. Interest income on nonaccrual notes is recognized only to the extent cash payments are received. Property, equipment and improvements Communication systems and other property and equipment are recorded at cost. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. Betterments and improvements which substantially increase the useful lives of existing assets are capitalized. When properties are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any profit or loss is credited or charged to income. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated service lives of assets. Long-lived Assets The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment using a discounted cash flows method whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. There was no impairment charged to expense during fiscal years ended July 31, 2007 and 2006. F-46 NTS COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED JULY 31, 2007 AND 2006 (Continued) 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICES, Continued Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess cost of companies acquired over the fair value of their identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards No. 142. The fair value of goodwill is estimated annually by using the expected present value of future cash flows. There was no impairment charged to expense in 2007 and 2006. Income taxes Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax basis of depreciable assets and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end. Income taxes of future periods are calculated using current tax structure, rates, and credits which have been applied prospectively. Deferred income tax liability results primarily from the excess of tax over book depreciation and the amortization of section 197 intangibles for book over tax. Deferred tax asset results primarily from certain accrued expenses recorded per books not tax deductible until paid. Advertising costs The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred. Total advertising costs expensed in 2007 and 2006 were $313,409 and $868,313, respectively. Reclassifications Certain accounts in the prior-year financial statements have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform with the presentation in the current-year financial statements. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. F-47 NTS COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED JULY 31, 2007 AND 2006 (Continued) 2.

F-64 NTS COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Reporting cutoff date NTS Communications, Inc. (NTS) changed it reporting cutoff date from July 31 to December 31. Nature of Company NTS and its wholly owned subsidiaries provide telecommunication services which are primarily engaged in selling or reselling long distance telephone service and providing local telephone, internet and video services to the general public, both commercial and residential. These services are mainly provided within the continental United States with a concentration in the Southwestern United States. NTS Communications, Inc. is a consolidated subsidiary of its majority-owned stockholder Telephone Electronics Corporation. Principles of consolidation The financial statements include the consolidated accounts of NTS Communications, Inc. and its four wholly-owned subsidiaries, Garey M. Wallace Company, Inc. dba GMW Company (inactive), NTS Properties, L.C., NTS Management Company, L.L.C., NTS Construction Company. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Revenue recognition Revenues for long distance services are derived primarily from tolls charged to customers and to other long distance carriers. Deferred revenues result from billing for local service in advance. Revenues are recognized as telecommunication services are provided. Allowance for bad debts An allowance for bad debts for trade accounts receivable is computed on the reserve method and is considered adequate to absorb potential losses. Trade receivables are charged off when management believes, after considering economic conditions, business conditions and collection efforts, that the collection of the account is doubtful. Unbilled revenue Unbilled revenue represents units of service provided by the Company prior to the end of the fiscal year, but not included in accounts receivable due to the timing of routine billing cycles. Each month’s unbilled revenue is converted to accounts receivable by the end of the following month. F-65 NTS COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, Continued Inventory Inventories consist primarily of telephone equipment and are stated at cost using the first-in, first-out method. Cash equivalents For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash equivalents include all temporary cash investments with maturities of three months or less. Notes Receivable and Allowance for Note Losses Notes receivable are stated at unpaid principal balances, less an allowance, if deemed necessary, for note losses. Interest on notes is recognized over the term of the note and is calculated using the simple-interest method on principal amounts outstanding. Notes are placed on nonaccrual when management believes, after considering economic conditions, business condition, and collection efforts, that the notes are impaired or collection of interest is doubtful. Uncollectible interest previously accrued is charged off, or an allowance is established by a charge to interest income. Interest income on nonaccrual notes is recognized only to the extent cash payments are received. Property, equipment and improvements Communication systems and other property and equipment are recorded at cost. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. Betterments and improvements which substantially increase the useful lives of existing assets are capitalized. When properties are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any profit or loss is credited or charged to income. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated service lives of assets. Long-lived Assets The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment using a discounted cash flows method whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. There was no impairment charged to expense during the periods ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. F-66 NTS COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICES, Continued Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess cost of companies acquired over the fair value of their identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards No. 142. The fair value of goodwill is estimated annually by using the expected present value of future cash flows. There was no impairment charged to expense in 2007 and 2006. Income taxes Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax basis of depreciable assets and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end. Income taxes of future periods are calculated using current tax structure, rates, and credits which have been applied prospectively. Deferred income tax liability results primarily from the excess of tax over book depreciation and the amortization of section 197 intangibles for book over tax. Deferred tax asset results primarily from certain accrued expenses recorded per books not tax deductible until paid. Advertising costs The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred. Total advertising costs expensed in the five months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $109,704 and $136,803, respectively. Reclassifications Certain accounts in the prior-year financial statements have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform with the presentation in the current-year financial statements. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. F-67 NTS COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 2. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Acquisition of NTS Communications, Inc. (“NTS”) On February 26, 2008 (the “Closing Date”), Xfone, Inc. acquired NTS pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) entered into on August 22, 2007 with NTS, and the equity owners of NTS as sellers (the “NTS Shareholders”), as amended on February 14, 2008 and February 26, 2008. The acquisition closed on February 26, 2008. Upon closing of the acquisition, NTS and its four wholly owned subsidiaries, NTS Construction Company, Garey M. Wallace Company, Inc, NTS Telephone Company, LLC, and NTS Management Company, LLC, became wholly owned subsidiaries of Xfone, Inc. The purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $42,000,000, plus (or less) (i) the difference between NTS’ estimated working capital and the working capital target for NTS as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and (ii) the difference between amounts allocated by NTS for its fiber optic network build-out project anticipated in Texas and any indebtedness incurred by NTS in connection with this project. After applying this formula, the final aggregate purchase price was calculated as $41,900,000, and was paid by Xfone, Inc. as follows: $35,414,716 was paid in cash; and 2,366,892 shares of Xfone, Inc.'s common stock issued to certain NTS Shareholders who elected to reinvest all or a portion of their allocable sale price in the Xfone, Inc.'s Common Stock, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement.

F-73 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The information set forth in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, among others, (i) expected changes in the Company's revenues and profitability, (ii) prospective business opportunities and (iii) the Company's strategy for financing its business. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements of current condition. Some forward-looking statements may be identified by use of terms such as “believes”, “anticipates”, “intends” or “expects”. These forward-looking statements relate to the plans, objectives and expectations of the Company for future operations. Although the Company believes that its expectations with respect to the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations, in light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in all future projections, the inclusion of forward-looking statements in this Registration Statement should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives or plans of the Company will be achieved. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes attached hereto, and the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this Registration Statement. The Company's revenues and results of operations could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the risk of significant natural disaster, the inability of the Company to insure against certain risks, inflationary and deflationary conditions and cycles, currency exchange rates, changing government regulations domestically and internationally affecting our products and businesses. -53- OVERVIEW Xfone, Inc. was incorporated in Nevada, U.S.A. in September 2000. We are a holding and managing company providing international voice, video and data communications services with operations in the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel offering a wide range of services, including: local, long distance and international telephony services; video; prepaid and postpaid calling cards; cellular services; Internet services; messaging services (Email/Fax Broadcast, Email2Fax and Cyber-Number); and reselling opportunities. We serve customers worldwide. In February 2007, we moved our principal executive offices from the UK to Flowood, Mississippi, and shared executive office space with our wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, Xfone USA, Inc. The headquarters of Xfone USA recently moved from the Flowood, Mississippi location to Lubbock, Texas, to the existing headquarters of NTS Communications, Inc., which we acquired in February 2008. See “NTS Communications, Inc.” below. We intend to move our principal executive offices to the Lubbock, Texas, location in the near future as well. On October 4, 2000, we acquired Swiftnet Limited which had a business plan to provide comprehensive range of telecommunication services and products, integrated through one website. Swiftnet was incorporated in 1990 under the laws of the United Kingdom and is headquartered in London, England. Until 1999, the main revenues for Swiftnet were derived from messaging and fax broadcast services. During 2000, Swiftnet shifted its business focus to voice services and now offers a comprehensive range of calling services to resellers and end customers. Utilizing automation and proprietary software packages, Swiftnet’s strategy is to grow without the need for heavy investments and with lower expenses for operations and registration of new customers. On April 15, 2004, we established an Israel based subsidiary, Xfone Communication Ltd. (which changed its name to Xfone 018 Ltd. in March 2005). On July 4, 2004, the Ministry of Communications of the State of Israel granted Xfone 018 a license to provide international telecom services in Israel. We started providing services in Israel through Xfone 018 as of mid-December 2004. Headquartered in Petach Tikva, Israel, Xfone 018 Ltd. is a telecommunications service provider that owns and operates its own facilities-based telecommunications switching system. Xfone 018 provides residential and business customers with high quality international carrier services. On May 28, 2004, we entered into an agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire WS Telecom, Inc., a Mississippi corporation, and its two wholly owned subsidiaries, eXpeTel Communications, Inc. and Gulf Coast Utilities, Inc., through the merger of WS Telecom into our wholly owned U.S. subsidiary Xfone USA, Inc. On July 1, 2004, Xfone USA entered into a management agreement with WS Telecom which provided that Xfone USA provide management services to WS Telecom pending the consummation of the merger. The management agreement provided that all revenues generated from WS Telecom business operations would be assigned and transferred to Xfone USA. The term of the management agreement commenced on July 1, 2004, and continued until the consummation of the merger on March 10, 2005. Xfone USA, Inc. is an integrated telecommunications service provider that owns and operates its own facilities-based, telecommunications switching system and network. Xfone USA provides residential and business customers with high quality local, long distance and high-speed broadband Internet services, as well as cable television services in certain planned residential communities in Mississippi. Xfone USA is licensed to provide telecommunications services in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi. Xfone USA utilizes integrated multi-media offerings - combining digital voice, data and video services over broadband technologies to deliver services to customers throughout its service areas. On August 18, 2005, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire I-55 Internet Services, Inc., a Louisiana corporation (the “I-55 Internet Merger Agreement”). On September 13, 2005, we filed a Form 8-K discussing the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the transaction contemplated by the I-55 Internet Merger Agreement. On October 10, 2005, we entered into a First Amendment to the Merger Agreement, by and among I-55 Internet Services, Xfone, Inc, Xfone USA, Inc., our wholly-owned United States subsidiary and Hunter McAllister and Brian Acosta, key employees of I-55 Internet Services, in order to induce Xfone, Inc and Xfone USA not to terminate the I-55 Internet Merger Agreement due to the material adverse effect that Hurricane Katrina has had on the assets and business of I-55 Internet Services. As part of the amendment and since, at that time, the merger of I-55 Internet Services with and into Xfone USA had not been consummated yet, in the interim, the parties agreed and entered into on October 11, 2005 a Management Agreement (the “I-55 Internet Management Agreement”) that provided that I-55 Internet Services hired and appointed Xfone USA as manager to be responsible for the operation and management of all of I-55 Internet Services business operations, including among other things personnel, accounting, contracts, policies and budget. In consideration of the management services provided under the I-55 Internet Management Agreement, I-55 Internet Services assigned and transferred to Xfone USA all revenues generated and expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business during the term of the I-55 Internet Management Agreement. The term of the I-55 Internet Management Agreement commenced on October 11, 2005 and continued until the consummation of the merger on March 31, 2006. -54- In conjunction with the consummation of the merger and in exchange for all of the capital stock of I-55 Internet Services, we issued a total of 789,863 shares of our common stock valued at $2,380,178 and 603,939 warrants exercisable for a period of five years into shares of our common stock, with an exercise price of $3.31, valued based on the Black Scholes option-pricing model (the “Xfone Stock and Warrant Consideration”). A portion of the Xfone Stock and Warrant Consideration issued at closing was placed in an escrow account, to be held pending certain adjustments. The Company subsequently made the following two claims against such escrow account: Claim #1: The Company made a claim on March 27, 2007 to adjust the total consideration based upon the changes in customer billings as determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the First Amendment to the Merger Agreement (the “Customer Billing Adjustment Amount”), which the Company had determined was $247,965.57. Claim #2: The Company determined an undisclosed liability, in accordance with Article 6.03 of the I-55 Internet Services, Inc. Merger Agreement (as amended), in the amount of $147,550 and on November 28, 2006, sent a claim for this amount. The Shareholder Representatives of I-55 Internet Services disputed the amounts in both claims submitted and so the parties entered into negotiations on May 2, 2007, where they agreed to reduce the amount claimed in Claim #1 by $104,948.46, which represents adjustments made to the 90-Day column, Trade Accounts, and certain accounts that had previously been listed as having 90-Day balances but were subsequently confirmed as not having 90-Day balances, and by the final amount billed to EBI Comm, Inc. (“EBI”) in 2005 prior to the assets of EBI being purchased by Xfone USA, and agreed to reduce the original Loss amount claimed in Claim #2 by $6,800.00, representing additional services purchased with Zipa, Inc. under the direction of Xfone USA during the Management Agreement period from October 2005 through March 2006. Upon settlement of the claims, two Joint Deposition Notices for the escrow agent, Trustmark National Bank, were delivered to the Shareholder Representatives of I-55 Internet Services for execution, however, a Shareholder Representative refused to execute the notices pending approval of the claims by the shareholders of I-55 Internet Services. On June 7, 2007, the shareholders met and rejected the figure agreed upon with respect to Claim #1 and accepted the figure agreed upon with respect to Claim #2. There has been no further action taken by Xfone USA or us with respect to either of these claims. As a result of the rejection of the figure for Claim #1, the Company officially retracted the Joint Deposition of Escrow Claim, and consequently the original Pending Claim Notice dated March 27, 2007 in the amount of $247,965.57 is still claimed, and the revised Claim #2 in the amount of $140,750 is also claimed. Xfone USA’s new management, which was appointed following the Company’s acquisition of NTS, is reviewing this matter to determine how best to proceed in connection with the remaining pending claims against the escrow. In conjunction with that certain Letter Agreement dated October 10, 2005 with MCG Capital Corporation, a major creditor of I-55 Internet Services, and upon the consummation of the merger on March 31, 2006, we issued to MCG Capital 667,998 shares of our common stock, valued at fair value of $2,010,006, in return for retiring its loan with I-55 Internet Services . I-55 Internet Services provided Internet access and related services, such as installation of various networking equipment, website design, hosting and other Internet access installation services, throughout the Southeastern United States to individuals and businesses located predominantly in rural markets in Louisiana and Mississippi. As a result of the merger with and into Xfone USA, these services are now available in expanded markets throughout Louisiana and Mississippi. The Internet service offerings include dial-up, DSL, high speed dedicated Internet access, web services, email, the World Wide Web, Internet relay chat, file transfer protocol and Usenet news access to both residential and business customers. The I-55 Internet Services offerings provided various prices and packages that allowed I-55 Internet Services subscribers to customize their subscription with services that met customers’ particular requirements. Xfone USA now provides bundled services of voice and data (broadband Internet) to customers throughout its service areas. On August 26, 2005, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire I-55 Telecommunications, LLC, a Louisiana corporation (the “I-55 Telecom Merger Agreement”). On September 13, 2005, we filed a Form 8-K discussing the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the transaction contemplated by the I-55 Telecom Merger Agreement. In order to demonstrate our intention to continue on with the transaction contemplated by the I-55 Telecom Merger Agreement, the parties entered into on October 12, 2005 a Management Agreement (the “I-55 Telecom Management Agreement”) that provided that I-55 Telecommunications hired and appointed Xfone USA as manager to be responsible for the operation and management of all of I-55 Telecommunications’ business operations. In consideration of the management services provided under the I-55 Telecom Management Agreement, I-55 Telecommunications assigned and transferred to Xfone USA all revenues generated and expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business during the term of the I-55 Telecom Management Agreement. The term of the I-55 Telecom Management Agreement commenced on October 12, 2005 and continued until the consummation of the merger on March 31, 2006. -55- In conjunction with the consummation of the merger and in exchange for all of the capital stock of I-55 Telecommunications, LLC, we issued a total of 223,702 shares of our common stock valued at $671,687 and 79,029 warrants exercisable for a period of five years into shares of our common stock, with an exercise price of $3.38, valued based on the Black Scholes option-pricing model (the “Xfone Stock and Warrant Consideration”). A portion of the Xfone Stock and Warrant Consideration issued at closing was placed in an escrow. The Company determined a breach of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement resulting from the failure of I-55 Telecommunications to disclose the liability due and payable to the Louisiana Universal Service Fund (“LA USF”) through the period of October 2005, at which time Xfone USA undertook the management role of I-55 Telecommunications. Pursuant to Section 1(g) of the Escrow Agreement dated as of March 31, 2006 by and among Xfone USA, the Escrow Agent, and the President and Sole Member of I-55 Telecommunications, and in accordance with Article 6.02 of the Merger Agreement, Xfone USA notified the other parties that it believed that it had suffered a Loss of $30,625.52, pursuant to the provisions of Article 6.02 of the Merger Agreement dated as of August 26, 2005. Having not received any response from the President and Sole Member of I-55 Telecommunications, nor from his counsel, on October 15, 2007, and after the allotted response time allowed, Xfone USA instructed the Escrow Agent (Trustmark National Bank) to deliver from the Escrow Fund of the President and Sole Member of I-55 Telecommunications, to the Company, 7,043 shares of Common Stock and 4,838 Xfone Stock Warrants. The 7,043 shares of Common Stock and 4,838 Xfone Stock Warrants were returned to the Company for cancellation on October 31, 2007. In conjunction with certain Agreements to Purchase Promissory Notes dated October 31, 2005 / February 3, 2006 with Randall Wade James Tricou; Rene Tricou - Tricou Construction; Rene Tricou - Bon Aire Estates; Rene Tricou - Bon Aire Utility; and Danny Acosta, creditors of I-55 Telecommunications (the “Creditors”), and upon the consummation of the merger on March 31, 2006, we issued to the Creditors an aggregate of 163,933 restricted shares of common stock and an aggregate of 81,968 warrants, exercisable at $3.38 per share, at a total value of $492,220, in return for retiring their individual loans with I-55 Telecommunications. I-55 Telecommunications provided voice, data and related services throughout Louisiana and Mississippi to both individuals and businesses. Prior to the merger with and into Xfone USA, I-55 Telecommunications was a licensed facility based CLEC operating in Louisiana and Mississippi with a next generation class 5 carrier switching platform. I-55 Telecommunications provided a complete package of local and long distance services to residential and business customers across both states. As a result of the merger, Xfone USA has now expanded its On-Net (facilities) service area, through I-55 Telecommunications, into New Orleans, Louisiana and surrounding areas, including Hammond, Louisiana and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Xfone USA is expanding its sales offices to include New Orleans, in an effort to continue revenue growth and increase market share in the revitalized city, as well as into Biloxi, Mississippi, Hammond, Louisiana and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Regulations affecting the telecommunications industry began in March 2006; conversions of all circuits affected were completed in April 2006. The competition in secondary markets, such as Jackson, Mississippi, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Biloxi, Mississippi, as opposed to Tier 1 markets such as Atlanta, Georgia, is also rapidly declining due to the removal of UNE-P and the decline in the competitive local exchange providers that had been dependent on UNE-P as their only source for providing competitive local telephone services in those markets. This provides for a unique opportunity for Xfone USA to gain market share, by utilizing its existing network and to expand its facilities into these opportunity areas becoming a primary alternative to the monopoly Incumbent Local Exchange Company. On September 27, 2005, a Securities Purchase Agreement was entered for a $2,000,000 financial transaction by and among us, Xfone USA, Inc., eXpeTel Communications, Inc., Gulf Coast Utilities, Inc. and Laurus Master Fund, Ltd. The investment took the form of a convertible term note secured by our United States assets. The Term Note has a 3 year term, bears interest at a rate equal to prime plus 1.5% per annum, and is convertible, under certain conditions, into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price equal to $3.48 per share. In conjunction with the financial transaction, we issued to Laurus Master Fund 157,500 warrants which are exercisable at $3.80 per share for a period of five years. The closing of the financial transaction was on September 28, 2005. As of August 1, 2007, Laurus Master Fund, Ltd. assigned to Valens U.S. SPV I, LLC a principal amount equal to $169,925.11 of the Term Note, and to Valens Offshore Fund SPV I, Ltd. a principal amount equal to $549,289.76 of the Term Note. The conversion of the Term Note will result in dilution in the percentage of common stock owned by the company’s existing shareholders, although the conversion price was in excess of the net tangible book value per share and accordingly was not economically dilutive. -56- On September 28, 2005, a Securities Purchase Agreement was entered for a $2,212,500 financial transaction by and among us, Crestview Capital Master, LLC, Burlingame Equity Investors, LP, Burlingame Equity Investors II, LP, Burlingame Equity Investors (Offshore), Ltd., and Mercantile Discount - Provident Funds. Upon the closing of the financial transaction on October 31, 2005, we issued to the investors an aggregate of 885,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $2.50 per share together with, 221,250 warrants exercisable at $3.00 per share and 221,250 warrants exercisable at $3.25 per share. The financial transaction resulted in dilution in the percentage of common stock owned by the Company’s existing shareholders, although the price paid was in excess of the net tangible book value per share and accordingly was not economically dilutive. On November 23, 2005, a Securities Purchase Agreement was entered for a $810,000 financial transaction by and among us, Mercantile Discount-Provident Funds, Hadar Insurance Company Ltd., the Israeli Phoenix Assurance Company Ltd., and Gaon Gemel Ltd. In conjunction with the financial transaction, we issued an aggregate of 324,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $2.50 per share together with 81,000 warrants exercisable at $3.00 per share for a period of five years and 81,000 warrants exercisable at $3.25 per share for a period of five years. The financial transaction was closed on April 6, 2006. The financial transaction resulted in dilution in the percentage of common stock owned by the Company’s existing shareholders, although the price paid was in excess of the net tangible book value per share and accordingly was not economically dilutive. On January 1, 2006, Xfone USA, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an Agreement with EBI Comm, Inc. (“EBI”), a privately held Internet Service Provider, to purchase the assets of EBI. EBI provided a full range of Internet access options for both commercial and residential customers in north Mississippi. Based in Columbus, Mississippi, EBI’s services included Dial-up, DSL, T1 Dedicated Access and Web Hosting. The customer base, numbering approximately 1,500 Internet users, is largely concentrated in the Golden Triangle area, which includes Columbus, West Point and Starkville, Mississippi. The acquisition was structured as an asset purchase, providing for Xfone USA to pay EBI total consideration equal to 50% of the monthly collected revenue from the customer base during the first 12 months, beginning January 2006. Acquired assets include the customer base and customer lists, trademarks and all related intellectual property, fixed assets and all account receivables. As a result of further negotiations between us and EBI, we have agreed to pay the total consideration of this acquisition in cash in the amount of $85,699 in monthly payments of $10,000 until paid in full, and we made the first of such payments on June 1, 2007 and final payment on January 25, 2008. The acquisition was not significant from an accounting perspective. On January 10, 2006 (effective as of January 1, 2006), Xfone USA, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Canufly.net, Inc. (“Canufly.net”), an Internet Service Provider based in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and its principal shareholder, Mr. Michael Nassour. Canufly.net provided residential and business customers with high-speed Internet services and utilized the facilities-based network of Xfone USA, as an alternative to BellSouth, to provide Internet connectivity to its customers. Canufly.net also provided Internet services through a small wireless application in certain areas in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The transaction was closed on January 24, 2006. We agreed to pay a total purchase price of up to $710,633, payable as follows: (i) $185,000 in cash payable in twelve equal monthly payments, the first installment was paid at closing, and as of December 31, 2006, the entire amount was paid in full and in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement; (ii) $255,633 in cash, paid at closing, to pay off the loan with the B&K Bank; (iii) 33,768 restricted shares of common stock and 24,053 warrants exercisable at $2.98 per share for a period of five years were issued to the shareholders of Canufly.net during May 2006.

Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, we increased our ownership interest in Story Telecom from 39.2% to 69.6% in a cash transaction valued at $1,200,000. $900,000 of the total consideration was applied to payables owed by Story Telecom to us and our subsidiary Swiftnet Limited for back-end telecommunications services. The balance of $300,000 was paid to Story Telecom to be used as working capital. Story Telecom, Inc., a telecommunication service provider, operated in the United Kingdom through its two wholly owned subsidiaries, Story Telecom Limited and Story Telecom (Ireland) Limited (which was dissolved on February 23, 2007). Following the acquisition, Story Telecom operates as a division of our operations in the United Kingdom. The stock purchase pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement was completed on May 16, 2006. The transaction contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement was not significant from an accounting perspective. On March 25, 2008, in connection with a settlement of a legal proceeding before the UK Employment Tribunal initiated by Mr. Nir Davison, we purchased from Mr. Davison and Trecastle Holdings Limited, the shares of common stock of Story Telecom, Inc. that each party owned, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of £270,000 ($539,662), pursuant to the terms of a Compromise Agreement and a Securities Purchase Agreement entered into between the parties on that date. Upon acquisition of the shares of common stock of Story Telecom, Inc. from Mr. Davison and Trecastle Holdings, Story Telecom, Inc. became our wholly owned subsidiary. On May 25, 2006, we and the shareholders of Equitalk.co.uk Limited, a privately held telephone company based in the United Kingdom (“Equitalk”) entered into an Agreement relating to the sale and purchase of Equitalk (the “Equitalk Agreement”). The Equitalk Agreement provided for us to acquire Equitalk in a restricted common stock and warrant transaction valued at $1,650,000.

On August 15, 2007, the Company, Swiftnet Limited, our wholly owned U.K.-based subsidiary (“Swiftnet”), and Dan Kirschner entered into a definitive Share Purchase Agreement to be completed on the same date, pursuant to which Swiftnet purchased from Mr. Kirschner the 67.5% equity interest in Auracall Limited (“Auracall”) that he beneficially owned, thereby increasing Swiftnet’s ownership interest in Auracall from 32.5% to 100%. Swiftnet had acquired the 32.5% interest in Auracall through several transactions that occurred since October 16, 2001. The purchase price for the shares was £810,917.64 (approximately $1,616,158), payable as follows: £500,000 (approximately $996,500) was paid in cash upon signing of the Share Purchase Agreement, and the remaining £304,000, plus interest of £6,917.64 (approximately $619,658), was payable in monthly installments beginning in September 2007 and continued through March 2008.

The Bonds are issued for an amount equal to their par value. A summary of the main terms of the Bonds follows: The Bonds will pay annual interest at a rate of 9% that will be paid semi-annually on the 1 st of June and on the 1st of December of every year from 2008 until 2015 (inclusive). The principal of the Bonds will be repaid in eight equal annual payments on the 1 st of December of every year from 2008 until 2015 (inclusive). The principal and interest of the Bonds is linked to the Israeli Consumer Price Index (“CPI”). Within the framework of the conditions of the Bonds' offering, the Company has committed, among other things, as follows: 1. To make an effort and to take all actions that are reasonably required, subject to the law and the rules of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Ltd. (the “TASE”), to list the Bonds for trading on the TASE, such that restrictions on resale will not apply in accordance with Section 15c of the Israeli Securities Law 5728-1968 (the “Israeli Securities Law”) on the holders of the Bonds, no later than 12 months from the Date of Issuance. 2. Immediately after the issuance the Company will apply to the TASE to list the Bonds as a “non-tradable security” with the TASE Clearing House, at the discretion of the Company, subject to the law and the rules of the TASE. 3. Starting from the date of the Bonds’ listing for trade on the TASE, to the extent such listing occurs, the interest rate payable for the unpaid balance of the Bonds will be reduced by 1% (to an annual interest rate of 8%). 4. Until the Bonds are listed for trade on the TASE, in the event that the rating of the Bonds is reduced from the rating given them at their issuance - A3 by Midroog - to Baa1 (or an equivalent rating by another rating company), the annual rate of interest on the Bonds will increase by 0.25%. 5. If the Bonds are not listed for trading within 12 months from the Date of Issuance, any holder of the Bonds will be allowed (but not required), to redeem his Bonds, in whole or in part, in an early redemption. 6.

The interest from the proceeds of the offering that have accumulated in the trust account will be transferred to the Company. The applicable conditions are: (i) that the Company raises an aggregate of at least $20.0 million in equity financings (this condition has been satisfied subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals); and (ii) that the conditions (which are not related to the financing of the acquisition) for the consummation of the NTS Acquisition have been met. 7.

Each of the institutional investors represented that it is an institutional investor classified as a type of investor listed in the first supplement to the Israeli Securities Law, for the purposes of Section 15a(b)(1) of the Israeli Securities Law; that its offer was for itself and/or for customers that are investors listed in Section 5a(b)(1) of the Israeli Securities Law, respectively.

Each of the institutional investors has declared and confirmed that the Bonds, Warrants and shares that may result from the exercise of the Warrants, are not acquired for the purpose of “distribution” (as this term is defined in the US securities laws) in the U.S. According to an agreement entered into as of December 12, 2007, between the Company and Excellence Nessuah (1993) Ltd. (“Excellence Underwriters”) and First International & Co. - Underwriting and Investments Ltd. (“First International Underwriters”) (the "December 12, 2007 Agreement"), Excellence Underwriters and First International Underwriters undertook to serve as the pricing underwriters for the prospectus to be filed with the Israeli Securities Authority and the TASE for the listing for trade of the Bonds on the TASE (“Commitment to Serve as a Pricing Underwriter”). The Commitment to Serve as a Pricing Underwriter is subject to the fulfillment of the requirements of the Israeli Securities Law in connection with the prospectus, that every irregularity found during the due diligence, if any, will be corrected, and that the Company and said underwriters will enter into a customary underwriting agreement. In connection with Excellence Underwriters and First International Underwriters Commitment to Serve as a Pricing Underwriter and the services rendered by them to the Company in connection with the Bonds offering, the Company agreed to pay Excellence Underwriters and First International Underwriters a fee equal to 3% of the proceeds of the offering, 1% to be paid upon the receipt of the proceeds of the offering by the Trustee, and the additional 2% to be paid upon the release to the Company of the proceeds of the offering by the Trustee.

Under the terms of the offering, each investor has to pay the Company an amount equal to the par value of the Bonds purchased by it. -61- Recent Developments On August 22, 2007, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “NTS Purchase Agreement”) with NTS Communications, Inc. (“NTS”), a provider of integrated voice, data and video solutions headquartered in Lubbock, Texas, and the owners of approximately 85% of the equity interests in NTS, to acquire NTS. Subsequently, all of the remaining shareholders of NTS executed the Agreement, bringing the total percentage of equity interests in NTS owned by NTS shareholders that entered into the Agreement (the “NTS Sellers”) to 100%. On February 14, 2008, we entered into a First Amendment to the NTS Purchase Agreement to amend the agreement to further extend the expiration date for the closing of our acquisition of NTS. On February 26, 2008, we entered into a Second Amendment to the NTS Purchase Agreement which amended, among other things, the definition and elements of working capital, as such term is defined in the NTS Purchase Agreement, and increased the escrow amount. The acquisition closed on February 26, 2008. Upon closing of the acquisition, NTS and its six wholly owned subsidiaries, NTS Construction Company, Garey M. Wallace Company, Inc., Midcom of Arizona, Inc., Communications Brokers, Inc., NTS Telephone Company, LLC, and NTS Management Company, LLC, became our wholly owned subsidiaries. The purchase price for the acquisition set forth in the NTS Purchase Agreement was approximately $42,000,000 (excluding acquisition related costs), plus (or less) (i) the difference between NTS’ estimated working capital and the working capital target for NTS as set forth in the NTS Purchase Agreement, and (ii) the difference between amounts allocated by NTS for its fiber optic network build-out project anticipated in Texas and any indebtedness incurred by NTS in connection with this project, each of which was subject to our advance written approval. After applying this formula, the final aggregate purchase price was calculated as $41,900,000, and was paid as follows: o $35,414,715 was paid in cash; and o 2,366,892 shares of our common stock were issued to certain NTS Sellers who elected to reinvest all or a portion of their allocable sale price in our Common Stock, pursuant to the terms of the NTS Purchase Agreement. Our Board of Directors determined, in accordance with the NTS Purchase Agreement, the number of shares of our Common Stock to be delivered to each participating NTS Seller by dividing the portion of such NTS Seller’s allocable sale price that the NTS Seller elected to receive in shares of our Common Stock by 93% of the average closing price of our Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange for the ten consecutive trading days preceding the trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date (i.e., $2.74). The aggregate sales price reinvested by all such NTS Sellers was $6,485,285. On February 26, 2008, and in connection with the closing of the acquisition, the parties entered into the following material definitive agreements: A. Free Cash Flow Participation Agreement. The Company entered into a Free Cash Flow Participation Agreement (the “Participation Agreement”) with NTS Holdings, ”), an entity owned by Barbara Baldwin, NTS’ President and CEO, Jerry Hoover, NTS’ Executive Vice President – Chief Financial Officer, and Brad Worthington, NTS’ Executive Vice President – Chief Operating Officer, pursuant to which NTS Holdings will be entitled to a payment from the Company of an amount equal to 5% of the aggregate excess free cash flow generated by the Company’s U.S. Operations, which is defined in the Participation Agreement as the operations of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries, which include Xfone USA, Inc. and NTS, and their respective subsidiaries, as well as any U.S. entity that the Company acquires directly, or indirectly through its subsidiaries in the future (a “Future Acquisition”). NTS Holdings will be entitled to the participation amount beginning at such time as the Company has received a full return of its initial invested capital, plus an additional 8% return per year, in connection with the NTS acquisition (as well as in connection with any Future Acquisition). The Participation Agreement will remain in effect in perpetuity, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms. Termination of the Participation Agreement may occur upon a sale or buyout of the Company’s U.S. Operations, at the option of the purchaser in any such transaction, and in the limited circumstances set forth in the Participation Agreement. -62- B. Escrow Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company and certain representatives of the NTS Shareholders (the “NTS Shareholder Representatives”) entered into an Escrow Agreement with Trustmark National Bank, as escrow agent, pursuant to which the Company deposited an amount of cash and shares of Common Stock equal to $6,679,999 (15.9%) of the aggregate purchase price for the acquisition, to be held and administered by the escrow agent in order to secure certain obligations of the sellers under the Purchase Agreement. Each share of Common Stock deposited with the escrow agent has an agreed value of $2.74, which was determined by using the average per share closing price of the Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive trading days preceding the trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date. C. Release. Concurrently with the execution of the agreements described above, each of Barbara Baldwin, Jerry Hoover and Brad Worthington executed a Release, releasing NTS, the Company and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees and their successors and assigns, from any and all claims, causes or rights of action, demands and damages related to the business, affairs, actions or omissions of NTS and those of its officers, directors, employees or independent contractors through the Closing Date, as well as from any amounts due from NTS to the Officer for serving NTS in any capacity through the Closing Date. D. In addition, the Company entered into a Noncompetition, Nondisclosure and Nonsolicitation Agreement with Telephone Electronics Corporation, the largest NTS shareholder prior to the closing; and NTS entered into employment agreements with Barbara Baldwin, Jerry Hoover and Brad Worthington. In connection with the closing of the acquisition on February 26, 2008, the Company issued 2,366,892 shares of the Company’s Common Stock to certain NTS Shareholders who elected to reinvest all or a portion of their allocable sale price in the Company’s Common Stock, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The Company’s Board of Directors determined, in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock to be delivered to each participating NTS Shareholder by dividing the portion of such NTS Shareholder’s allocable sale price that the NTS Shareholder elected to receive in shares of the Company’s Common Stock by 93% of the average closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange for the ten consecutive trading days preceding the trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date (i.e., $2.74). The aggregate sales price reinvested by all such NTS Shareholders was $6,485,285. The offering of the shares of Common Stock to the NTS Shareholders was not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the NTS Shareholders do not have any registration rights with respect to the shares they received pursuant to this offering. On March 5, 2008, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the “March 5, 2008 Agreement”) with Oberon Securities, LLC, a New York City-based registered broker-dealer (“Oberon Securities”), pursuant to which the Company will pay Oberon Securities $1,200,000 in cash for its services to the Company as financial advisor in connection with the Company's acquisition of NTS, payable as follows: (i) $400,000 no later than March 7, 2008 (ii) $400,000 no later than May 1, 2008 and (iii) $400,000 no later than July 1, 2008. The March 5, 2008 Agreement sets forth the total and final fees due to Oberon Securities for its services in connection with the NTS acquisition, pursuant to the Company’s prior agreements with Oberon Securities and its affiliates. On March 17, 2008, Xfone 018 entered into an Agreement of Principles with Tiv Taam Holdings 1 Ltd., an Israeli public company (“Tiv Taam”), pursuant to which Xfone 018 agreed to purchase from Tiv Taam, and Tiv Taam agreed to sell to Xfone 018, approximately 89% of the outstanding share capital (approximately 69% of its fully diluted share capital) of Robomatix Technologies Ltd. (“Robomatix”) which Tiv Taam currently owns. Robomatix owns approximately 90% of the issued share capital of Tadiran Telecom-Communication Services In Israel Ltd. (“Tadiran Telecom”), which is the general partner of Tadiran Telecom-Communication Services In Israel – Limited Partnership (“Tadiran Telecom LP”), an Israeli entity dealing with the distribution, maintenance, assistance services and sale of switchboards for the business community in Israel. Accordingly, upon consummation of the acquisition, Xfone 018 will also acquire control over Tadiran Telecom and Tadiron Telecom LP. The purchase price for the acquisition is NIS 44,000,000 (approximately $12,503,552), subject to adjustment as set forth in the agreement, payable in three installments, as follows: o On the closing date, NIS 15,500,000 (approximately $4,404,660) (the “First Installment”); o By November 20, 2008, NIS 15,500,000 (approximately $4,404,660), subject to adjustment resulting from linkage to the Consumer Price Index (the “Second Installment”); and o By November 1, 2009, NIS 13,000,000 (approximately $3,694,231), subject to adjustment resulting from linkage to the Consumer Price Index (the “Third Installment”).

In the event that the necessary approvals are not received within 120 days of the date of execution of the Agreement, or a reserved approval was received or an approval under conditions which make it burdensome on Xfone 018 or significantly prejudice the profitability of the transaction for Xfone 018, the Agreement will be null and void as if it was never executed. -63- RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 U.K. Operations - 2007 Our U.K. subsidiary, Swiftnet Limited operates switching and computer systems offering a range of innovative, in-house developed telecommunications services. Swiftnet's strategy is to grow without the need for heavy investments and with lower operational expenses through the use of automation. A comprehensive range of telecommunication services and products are sold directly to end-users, through a web site integrating all of Swiftnet's services. The services are mainly telephone related services to customers dialing local and international destinations. Swiftnet provides value added services such as fax broadcast, email to fax and various other messaging services. Swiftnet also provides services for a range of resellers and partners to sell to their customers. These resellers and partners include Auracall Limited, Story Telecom Limited and Equitalk.co.uk Limited. Swiftnet's telecommunications services are used by subscribers in the U.K. and worldwide. Our U.K. subsidiary, Equitalk.co.uk Limited is an automated e-telco providing post-paid, telecommunications services to customers across the whole of the U.K. These customers are typically making calls within the UK. Equitalk’s strategy is to grow through acquiring customers directly through sales and marketing activities. Our U.K. subsidiary, Story Telecom Limited provides international calling services through calling cards and special access numbers available for use from mobile phones and landlines. Story Telecom's strategy is to grow through adding products and services targeted at customers making international calls. In 2007, we had only approximately 0.2% of the market share of the United Kingdom telecommunication market (not including mobiles revenues), based on our revenues of $24 million during 2007, compared with the approximately $10 billion telecommunication market (not including mobiles revenues) in the United Kingdom,. We had four major types of customers in the U.K.: Residential, Commercial, Governmental agencies and Resellers. In 2007 our largest non-affiliated reseller was WorldNet Global Communications Ltd. which generated under 1% of our total revenues. We provide WorldNet Global Communications with the billing system. We anticipate that WorldNet will continue to contribute approximately the same amount of UKP to our revenues in year 2008. However, should our agreements involving WorldNet be cancelled, our revenues will be negatively affected. In 2007, approximately 54.3% of our revenues were derived from our operations in the United Kingdom. -64- U.S. Operations - 2007 Our sole U.S. subsidiary during 2007, Xfone USA, Inc. provides voice, data and related services throughout Louisiana and Mississippi to both individuals and businesses. Xfone USA is a licensed facility based CLEC operating in Louisiana and Mississippi with a next generation class 5-carrier switching platform. Xfone USA offers a complete package of local and long distance services to residential and business customers across both states. In 2007 we had approximately 11,000 End-User Switched Access telephone lines in the Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi market through the combination of Xfone USA and I-55 Telecommunications, LLC or approximately 0.2% of market share. This total market size in 2007 represented 5,732,998 telephone lines, with BellSouth Telecommunications maintaining its monopoly market share with 4,949,629 telephone lines or approximately 86% of the market. All CLECs combined made up the remaining 783,369 telephone lines or approximately 14% of the tri-state market, according to the 2007 FCC Report - Trends in Local Telephone Competition. In 2007, approximately 27.5% of our revenues were derived from our operations in the United States. With continued cross selling to Xfone USA Customers as well as projected expansion into specific targeted wire centers, we expect to continue revenue growth and increase market share. Regulations affecting the telecommunications industry began in March 2006; conversions of all circuits affected were completed in April 2006. The competition in rural markets is also rapidly declining due to the removal of UNE-P and the decline in the competitive local exchange providers that had been dependent on UNE-P as their only source for providing competitive local telephone services in those communities. We believe that this provides for a unique opportunity for Xfone USA to continue to gain market share, by utilizing its existing network and to expand it facilities into these areas becoming a primary alternative to the monopoly Incumbent Local Exchange Company. The overall trend for 2007 continued to show improving wire line margins in the Business markets and maintaining margins in the Residential (Consumer) markets for facilities based providers. Mergers and acquisitions continued throughout 2007, as a component for offsetting the line loss felt throughout the CLEC industry due to the regulatory changes. The industry will see continued merger and acquisition activity in 2008 and beyond for companies that have cash and public equity resources. These transactions will continue to change the landscape in the telecommunications industry. Analysts still believe there will be more consolidation opportunity over the next two to three years in both wire line and wireless markets. As a result of regulatory changes, the competitive landscape continues to change, creating additional opportunity for facilities based competitive carriers to gain a larger market share in a shorter period of time in certain geographic markets, through internal growth (sales) and external growth (mergers and acquisitions) due to the continued departure of non-faculties based providers through either termination of their business or through acquisitions. Demands in the market show continued interest in providing Telco TV, VOIP products and rapid growth in the Broadband market, heating up competition with the Regional Bell Carriers and cable providers. DSL services should continue to grow due to aggressive pricing with higher speeds becoming the norm delivering download speeds of 6 Meg in certain areas. Xfone USA’s business plan for 2007 continues to include expansion of market share in both Business and Residential markets with focus in its specific geographic service areas primarily in Mississippi and Louisiana, and in those markets where the company has deployed its own network and Central Offices (CO’s), which are the highest margin areas. The Business markets will continue to be expanded through Direct Sales and Independent sales efforts, while the Residential markets will be expanded through radio, direct mail, email marketing and other low cost advertising and message delivery opportunities. In May 2007, Xfone USA hired a Vice President of Business Sales and incorporated an aggressive business sales expansion plan focusing this effort in its specific geographic and high margin service areas in Jackson, Mississippi, Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana. The expansion effort is on plan from the projections submitted in May 2007. The Company’s business plan in 2007 also included growth through acquisitions, which made sense for several reasons: (i) faster results in achieving large top line revenue performance; (ii) significant synergies impact from consolidating corporate functions; and (iii) relatively easy integration of acquired companies because of facilities and network architecture. Xfone USA is also planning for the future and emergence of the “Third Network” and has scale and availability to implement VoIP, Telco TV, WiFi and WiMax network architecture, as they become more viable into the future. However, these deployments are currently under much scrutiny and are being implemented in larger metropolitan areas such as New York City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Xfone USA, a facilities based fully integrated communications carrier, is positioned in 2008 to continue to take full advantage of the regulatory opportunities afforded to facilities-based providers as a result of the FCC TRRO ruling in 2005, as well as to take advantage of the consolidation momentum started in 2006. -65- Israeli Operations - 2007 Since the opening of the international telephony market in Israel to competition in 1996, and until 2004, only three companies have provided international telephony services in Israel. The market, estimated at that time to be 2 billion minutes per year, was more or less equally divided between the three companies. On July 4, 2004, the Ministry of Communications of the State of Israel granted our subsidiary, Xfone 018 a license to provide international telecom services in Israel. We started providing services in Israel through Xfone 018 as of mid-December 2004. In 2004, two other new providers of international telephony services launched their services. The international telephony market is highly competitive and therefore all six providers had to offer low prices in order to attract or retain subscribers and call minutes. During 2006, two significant mergers occurred in the Israeli international telephony market, leaving only four companies in the competition. The aforementioned mergers enabled Xfone 018 to execute, as of December 2006, a new business strategy, according to which it re-priced its services by distinguishing the rates for its subscribed customers from the rates for its non-subscribed customers. The new strategy has proved to be successful, and in 2007 Xfone 018 revenues were significantly increased. In 2007, the Israeli international telephony market was estimated to be 2.9 billion minutes. We estimate our market share as of December 31, 2007, as approximately 5.5% of the Israeli market. We have two major types of customers in Israel: Residential and Commercial. In 2007, approximately 18.2% of our revenues were derived from our operations in Israel. Xfone 018 is operating with significantly lower overhead than its three competitors in the Israeli market by utilizing and building on our previous business models. We therefore believe that Xfone 018 will increase its market share in the international communication market, will generate a greater part of our revenues and will have a major contribution to our expected growth. Our primary geographic markets are the United Kingdom, the United States and Israel. However, we serve customers worldwide. Comparison Financial Information Years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 - Percentage of Revenues: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Revenues 100 % 100 % Cost of Revenues -44 % -58 % Gross Profit 56 % 42 % Operating Expenses: Research and Development 0 % 0 % Marketing and Selling -24 % -13 % General and Administrative -28 % -26 % Non- recurring loss -6 % 0 % Total Operating Expenses 58 % -39 % Income (loss) before Taxes -4 % 2 % Net Income -3 % 2 % -66- COMPARISON OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006 Revenues. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 18% to $44,723,934 from $37,914,037 for the same period in 2006. The increase in our revenues is primarily attributable to the operation of Xfone UK and Xfone 018. During 2007, the revenues of Xfone UK increased 43% to $24,263,610 from $16,951,119 for the same period in 2006. The increase in revenues in the U.K. is mainly a result of increased marketing activity and on-going product improvements. Despite the sharp increase in the revenues in the UK, Xfone UK suffered a slow down during the fourth quarter due to a change in the tariff structure by one of the local mobile operators. During the fourth quarter, Xfone UK suffered a decrease in sales attributable to a change in the tariff structure by a local mobile operator. A high proportion of Xfone UK's customers have mobile phones from this operator and use Xfone's services by dialing an Xfone access number from their mobile phone. During the fourth quarter, the mobile operator changed the pricing on the access numbers, so that they were no longer cost effective for customers to dial. This change affected not only Xfone, but all alternative suppliers of international calls in the UK. Xfone UK undertook a marketing campaign to promote its other services to these customers, to allow them to connect via alternative, low cost access numbers. This has been successful in terms of migrating customers, and the number of minutes switches by the company is growing well. However, these alternative products generate a lower level of sales and margin per minute than the original products . During 2007, revenues of Xfone 018 increased by 49% to $8,169,433 from $5,488,712 for the same period in 2006. The increase in revenues of Xfone 018 is mainly a result of a new business strategy, according to which it re-priced its services by distinguishing the rates for its subscribed customers from the rates for its non-subscribed customers, expanding its customer base, and introducing a new product to the market. During 2007, the revenues of Xfone USA decreased 21% to $12,290,891 from $15,474,206 for the same period in 2006. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to the attrition of dialup internet customers and longer than expected commissioning process until revenues is earned. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues consists primarily of traffic time purchased from telephony companies and other related charges. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, decreased 10.7% to $19,626,322 from $21,968,998 for the same period in 2006. The decrease in our cost of revenues is primarily attributed to the operations in the UK and Israel. The results of operations of Equitalk and Story Telecom in the UK were consolidated for the full period of 2007 for the first time, and as a result, contributed to the high gross margin in the UK. Commencing August 15, 2007, Auracall's results of operations were consolidated for the first time and contributed high margin to our UK operations. High gross marging contributed by Xfone 018 resulted from the change in the business strategy from the end of 2006. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to approximately 44% in 2007, from approximately 58% in 2006. As a result of ongoing product improvements, an increase in the sales of higher margin services and strategic change in our pricing policy to segregate between registered and unregistered users in Israel, we achieved a decreased in cost of revenues as percentage of revenues in all our geographic markets, and primarily in the U.K. and Israel where cost of revenues as percentage of revenues decrease to 41.4% and 37%, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 69.8% and 44.6%, respectively, in the same period in 2006. GENERAL ANALYSIS -67- Research and Development . Research and development expenses were $47,609 for the year ended December 31, 2007, which is consistent with our research and development costs of $45,709 during the year ended December 31, 2006. Research and development expenses consist of labor costs of our research and development manager and other related costs. We estimate that research and development expenses will remain in the same level in 2008. Marketing and Selling Expenses. Marketing and selling expenses consist primarily of commissions to agents and resellers. Other marketing and selling expenses are related to compensation attributed to employees engaged in marketing and selling activities, promotion, advertising and related expenses. Marketing and selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased 121% to $10,886,883 from $4,937,007 for the same period in 2006. The increase in the marketing and selling expenses is primarily attributed to our operations in the U.K and Israel. Approximately $5,250,000 of the increase is attributed to agents' commission payable by Swiftnet, $5,075,000 of which was payable to Auracall Limited, in the period before Auracall became a wholly owned subsidiary. Approximately $725,000 of the increase is attributed to the selling and marketing activities of Story Telecom which was consolidated for the first time during the second quarter of 2006, and Equitalk which was consolidated in our financial statements during July 2006. Approximately $500,000 of the marketing and selling expenses is attributed to the launch of marketing campaign in Israel. Marketing and selling expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 24% for the year ended December 31, 2007 from 13.2% for the same period in 2006. General and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased 25% to $12,335,759 from $9,927,301 for the same period in 2006. This increase is mainly due to increase in payroll expenses in the U.K., U.S. and Israel. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs for administration, finance and general management personnel and consulting fees. Non- recurring Loss. On March 19, 2008, the UK court handed down judgment in the dispute between Swiftnet and MCI and awarded £1,278,942 ($2,564,036) plus legal costs and interest in favour of MCI. The Company's financial statements have carried the full amount Swiftnet calculated that it owed to MCI based on the data held in Swiftnet’s billing systems. The net effect of this judgement including estimation of the Company's legal fees, MCI’s legal costs and interest payable is approximately £1,427,737 ($2,856,803) which is presented as a non-recurring loss in the Statement Of Operations. Swiftnet is in the process of taking legal advice as to whether it will seek an appeal to the English Court of Appeal. Financing Expenses. Financing expenses, net, for the year ended December 31, 2007, decreased 5% to $515,562 from $540,668 for the same period in 2006. This decrease is mainly due to the repayment of interest bearing loans and balances in the US and Israel. Net Income (Loss). Net Loss for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,283,892 compared with a net income $660,696 for the same period in 2006. This is primarily due to the non recurring loss and decrease in the U.K. Earning (Loss) Per Share. Diluted net loss per share of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $0.109 compared to diluted net profit of 0.065 for the same period in 2006. -68- BALANCE SHEET Comparison of the balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 Current Assets . Current assets amounted to $41,269,446 as of December 31, 2007, as compared with $10,291,475 as of December 31, 2006. The increase in the current assets is mainly attributable to the increase in cash in the amount of $4,617,216 provided mainly by operating expenses, an increase in restricted cash in the amount of $25,562,032 provided by issuance of debentures, and accrued expenses incurred in connection with the debentures issuance and with the judgment handed down against Swiftnet in its dispute with MCI.

We agreed to indemnify Abraham Keinan and/or Guy Nissenson on account of any damage and/or loss and/or expense (including legal expenses) that they may incur in connection with the stock pledge and/or any other obligation made by them to Bank Hapoalim in connection with the collateral; (f) We and Swiftnet Limited issued a Letter of Guarantee, unlimited in amount, in favor of the bank, guaranteeing all debt and indebtedness of Xfone 018 towards the bank; (g) subordination of the Minority Partner Loan (as defined below). As of December 31, 2007, we have a balance due of 2,365,447 NIS ($615,041) under the credit facility. -70- According to an agreement between us, Xfone 018 Ltd. and our 26% minority interest partner in Xfone 018 (the “Minority Partner”), the Minority Partner provided in 2004 a bank guarantee of 10,000,000 NIS ($2,600,104) to the Ministry of Communications of the State of Israel which replaced an existing bank guarantee given by the Company in connection with Xfone 018’s license to provide international telecom services in Israel. As part of the agreement, the Company agreed to indemnify the Minority Partner for any damage caused to him due to the forfeiture of the bank guarantee with the Ministry of Communications on account of any act and/or omission of Xfone 018, provided that the said act or omission is performed against the opinion of the Minority Partner or without his knowledge. According to the above-mentioned agreement with the Minority Partner, the Minority Partner provided in the fourth quarter of 2004, a shareholder loan of approximately $400,000 to Xfone 018 (the “Minority Partner Loan”). The Minority Partner Loan is payable after four years with annual interest of 4% and linkage to the Israeli consumer price index. As of December 31, 2007, the balance of the Minority Partner Loan is 1,891,293 NIS ($491,756). As of December 31, 2007, we provided to Xfone 018 a shareholder loan in an aggregate amount of $1,250,394. As of December 31, 2007, our Israeli subsidiary activities were financed by the shareholders loans and by using 2,365,447 NIS ($615,041) of the credit facility from Bank Hapoalim. On September 27, 2005, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement for a $2,000,000 financial transaction with Xfone USA, Inc., eXpeTel Communications, Inc., Gulf Coast Utilities, Inc. and Laurus Master Fund, Ltd. The investment, which took the form of a convertible term note secured by our United States assets, has a 3 year term and bears interest at a rate equal to prime plus 1.5% per annum. The Term Note is convertible, under certain conditions, into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price equal to $3.48 per share. In conjunction with the financial transaction, we issued to Laurus Master Fund 157,500 warrants which are exercisable at $3.80 per share for a period of five years. The closing of the financing was on September 28, 2005. As of August 1, 2007, Laurus Master Fund, Ltd. assigned to Valens U.S. SPV I, LLC a principal amount equal to $169,925.11 of the Term Note, and to Valens Offshore Fund SPV I, Ltd. a principal amount equal to $549,289.76 of the Term Note. Net proceeds from the financing were mainly used for procurement of capital equipment and general working capital purposes for us and Xfone USA, eXpeTel Communications and Gulf Coast Utilities, Inc. The conversion of the Term Note will result in dilution in the percentage of common stock owned by our existing shareholders, although the conversion price was in excess of the net tangible book value per share and accordingly was not economically dilutive. The potential or actual resale of the shares underlying the note could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. The balance as of December 31, 2007 due to Laurus Master Fund is $623,643. On September 27, 2006, a Shareholders Loan Agreement was entered by and between Auracall Limited, at that time an affiliated entity and currently a wholly owned subsidiary, Swiftnet Limited, a wholly owned U.K. subsidiary and the former Managing Director of Auracall who held 67.5% of Auracall. As part of this agreement, Swiftnet agreed to provide a loan of £24,000 ($48,115) to Auracall, free of interest, to be repaid within one year. The loan was funded on October 13, 2006, and repaid by Auracall in full on May 10, 2007.

The total amount proposed to be raised in the Proposed Public Offering was approximately $12 million. The Proposed Public Offering was subject to the approval of the ISA and the TASE, as well as the execution of an underwriting agreement and final pricing. On November 9, 2006 we were informed that the TASE decided to seek a No-Action Letter from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “No-Action Letter”) and that until the No-Action Letter is granted to the TASE the Proposed Public Offering is delayed. On May 7, 2007, we were informed by the TASE that the No-Action Letter had not yet been granted.

The financial transaction was closed on February 8, 2007. The net proceeds of the financial transaction were $853,649, and are being used for general working capital and/or investment in equipment and/or acquisition and/or business development. The financial transaction resulted in dilution in the percentage of common stock owned by our existing shareholders, although the price paid was in excess of the net tangible book value per share and accordingly was not economically dilutive. Our subsidiary, Xfone USA, Inc. was receiving services from Embarq Logistics, Inc. ("Embarq") related to the installation of certain collocation facilities in Mississippi. Certain disputes arose between the parties as to the scope of the work, the manner in which it was carried out and the timeliness of completion, and the parties agreed that Xfone USA had accrued an aggregate of $830,000 in liabilities to Embarq in connection with the services Embarq provided. On May 31, 2007, the parties reached a settlement agreement, pursuant to which Xfone USA paid Embarq $415,004 upon execution of the agreement, and issued a promissory note for the remaining balance of $414,996, which is payable in six consecutive monthly installments of $69,166 each, beginning on June 30, 2007 through November 30, 2007.

In addition, Story Telecom has the right to set-off repayments under the loan against sums due to us by Story Telecom. The loan is pre-payable at any time upon 30 days’ notice. On July 18, 2007 and on September 25, 2007, we borrowed £350,000 ($701,684) and £50,000 ($100,241), respectively, of the loan.

On December 13, 2007, the Company accepted offers, for the issuance of securities to Israeli institutional investors, for total gross proceeds of NIS 100,382,100 (approximately $25,562,032) par value bonds (Series A) (the “Bonds”). The Bonds were issued for an amount equal to their par value. A summary of the main terms of the Bonds is described above under "Overview". IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS Effective January 1, 2007, we changed our functional and reporting currency from the Great Britain Pounds ("GBP") to the U.S. dollar for the reason that the majority of our transactions and balances are denominated in U.S. dollars. Consistent with SFAS No. 52 “Foreign Currency Translation,” the change in functional currency will be accounted for prospectively; therefore, there is no effect on our historical consolidated financial statements. The translated amounts for non-monetary assets at December 31, 2006 became the accounting basis for those assets as of January 1, 2007. 54.3% and 18.2% of our revenues in the 2007 were derived from our U.K. and Israeli operations, respectively. In 2007, approximately 32% of the direct traffic costs in Israel were in GBP and the rest were in New Israeli Shekels (“NIS”). For continuing transactions made in currencies other then US dollar, we use a current conversion rate. For noncontingent past transactions made in currencies other then US dollar we use the conversion rate of the time of transaction . Our costs of revenues are mainly in U.S. dollars and GBP. Most of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenditures are in U.S. dollars and GBP. The remainder of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenditures are in NIS. We anticipate that in 2008 the portion of U.S. dollars will continue to grow although the portion of GBP will stay significant. A devaluation of the GBP or the NIS in relation to the U.S. dollar will have the effect of decreasing the U.S. dollar value of all assets and liabilities that are in GBP or NIS. Conversely, any increase in the value of the GBP or the NIS in relation to the U.S. dollar will have the effect of increasing the U.S. dollar value of all GBP or NIS assets and the U.S. dollar amounts of any GBP or NIS liabilities and expenses. Inflation in any of the countries where we operate would affect our operational results if we shall not be able to match our revenues with growing expenses caused by inflation. If the rate of inflation causes a rise in salaries or other expenses and the market conditions don't allow us to raise prices proportionally, it will have a negative effect on the value of our assets and on our potential profitability. -73- CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE On January 18, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Company, in accordance with its rotation of independent auditors policy, replaced Chaifetz & Schreiber, P.C. as our independent auditors and appointed Stark Winter Schenkein & Co., LLP (“SWS”), an independent member of BKR International, as independent auditors of the Company.

ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS The Nevada Revised Statutes (“NRS”) Under Nevada law, a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, except an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the action, suit or proceeding if he: (a) Is not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138; or (b) Acted in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not, of itself, create a presumption that the person is liable pursuant to NRS 78.138 or did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or that, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. -106- Under our Bylaws, the corporation shall indemnify any individual made a party to a proceeding because he is or was an officer, director, employee or agent of the corporation against liability incurred in the proceeding, all pursuant to and consistent with the provisions of NRS 78.751, as amended from time to time. The expenses of officers and directors incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the corporation as they are incurred and in advance of the final deposition of the action, suit or proceeding, but only after receipt by the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of the officer or director on terms set by the Board of Directors, to repay the expenses advanced if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation. The indemnification permitted herein is intended to be to the fullest extent permissible under the laws of the State of Nevada, and any amendments thereto. The Company's Bylaws Article 7 of our Bylaws provides that subject to the provisions of the Nevada Corporation Law, we shall indemnify any person against liabilities and other expenses incurred as the result of defending or administering any pending or anticipated legal issue in connection with service to the Company, if it is determined by the Board that such person acted in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed was in the best interest of the Company. Indemnification Agreements Following a March 29, 2006 resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its Directors and Officers.

UNDERTAKINGS The undersigned Company hereby undertakes to: (1) File, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement to: (i) Include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”); (ii) Reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information in the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of the securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of a prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective Registration Statement, and -122- (iii) Include any additional or changed material information on the plan of distribution. (2) For determining liability under the Securities Act, treat each post-effective amendment as a new Registration Statement of the securities offered, and the offering of the securities at that time to be the initial bona fide offering. (3) File a post-effective amendment to remove from registration any of the securities that remain unsold at the end of the offering. (4) For determining liability of the undersigned small business issuer under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned small business issuer pursuant to this Registration Statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned small business issuer will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned small business issuer relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned small business issuer or used or referred to by the undersigned small business issuer; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned small business issuer or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned small business issuer; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned small business issuer to the purchaser. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Company has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Company of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Company in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Company will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue (5) For determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, it will treat each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus as a new Registration Statement for the securities offered in the Registration Statement, and that offering of the securities at that time as the initial bona fide offering of those securities. For the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser: Each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a Registration Statement relating to an offering, other than Registration Statements relying on Rule 430B or other prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the Registration Statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided however, that no statement made in a Registration Statement or prospectus that is part of the Registration Statement or made in a document incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or prospectus that is part of the Registration Statement will, as to purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the Registration Statement or prospectus that was part of the Registration Statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. -123- SIG NATU RES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the Registrant has duly caused this Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Lubbock, State of Texas on April 18, 2008.
