Baxalta Baxalta is a global, innovative biopharmaceutical leader with a sustainable portfolio of differentiated therapies that seek to address unmet medical needs across many disease areas, including hemophilia, immunology and oncology. More specifically, the company develops, manufactures and markets a diverse portfolio of treatments for hemophilia and other bleeding disorders, immune deficiencies, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, burns and shock, and other chronic and acute medical conditions. Baxalta is also investing in new disease areas, including oncology, as well as emerging technology platforms, including gene therapy and biosimilars. Baxaltas business strategy is aimed at improving diagnosis, treatment and standards of care across a wide range of bleeding disorders and other rare chronic and acute medical conditions, capitalizing on the companys differentiated portfolio, ensuring the sustainability of supply to meet growing demand for therapies across core disease areas, and accelerating innovation by developing and launching new treatments while leveraging its expertise into new emerging therapeutics through acquisitions and collaborations. Baxaltas 2014 worldwide net sales totaled $6.0 billion, an increase of 7% over 2013 at actual foreign currency exchange rates and 8% at constant foreign currency exchange rates. In 2014, the company achieved net income from continuing operations of $1.2 billion while also incurring research and development (R&D) expenses of $820 million. Strengths Baxalta possesses a number of competitive advantages that distinguish the company from its competitors, including: Differentiated portfolio of leading products. Baxaltas portfolio consists of a number of market-leading therapies across core disease areas, particularly in hematology and immunology. Baxaltas portfolio includes a variety of additional differentiated therapies for the treatment of bleeding disorders and chronic and acute medical conditions, including hemophilia A, hemophilia B, acquired hemophilia, inhibitor treatments, primary immunodeficiency (PID) and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The company believes that all of these treatment 1 Table of Contents areas have significant growth potential, as they remain under-diagnosed and under-treated on a global basis. Baxalta intends to capitalize on this growth opportunity by increasing awareness and diagnosis, expanding access to therapies, enhancing market penetration and improving standards of care. Baxaltas core disease therapies include:  ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)], the leading recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) therapy for the treatment of children and adults with hemophilia A;  FEIBA [Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Complex], a leading inhibitor management therapy;  GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)], a liquid formulation of the antibody-replacement therapy for the treatment of immune deficiencies and certain neurological disorders; and  HYQVIA [Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (Human) with Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase], an immune globulin with a recombinant human hyaluronidase for the treatment of PID in adults. Diverse biopharmaceuticals pipeline. Building and advancing Baxaltas existing product pipeline is a key driver of future growth. The current pipeline includes programs in hematology, oncology, immunology and biosimilars with a focus on rare diseases and areas of unmet medical need. The company has more than 20 programs under development, including those in development with collaboration partners, as it applies internal scientific expertise in addition to advancing the pipeline through a number of recent acquisitions and collaborations. Since the beginning of 2014, Baxalta received approval for five products in the United States (including further developments or indications of existing products), recently submitted two products for approval in the U.S., and currently has five programs, including collaborations, in late-stage clinical trials. Worldwide commercial infrastructure and opportunity for continued geographic penetration and expansion. Baxaltas products are sold in approximately 100 countries. Baxalta has strong and extensive sales, marketing, and distribution networks around the world to support its products. In 2014, Baxalta had sales of $2.9 billion outside of the United States, representing nearly half of Baxaltas total sales, including sales to emerging markets of $1.2 billion, representing 20% of total sales. Continued penetration of under-diagnosed and under-treated therapies will help drive growth across selected geographies. High-quality products and world-class manufacturing operations . Baxalta has an established heritage as a leader in quality manufacturing. Baxalta has strong, globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at its manufacturing sites, and conducts and supports internal and external inspections and audits at these sites. Baxaltas regional and global manufacturing teams seek to ensure that all of its contract manufacturers adhere to Baxaltas standards of manufacturing quality. The company utilizes a diversified network of proprietary manufacturing sites and contract manufacturers to maximize operational efficiencies and to help meet demand for the companys therapies. Baxaltas extensive manufacturing and supply chain expertise and capabilities position the company well to provide critical therapies for distribution in all major regions of the world and to meet growing demand over the long-term. Financial flexibility to fuel future growth. Baxalta retains strong financial flexibility, freeing the company to reinvest in the business and fuel future growth. In 2014, Baxalta generated $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and spent $970 million on capital expenditures. Baxalta anticipates that its business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow to allow the company to continue to invest in its new and expanding product pipeline and other areas to support and expand its business through both capital investments and strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and collaborations. Experienced management team with track record of successful performance. Baxaltas management team has a strong track record of performance and execution. Dr. Ludwig N. Hantson, who has served as a Corporate Vice President and President of BioScience at Baxter since 2010, is expected to be Baxaltas President and Chief 2 Table of Contents Executive Officer. Dr. Hantson brings with him more than 25 years of industry experience, including in executive roles, serving as regional, division and country head at several large biopharmaceutical companies, as well as in leadership positions in the areas of commercial operations, sales and marketing, and clinical research and development. Robert J. Hombach, who has served more than 25 years in various capacities at Baxter, including as Baxters Chief Financial Officer since 2010, is expected to be Baxaltas Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations Officer. The management team is also expected to include:  John Glasspool as Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate Strategy and Customer Operations, with more than 20 years of industry experience, including most recently as Baxters Vice President, New Therapies and Market Developments since 2012;  Brian Goff as Executive Vice President and President, Hematology, with more than 20 years of industry experience, including most recently as Global Franchise Head of Hemophilia for Baxter;  Anne-Marie Law as Executive Vice President and Head of Human Resources, with more than 25 years of human resources experience, including, prior to joining Baxalta, as Senior Vice President, Human Resources McKesson Specialty Health/US Oncology;  Ronald K.

Strategies Baxalta is seeking to grow its business by, among other things: Enhancing access through increasing awareness and diagnosis and improving standards of care. Baxalta is committed to supporting efforts to improve diagnosis and enhancing standards of care. A number of disease areas, such as hemophilia, primary immune deficiency (PID), multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and von Willebrand disease (VWD), are currently under-diagnosed and under-treated. For example, Baxalta believes based on historical data that diagnosis rates remain well under 50% for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, hemophilia A, hemophilia B and PID, and up to an estimated 60% for MMN. As awareness and diagnosis increases, Baxalta believes it can capitalize on its existing and developing product portfolio to address the rising demand for these areas of unmet medical need. Baxalta also seeks to differentiate itself through its commitment to increasing standards of care for its patients. As an example, in June 2014, Baxalta obtained European CE marking of myPKFiT, a new web-based individualized dosing device for prophylactic treatment of hemophilia A with ADVATE, which allows physicians to calculate personalized ADVATE treatment regimens based on patient information and individual pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. 3 Table of Contents Further penetrating targeted emerging markets . In many emerging markets, population growth and economic development are driving increased demand for therapies such as Baxaltas. In addition, rising standards of living and healthcare in such markets increase the global marketplace for Baxaltas therapies. Based on the companys diverse product portfolio and its history of successfully utilizing regional and local sales and distribution capabilities, Baxalta believes that the company is well-positioned for growth in these emerging markets. For example, Baxalta believes that it has further opportunities to expand in targeted emerging markets by reaching new customers, by introducing more of the companys therapies into these markets and by supporting the adoption of the companys products. Baxalta believes that the company will be able to efficiently respond to the needs of its emerging market customers and provide strong customer service and support in these markets. Exploring additional models to partner with governments and other third parties. Baxalta is exploring alternative business models to partner with governments and other large patient care organizations to become the partner of choice, particularly in a number of emerging markets where utilization is very low. For example, in 2012 the company entered into an exclusive 20-year partnership with Hemobrás (Empresa Brasileira de Hemoderivado e Biotechnologia) to provide hemophilia patients in Brazil, the worlds third-largest hemophilia market, greater access to rFVIII therapy for the treatment of hemophilia A. The company has also entered into a 10-year contract manufacturing agreement with Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation of the Netherlands to enhance the supply of plasma-derived treatments for immune deficiencies, hemophilia, trauma and other critical conditions. These and similar measures will help to build and drive innovation and brand excellence on a global basis. Augmenting Baxaltas product portfolio through organic growth, acquisitions and collaborations. Baxalta intends to continue to develop and grow its product portfolio through internal research and development (R&D) as well as through external acquisitions and collaborations. These R&D efforts enable the company to deliver innovative products to address areas of unmet medical need, and enhance current therapies so they remain relevant for Baxaltas customers. Baxalta leverages its brand leadership to position the company to capitalize on enhancing access with the introduction of new therapeutics and indications. While continuing to leverage its expertise and develop therapies in its core disease areas, Baxalta intends to further diversify its product portfolio and pipeline by shifting to therapies for diseases beyond hemophilia, such as blood disorders, liquid and solid tumors and immunologic conditions. Baxalta incurred R&D expenses of $820 million in 2014 and believes that at least seven new products in its R&D portfolio have the potential to reach the market by 2018, along with several other indications or developments with respect to existing products and geographic expansions of such products. Baxalta also intends to continue to grow its business through acquisitions, asset purchases, in-licensing transactions, development, supply and distribution agreements and other strategic partnerships, as well as through the growth of its existing products resulting from such factors as increased awareness and diagnosis, and further penetration into emerging markets. Baxalta has entered into several significant collaborations, alliances and other business development transactions to support its growth, including:  AesRx Acquisition. In June 2014, Baxalta acquired AesRx, LLC (AesRx), obtaining AesRxs program related to the development and commercialization of treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD), including BAX 555 (f/k/a Aes-103), an investigational prophylactic treatment for SCD currently in a Phase II clinical trial as part of an ongoing collaboration with the National Institute of Health (NIH)s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) through its Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program.  Chatham Acquisition. In April 2014, Baxalta acquired Chatham Therapeutics, LLC (Chatham), gaining broad access and intellectual property rights to its gene therapy platform for the treatment of 4 Table of Contents hemophilia B (BAX 335, currently in Phase I clinic trials) as well as a preclinical hemophilia A program, and the potential future application to additional hemophilia treatments.  Coherus Collaboration. Baxalta has established a collaboration with Coherus BioSciences, Inc. (Coherus) to develop and commercialize CHS-0214/BAX 2200, a biosimilar product candidate for ENBREL ® (etanercept), indicated for the treatment of certain autoimmune deficiencies, in Europe, Canada, Brazil and other markets. This is Baxaltas most advanced biosimilar, currently in Phase III clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. In early stage clinic trials, Coherus has demonstrated pharmacokinetic (PK) equivalence versus the innovator molecule.  CTI BioPharma Collaboration . Baxalta acquired rights under a worldwide licensing agreement with CTI BioPharma Corp. (f/k/a Cell Therapeutics, Inc.) (CTI BioPharma) to develop and commercialize pacritinib (BAX 2201), a novel investigational JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor that recently completed Phase III trials for myelofibrosis, a chronic, malignant bone marrow disorder, and is currently in Phase II trials for acute myeloid leukemia. Baxalta has exclusive commercialization rights for all indications outside the United States, and will jointly commercialize pacritinib in the United States with CTI BioPharma. Positive top-line results from the Phase III trials were announced in March 2015.  GLASSIA. In 2010, Baxalta acquired exclusive distribution and licensing rights in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada to GLASSIA, the first ready-to-use liquid alpha1-proteinase inhibitor used to treat alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, through an agreement with Kamada Ltd. (Kamada), together with a technology transfer allowing Baxalta to implement Kamadas related production technology.  HYQVIA . HYQVIA is a product consisting of human normal immunoglobulin (IG) and recombinant human hyaluronidase (licensed from Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. in 2007). HYQVIA was approved in Europe in 2013 for adults with PID syndromes and myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with severe secondary hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections, and also in the United States in 2014 for adults with PID.  Merrimack Collaboration . In September 2014, Baxalta entered into an exclusive license and collaboration agreement with Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Merrimack) for the development and commercialization of nanoliposomal irinotecan injection, or nal-IRI (MM-398), an investigational drug candidate for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treated with a gemcitabine-based therapy, for all potential indications outside the United States and Taiwan. A Phase III trial has been completed, and Baxalta filed for approval for second-line pancreatic cancer in the European Union (EU) in May 2015. In November 2014, FDA granted nal-IRI Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who have been previously treated with gemcitabine-based therapy. Fast Track is designed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to facilitate and expedite the development and review of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.  Momenta Collaboration. Baxalta is collaborating with Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta) on the development and commercialization of M923/BAX 2923, a biosimilar product candidate for HUMIRA ® (adalimumab), which is currently in early-stage development. In December 2014, a European clinical trial application for M923/BAX 2923 was accepted. In June 2015, Baxalta entered into an agreement with SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group (SFJ) relating to M923/BAX 2923 whereby SFJ will fund up to $200 million of specified development costs related to Baxaltas M923/BAX 2923 program in exchange for payments in the event the product obtains regulatory approval in the United States and/or Europe. The contingent success payments, which would total approximately 5.5 times the incurred development costs, would be paid in installments over several years following the date(s) of regulatory approval. 5 Table of Contents  OBIZUR . In 2013, Baxalta acquired the investigational hemophilia compound and related assets from Inspiration BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (Inspiration), as well as certain other assets, including manufacturing operations, from Ipsen Pharma S.A.S. in conjunction with Inspirations bankruptcy proceedings. In October 2014, OBIZUR was approved for the treatment of acquired hemophilia A in the United States and is currently under regulatory review in Europe and Canada.  SuppreMol Acquisition. In March 2015, Baxalta acquired SuppreMol GmbH (SuppreMol), a biopharmaceutical company based in Germany with an early-stage development portfolio of novel treatment options for autoimmune and allergic diseases, focusing on the modulation of Fc receptor signaling pathways, an immune target that could have broad applications in autoimmune disorders. SuppreMols pipeline includes lead candidate SM101, an investigational immunoregulatory treatment that has completed Phase IIa studies in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP, a disorder causing low platelet levels) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, a disorder in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue). Accessing new products and technologies through scientific partnerships . Baxalta intends to continue to expand its network of research partnerships around the globe in order to gain access to new technologies, including its relationships with universities and other public and private institutions. The transition of Baxaltas R&D hub to Cambridge, Massachusetts, will enhance its ability to leverage expertise in the greater Boston area and forge strategic partnerships with leading biotechnology companies and academic and research institutions. In addition, Baxalta will have the ability to explore opportunities to enter into collaboration agreements and external alliances with other parties under its own standalone growth and investment strategies. Continuing to provide high-quality products and drive manufacturing efficiencies . Baxalta is a leader in quality manufacturing. Baxaltas global commercial and manufacturing teams collaborate on various operational efficiency initiatives, including yield improvements, procurement, site and area synergies and manufacturing support rationalization, intended to improve Baxaltas manufacturing margins. Baxaltas manufacturing and supply chain provide it with a flexible and scalable global platform for continued expansion, including in emerging markets. Managing the product portfolio to maximize value. Baxalta plans to continue its investment in products with durable sales, while making adjustments as necessary to increase the value of its product portfolio. Baxalta intends to achieve this objective in a variety of ways depending on product and circumstances by, for example, identifying supply chain efficiencies, pursuing additional indications, and employing strong product lifecycle management. Baxalta believes that its approach will allow the company to maintain a strong operating margin on existing products. Risks Related to Baxaltas Business and the Separation An investment in Baxalta common stock is subject to a number of risks, including risks related to the separation and distribution. The following list of risk factors is not exhaustive. Please read the information in the section captioned Risk Factors for a more thorough description of these and other risks. Risks Related to Baxaltas Business  If Baxalta is unable to successfully introduce new products or fails to keep pace with advances in technology, Baxaltas business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  Baxalta is currently dependent upon its three principal products: ADVATE, FEIBA and GAMMAGARD LIQUID. If Baxalta is unable to successfully introduce new products, encounters 6 Table of Contents negative developments with respect to its existing products or fails to keep pace with advances in technology, Baxaltas business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely effected.  Issues with product quality could have a material adverse effect upon Baxaltas business, subject Baxalta to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in Baxalta or its products.  Baxalta is subject to a number of existing laws and regulations in a changing regulatory environment, non-compliance with which could adversely affect Baxaltas business, financial condition and results of operations.  ADVATE and Baxaltas other products face substantial competition in the product markets in which it operates.  If Baxalta is unable to successfully implement its business development strategy or expand its product portfolio through external collaborations, Baxaltas business could suffer and Baxaltas business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.  If reimbursement for Baxaltas current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or abroad, its business could suffer. Risks Related to the Separation and Distribution  Baxalta has no history operating as an independent company, and Baxaltas historical and pro forma financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that it would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of its future results.  Baxalta may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation and distribution, and the separation and distribution may adversely affect Baxaltas business. The Separation and Distribution On March 27, 2014, Baxter announced that it intended to separate its biopharmaceuticals business from its medical products business. The medical products business offers a broad portfolio of intravenous (IV) solutions and nutritional therapies, infusion pumps and administration sets, premixed and other injectable drugs, inhalation anesthetics, hospital-based biosurgery products, as well as a comprehensive portfolio of products and services to treat end-stage renal disease across the full continuum of care. The biopharmaceuticals business offers a differentiated portfolio of innovative therapies that seek to address unmet medical needs across many disease areas, including hematology, immunology and oncology. On June 5, 2015, the Baxter Board of Directors approved the distribution of approximately 80.5% of Baxaltas issued and outstanding shares of common stock on the basis of one share of Baxalta common stock for each share of Baxter common stock held as of the close of business on June 17, 2015, the record date. Baxters plan to transfer less than all of the Baxalta common stock to its shareholders in the distribution is motivated by its desire to establish, in an efficient and nontaxable, cost effective manner, an appropriate capital structure for each of Baxter and Baxalta, including by reducing, directly or indirectly, Baxter indebtedness during the 18-month period following the distribution. These reductions are expected to meaningfully address Baxters liquidity management considerations. Baxter intends to transfer any Baxalta common stock not distributed in the distribution to Baxters creditors in satisfaction of outstanding obligations of Baxter (including by way of one or more contributions to the Baxter U.S. pension plan) and possibly to Baxters shareholders as a dividend or in exchange for Baxter stock, in each case during the 18-month period following the distribution. To the extent 7 Table of Contents Baxter holds any Baxalta common stock at the end of the 18-month period, Baxter will dispose of such stock in one or more transactions (including potentially through secondary transactions) as soon as practicable, taking into account market conditions and sound business judgment, but in no event later than five years after the distribution. Baxaltas Post-Distribution Relationship with Baxter Baxalta will enter into a separation and distribution agreement with Baxter, which is referred to in this prospectus as the separation agreement or the separation and distribution agreement. In connection with the separation, Baxalta will enter into various other agreements to effect the separation and provide a framework for its relationship with Baxter after the distribution, including a transition services agreement, a long term services agreement, a tax matters agreement, a manufacturing and supply agreement, an employee matters agreement, a trademark license agreement, a Galaxy license agreement, an international commercial operations agreement, a shareholders and registration rights agreement with respect to Baxters continuing ownership of Baxalta common stock and certain other commercial agreements. These agreements will provide for the allocation between Baxter and Baxalta of Baxters assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property and employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after Baxaltas separation from Baxter. These agreements will also govern certain relationships between Baxter and Baxalta after the separation. For additional information regarding the separation agreement and other transaction agreements, see the sections entitled Risk FactorsRisks Related to the Separation and Distribution and Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions. Reasons for the Separation The Baxter Board of Directors believes that separating the biopharmaceuticals business from the remainder of Baxter is in the best interests of Baxter and its shareholders for a number of reasons, including that:  the separation will allow greater management focus on the distinct businesses of biopharmaceuticals and medical products by Baxalta and Baxter, respectively;  the separation will give each of Baxter and Baxalta the ability to commercialize new and existing product offerings more effectively on a global basis;  the separation will give each of Baxter and Baxalta the ability to drive innovation and allocate necessary resources to areas presenting the highest growth potential;  the separation will give each of Baxter and Baxalta the flexibility to pursue aligned growth and investment strategies resulting in revenue acceleration, improved profitability and enhanced returns;  the separation will allow each of Baxter and Baxalta to capitalize on emerging healthcare trends while enhancing operational, commercial and scientific effectiveness;  the separation will allow investors to separately value each of Baxter and Baxalta based on their unique investment identities, including the merits, performance and future prospects of their respective businesses, providing investors with two distinct and targeted investment opportunities;  the separation will allow each of Baxter and Baxalta to generate strong cash flow and be well capitalized with a strong balance sheet, an investment-grade profile and a disciplined approach to capital allocation;  the separation will create an independent equity structure that will afford Baxalta direct access to the capital markets and facilitate the ability to capitalize on its unique growth opportunities and effect future acquisitions using its common stock. 8 Table of Contents The Baxter Board of Directors considered a number of potentially negative factors in evaluating the separation, including risks relating to the creation of a new public company, possible increased overall costs as well as one-time separation costs, but concluded that the potential benefits of the separation outweighed these factors. For more information, see the sections entitled The Separation and DistributionReasons for the Separation and Risk Factors included elsewhere in this prospectus.

The address of Baxaltas principal executive offices is One Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, Illinois 60015. Baxaltas telephone number is 224-940-2000. Baxalta will also maintain an Internet site at www.baxalta.com. Baxaltas website and the information contained therein or connected thereto shall not be deemed to be incorporated herein, and you should not rely on any such information in making an investment decision. 9 Table of Contents SUMMARY HISTORICAL AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION The following table sets forth summary historical financial information for the periods indicated below. The summary balance sheet data as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and the summary statement of income data for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 have been derived from Baxaltas audited combined financial statements which are included elsewhere in this prospectus. The summary balance sheet data as of March 31, 2015 and the summary statement of income data for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 are derived from Baxaltas unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements which are included elsewhere in this prospectus. The unaudited condensed combined interim financial data have been prepared on a basis consistent with the basis on which Baxaltas audited combined financial statements have been prepared except for income taxes which are based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. In the opinion of Baxaltas management, the unaudited condensed combined interim financial data includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of such data. These interim results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year. The combined financial statements were prepared on a carve-out basis for purposes of presenting Baxaltas financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Baxalta did not operate as a standalone entity in the past and accordingly the summary financial data presented herein is not necessarily indicative of Baxaltas future performance and does not reflect what Baxaltas financial performance would have been had the company operated as an independent publicly traded company during the periods presented. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of income data for the year ended December 31, 2014 and for the three months ended March 31, 2015 assumes that the separation occurred as of January 1, 2014. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet assumes that the separation occurred as of March 31, 2015. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that Baxalta believes are reasonable. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed financial information is for illustrative and informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what the financial position or results of operations would have been if Baxalta had operated as an independent company during the periods presented or if the transactions described therein had actually occurred as of the date indicated, nor does it project the financial position at any future date or the results of operations for any future period. Please see the notes to the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for a discussion of adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements. 10 Table of Contents The summary financial information should be read in conjunction with the discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements and corresponding notes, the audited combined financial statements and corresponding notes and the unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements and corresponding notes included elsewhere in this prospectus.

For the three months ended March 31, For the years ended December 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 2014 2013 2012 Other Financial Data: Adjusted net income from continuing operations 2 $ 295 $ 333 $ 1,585 $ 1,432 $ 1,390 2 Adjusted net income from continuing operations is calculated as net income from continuing operations excluding special items and is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Upfront and milestone payments related to collaborative arrangements that have been expensed as research and development (R&D) are excluded as special items because they are uncertain and often result in a different payment and expense recognition pattern than internal R&D activities. Intangible asset amortization is excluded as a special item to facilitate an evaluation of current and past operating performance, particularly in terms of cash returns, and is similar to how management internally assesses performance. Other special items are excluded because they are highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the companys reported operations for a period. Non-GAAP financial measures may provide a more complete understanding of the companys operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the companys results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one 11 Table of Contents period to another. Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may enhance an investors overall understanding of the companys past financial performance and prospects for the future. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor the companys performance, and in some cases for purposes of determining incentive compensation. The company strongly encourages investors to review its combined financial statements in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.

Use of proceeds Baxalta intends to use any proceeds received by it from the exercise of stock options covered by the 2015 Plan for general corporate purposes. Listings Baxalta common stock began trading on a limited market, commonly known as a when-issued trading market, on June 15, 2015, and Baxalta expects that regular-way trading of Baxalta common stock will begin on the first trading day following the completion of the distribution. Baxaltas common stock has been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol BXLT. 13 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this prospectus in evaluating Baxalta and Baxaltas common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect Baxaltas results of operations or financial condition. The risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to Baxaltas business, risks related to the separation and distribution, and risks related to Baxaltas common stock. Risks Related to Baxaltas Business If Baxalta is unable to successfully introduce new products, encounters negative developments with respect to its existing products or fails to keep pace with advances in technology, Baxaltas business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Baxalta currently relies on the revenues generated from its principal products, including ADVATE, FEIBA and GAMMAGARD LIQUID. Although Baxalta has developed and continues to develop additional products for commercial introduction, the company may be substantially dependent on sales from these products for many years. Any negative developments relating to any of these products, such as safety or efficacy issues, the introduction or greater acceptance of competing products, constraints on product pricing or price increases, changes in reimbursement policies of third parties or adverse regulatory or legislative developments, may reduce Baxaltas revenues and adversely affect the companys results of operations. Baxalta needs to successfully introduce new products to achieve its strategic business objectives. Product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the research and development process. A successful product development process depends on many factors, including Baxaltas ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate Baxaltas products from those of its competitors. If Baxalta cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, the companys products may become obsolete and its revenue and profitability could suffer. In 2014, Baxalta filed for regulatory approval for BAX 855 in the United States. BAX 855 is an investigational, extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for hemophilia A based on ADVATE. While ADVATE is expected to continue to be an important revenue-driver for the company, BAX 855 would be an alternative for patients preferring an extended half-life treatment, which allows for fewer doses and may be preferable in terms of convenience to some patients. If the company does not receive regulatory approvals for the commercialization of BAX 855, or if the company is unable to successfully execute on its plans to commercialize BAX 855, Baxaltas future revenue growth and results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that extended half-life and similar products otherwise adversely affect ADVATE results. Along with the risk that regulatory approvals may not be received, factors that may prevent the company from successfully meeting its plans for the launch and commercialization of BAX 855 include the availability of competitive products; any reputational damage that may result from adverse experiences or events that may occur with patients treated with BAX 855; any successful challenge with respect to rights in the companys exclusive ownership of the PEGylation technology utilized in BAX 855; and other risks described in these Risk Factors related to the operation of the companys business and the sales of products of the business. Baxaltas pipeline also includes additional extended half-life therapies for hemophilia A and other potential new treatments for hemophilia A and B (including gene therapy), von Willebrand disease and a recombinant treatment for patients with inhibitors, as well as treatments in other areas of unmet medical need (including oncology), each of which remains subject to additional clinical development risks in addition to the factors listed above. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResearch and Development and BusinessBuilding a Diversified Biopharmaceutical Pipeline for a discussion of Baxaltas R&D activities and product pipeline. 14 Table of Contents Issues with product quality could have a material adverse effect upon Baxaltas business, subject Baxalta to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in Baxalta or its products. Baxaltas success depends upon the quality of its products. Quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving the companys products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of Baxaltas products. Baxaltas future success depends on its ability to maintain and continuously improve its quality management program. While Baxalta has one quality system deployed globally that covers the lifecycle of its products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of these products at any stage. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in Baxalta or its current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Additionally, Baxalta has made and continues to make significant investments in assets, including inventory and property, plant and equipment, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products. Product quality or safety issues may restrict the company from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments, potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future. Unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to Baxaltas R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations. Third party suppliers are required to comply with Baxaltas quality standards. Failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays, service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact Baxaltas business results. In addition, some of the raw materials employed in Baxaltas production processes are derived from human and animal origins, requiring robust controls to eliminate the potential for introduction of pathogenic agents or other contaminants. Baxalta is subject to a number of existing laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect Baxaltas business, financial condition and results of operations, and Baxalta is susceptible to a changing regulatory environment. As a biopharmaceutical company, Baxaltas operations and products, and those of its customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The impact of this on Baxalta is direct to the extent the company is subject to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number of situations, even though the company may not be directly regulated by specific biopharmaceutical laws and regulations, Baxaltas products must be capable of being used by its customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations. The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of Baxaltas products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities globally. In particular, regulation of the development, manufacture, and sale of biologics (including biosimilars) may be more complex and require greater expenditures than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review, including multiple regulatory submissions, and approvals are not certain. Baxaltas facilities must be licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in Baxaltas adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in Baxalta and its products, which could adversely affect the companys sales. The requirements of regulatory 15 Table of Contents authorities, including interpretative guidance, are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review, result in product launch delays or otherwise increase Baxaltas costs. For information on current regulatory issues affecting Baxalta, see BusinessRegulation. In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur, that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required, that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the companys operations and combined financial statements. The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that biopharmaceutical companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including the parts that relate to off-label promotion of products) and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, the Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG), the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission. The DOJ and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of biopharmaceutical companies. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of biopharmaceutical companies sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally. The laws and standards governing the promotion, sale and reimbursement of Baxaltas products and those governing Baxaltas relationships with healthcare providers and governments, including the Sunshine Act enacted under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. Baxalta has compliance programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address these risks. Nonetheless, these programs and policies may not always protect the company from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws. Violations, or allegations of violations, of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on Baxaltas business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information related to Baxaltas ethics and compliance programs, see BusinessEthics and Compliance. For more information related to Baxaltas legal proceedings, see Note 14 to the audited combined financial statements. The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Baxalta to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of the companys sales and marketing practices and may subject the company to enforcement actions which could adversely affect Baxaltas business, financial condition and results of operations. Baxaltas products face substantial competition in the product markets in which it operates. Baxalta faces substantial competition throughout its business from international and domestic biopharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product effectiveness and quality, patient convenience, and technological innovation. Competition may increase further as existing competitors enhance their offerings or additional companies enter Baxaltas markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with Baxaltas products. For example, ADVATE may face additional competition from extended half-life treatments, such as ELOCTATE ® from Biogen Idec, which allow for fewer doses compared to ADVATE and may be preferable in terms of 16 Table of Contents convenience to some patients. If Baxaltas competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, the companys products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If Baxaltas competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than the company does, its operations will likely be negatively affected. If Baxalta is forced to reduce its prices due to increased competition, Baxaltas business could become less profitable. The companys sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with customers (including with hospitals, treatment centers and other health care providers, distributors, GPOs and IDNs) are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise. If Baxaltas business development activities are unsuccessful, Baxaltas business could suffer and Baxaltas financial performance could be adversely affected. As part of Baxaltas long-term strategy, Baxalta is engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of the companys resources. Baxaltas success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including Baxaltas ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; whether Baxalta is able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to the company; the strength of the other companys underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology; and Baxaltas ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into Baxaltas existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations. Certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact Baxaltas ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions. If Baxalta is unsuccessful in its business development activities, the company may be unable to meet its financial targets and Baxaltas financial performance could be adversely affected. For more information on recent business development activities, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResearch and Development and BusinessStrategies. Baxaltas growth strategy depends upon its ability to expand its product portfolio through external collaborations, which, if unsuccessful, may adversely affect the development and sale of its products. Baxalta intends to continue to explore opportunities to enter into collaboration agreements and external alliances with other parties, focusing on hematology, oncology and immunology. These third party collaborators may include other biopharmaceutical companies, academic and research institutions, governments and government agencies and other public and private research organizations. These third party collaborators are often directly responsible for clinical development under these types of arrangements, and Baxalta does not have the same level of decision-making capabilities for the prioritization and management of development-related activities as it does for its internal research and development activities. Failures by these partners to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to Baxalta, or any disruption in the relationships between Baxalta and these partners, could have a material adverse effect on Baxaltas pipeline and business. In addition, Baxaltas collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of Baxalta and its partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. These could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or other intellectual property protections, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration. Long-term public-private partnerships with governments and government agencies, including in certain emerging markets, may include technology transfers to support local manufacturing capacity and technical 17 Table of Contents expertise. For example, Baxalta recently became Brazils exclusive provider of rFVIII and will facilitate a technology transfer to support local manufacturing capacity and technical expertise. Baxalta cannot predict whether these types of transfers and arrangements will become more common in the future. These types of technology transfers and similar arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations as a result of lost exclusivity with respect to certain manufacturing and technical capabilities, particularly if this model becomes widely used. Public-private partnerships are also subject to risks of doing business with governments and government agencies, including risks related to sovereign immunity, shifts in the political environment, changing economic and legal conditions and social dynamics. For more information on Baxaltas current pipeline, see BusinessBuilding a Diversified Biopharmaceutical Pipeline. If reimbursement or other payment for Baxaltas current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or abroad, including through the implementation of government-sponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions, cost containment measures, or changes to policies with respect to pricing, taxation or rebates, then Baxaltas business could suffer. Sales of Baxaltas products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of its products are paid by both public and private payors. These payors include Medicare, Medicaid, and private health care insurers in the United States and foreign governments and third-party payors outside the United States. Public and private payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services. Baxalta may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payors which could result in a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and operational results. Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls, the formation of public contracting authorities, product formularies (lists of recommended or approved products), and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of Baxaltas products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other private payors. In much of Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia, for example, the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders, collective purchasing, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products. Additionally, austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for Baxaltas products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for its products. For example, in the United States the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which was signed into law in March 2010, includes several provisions which impact Baxaltas businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations, with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs. Baxalta may also experience downward pricing pressure as the PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers. While it is intended to expand health insurance coverage and increase access to medical care generally, the long-term impact of the PPACA on Baxaltas business and the demand for the companys products is uncertain. As a result of these and other measures, including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted, reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow Baxalta to sell its products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for Baxaltas products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to Baxalta. Baxalta cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives, or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect the companys business. 18 Table of Contents The nature of producing plasma-based therapies may prevent Baxalta from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing its production capacity. The production of plasma-based therapies is a lengthy and complex process, and Baxalta sources its plasma both externally and internally through BioLife Plasma Services L.P. (BioLife), its wholly owned subsidiary. Efforts to increase the collection of plasma or the production of plasma-based therapies may include the construction and regulatory approval of additional plasma collection facilities and plasma fractionation facilities. Baxalta is in the process of building a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility near Covington, Georgia to support growth of its plasma-based treatments, with commercial production scheduled to begin in 2018. The development of such facilities involves a lengthy regulatory process and is highly capital intensive. In addition, access to and transport and use of plasma may be subject to restrictions by governmental agencies both inside and outside the United States. As a result, Baxaltas ability to match its collection and production of plasma-based therapies to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand for its plasma-based therapies or, alternatively, an oversupply of inventory. Failure to meet market demand for Baxaltas plasma-based therapies may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products resulting in a loss of market share or customer confidence. In the event of an oversupply, Baxalta may be forced to lower the prices it charges for some of its plasma-based therapies, close collection and processing facilities, record asset impairment charges or take other action which may adversely affect Baxaltas business, financial condition and results of operations. If Baxalta is unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if it experiences other manufacturing or supply difficulties, its business may be adversely affected. The manufacture of Baxaltas products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality materials. Baxalta manufactures its products in more than ten manufacturing facilities around the world. Baxalta acquires its materials from many suppliers in various countries and works closely with its suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply, but cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful. Further, while efforts are made to diversify its sources of components and materials, in certain instances Baxalta acquires components and materials from a sole supplier. For most of its components and materials for which a sole supplier is used, Baxalta believes that alternative sources of supply exist and has made a strategic determination to use a sole supplier. In very limited instances, however, including with respect to a single material used in ADVATE and HYQVIA, Baxalta relies on sole supplier relationships for which no alternatives have currently been identified. Although Baxalta does carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective. Due to the regulatory environment in which it operates, Baxalta may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect Baxaltas ability to manufacture its products in a timely or cost-effective manner or to make product sales. Many of Baxaltas products are difficult to manufacture. This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, particularly biologics, as well as the strict regulatory regimes governing the companys manufacturing operations. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to the companys reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to the companys customers may also result in quality or safety issues, which could result in significant recalls, remediations or other costs. Several of Baxaltas products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site. Loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect the companys ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences. Because of the time required to obtain regulatory approval and licensing of 19 Table of Contents a manufacturing facility, a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event the company loses manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise not available due to natural disaster, regulatory action or otherwise. If Baxalta is unable to protect its patents or other proprietary rights, or if Baxalta infringes the patents or other proprietary rights of others, its competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged. Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to Baxaltas business. Baxaltas success depends to a significant degree on its ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other countries. Baxalta cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that the patents and other intellectual property rights of Baxalta and its business partners will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling its products or from executing on its strategies. The patent position of a biopharmaceutical company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in Baxaltas industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of Baxaltas patents on products or processes as well as allegations that Baxaltas products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. Baxalta also relies on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen Baxaltas competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to Baxaltas trade secrets or disclose Baxaltas trade secrets to the public. Although Baxalta employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect the companys confidential and proprietary information, these agreements may be breached, and the company may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, Baxaltas trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that Baxaltas employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Furthermore, Baxaltas intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While the company has invested to protect its intellectual property and other data, and continues to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that its precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on the companys reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. Misappropriation or other loss of Baxaltas intellectual property from any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the companys competitive position and may cause it to incur substantial litigation costs. Baxalta faces competition in the development of relationships with research, academic and governmental institutions. Baxalta faces competition for marketing, distribution and collaborative development agreements, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions, and for licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to Baxaltas products. These companies and institutions 20 Table of Contents compete with Baxalta in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to Baxaltas programs. If Baxalta is unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions, its business may suffer. Baxalta is subject to risks associated with doing business globally. Baxaltas operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, increasingly complex labor environments, availability of raw materials, changes in taxation, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws (including the FCPA and the United Kingdom Bribery Act), dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic and political instability (including instability as it relates to the Euro and currencies in certain emerging market countries), disputes between countries, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection, shifts in the political environment or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect Baxaltas global operations could have a material adverse effect on Baxaltas business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on Baxaltas operating results and liquidity. Baxalta generates a substantial portion of its revenue (approximately 50% of its total revenue in 2014) outside the United States. As a result, Baxaltas financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Baxalta cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the ability of the company to mitigate these risks. Baxalta may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors in certain emerging market countries. Baxalta is also exposed to changes in interest rates, and the companys ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if adverse liquidity market conditions occur. For discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, and the ways and extent to which Baxalta attempts to mitigate such impact, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on Baxaltas operating results. Tax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the United States. A significant change to the tax system in the United States, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect upon Baxaltas results of operations. Because Baxalta operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States, it is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions the company has taken and assess additional taxes and related penalties. The company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of its tax provision. However, the company may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits, and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have a material adverse impact on the companys financial results. For more information on the companys income taxes, see Note 13 to the audited combined financial statements. Baxalta is increasingly dependent on information technology systems, and the companys systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from cyber security breaches and data leakage. Baxalta relies upon its technology systems and infrastructure. Baxaltas technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction, unauthorized access and other events. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to Baxaltas systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the 21 Table of Contents public, or may be permanently lost. The increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates additional opportunities for the unintentional dissemination of information, intentional destruction of confidential information stored in the companys systems or in non-encrypted portable media or storage devices. The company could also experience a business interruption, information theft of confidential information, or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber incidents, which may compromise the companys system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at the companys third-party providers or other business partners. While Baxalta has invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, data leakages, breaches in the companys systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon the reputation, business, operations or financial condition of the company. In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as Baxalta seeks to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities. If Baxalta fails to attract and retain key employees Baxaltas business may suffer. Baxaltas ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior management, research and sales and marketing. Competition for top talent in the biopharmaceuticals business can be intense. Baxaltas ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of Baxaltas competitors, compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and industry economic conditions. If Baxalta cannot effectively hire and retain qualified employees, its business could suffer. Baxalta is subject to pending lawsuits. Baxalta is a defendant in certain pending lawsuits and may be named as a defendant in future patent, product liability or other lawsuits, including lawsuits that may relate to its business prior to the separation. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, significant liabilities and diversion of Baxaltas managements time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, Baxalta is not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have a material adverse impact on the business, operations or financial condition of the company. Even claims without merit could subject Baxalta to adverse publicity and require Baxalta to incur significant legal fees. See Note 14 to the audited combined financial statements for more information regarding legal proceedings involving Baxalta. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect Baxaltas business and financial condition. Baxaltas ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products, in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, or deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of Baxaltas customers (including governments) to pay for its products and services, and the amount spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the demand for Baxaltas products and services, declining cash flows, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain of Baxaltas suppliers, which could cause a disruption in Baxaltas ability to produce its products. In addition, global economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses. These conditions may also impact the stability of the Euro or other currencies in which Baxalta does business. Although biosimilars represent a developing opportunity for Baxalta, the market has an uncertain regulatory framework, and Baxalta and its partners may not be able to successfully develop and introduce biosimilar products. Baxalta is actively working to develop and commercialize biosimilar products, including with its partners. Significant uncertainty remains concerning both the regulatory pathway in the United States and in other 22 Table of Contents countries to obtain approval of biosimilar products and the commercial pathway to successfully market and sell such products. The PPACA authorizes FDA to approve biosimilars through a more abbreviated pathway as compared to new biologics. Although in March 2015 FDA approved the first biosimilar drug in the United States, the approval pathway for biosimilar applications remains relatively untested and is subject to ongoing guidance from FDA. Delays and uncertainties in these approval pathways may result in delays or difficulties in the approval of Baxaltas biosimilar products by regulatory authorities, subject Baxalta to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments Baxalta has made in biosimilars. Any such delays, difficulties or unanticipated costs could impact the profitability of the companys biosimilars products. Even if Baxalta and its partners are able to obtain approvals from FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities, the companys biosimilar products and partnerships may not be commercially successful and may not generate profits in amounts that are sufficient to offset the amount invested to develop such biosimilars and obtain such approvals. Biosimilar products could be subject to extensive patent clearances and patent infringement litigation, which could delay or prevent the commercial launch of a product for many years. Market success of biosimilar products will depend on demonstrating to patients, physicians and payors (such as insurance companies) that such products are safe and effective compared to other existing products and offer a more competitive price or other benefit over existing therapies. If Baxaltas competitors develop biosimilar products more quickly or more efficiently than Baxalta does, Baxalta may not be able to effectively execute on its biosimilar strategy. Depending on the outcome of these risks, Baxaltas sales of biosimilar products and related profitability may not meet the companys expectations, and the companys results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. For more information on biosimilars, see BusinessIntellectual Property and Regulation. Risks Related to the Separation and Distribution Baxalta has no history operating as an independent company, and Baxaltas historical and pro forma financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that it would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of its future results. The historical information about Baxalta in this prospectus refers to Baxaltas business as operated by and integrated with Baxter. Baxaltas historical and pro forma financial information included in this prospectus is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Baxter. Accordingly, the historical and pro forma financial information included in this prospectus does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that Baxalta would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that Baxalta will achieve in the future primarily as a result the following factors:  Prior to the distribution, Baxaltas business has been operated by Baxter as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Baxter or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for Baxalta, such as tax, treasury, finance, audit, risk management, legal, information technology, human resources, shareholder relations, compliance, shared services, insurance, employee benefits and compensation. Following the distribution, Baxter will continue to provide some of these functions to Baxalta, as described in Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions. Baxaltas historical and pro forma financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Baxter for such functions. These allocations may not be indicative of the actual expenses Baxalta would have incurred had it operated as an independent, publicly traded company in the periods presented. Baxalta will need to make significant investments to replicate or outsource from other providers certain facilities, systems, infrastructure, and personnel to which Baxalta will no longer have access after its separation from Baxter. These initiatives to develop Baxaltas independent ability to operate without access to Baxters existing operational and administrative infrastructure will be costly to implement. Baxalta may not be able to operate its business efficiently or at comparable costs, and its profitability may decline. 23 Table of Contents  Currently, Baxaltas business is integrated with the other businesses of Baxter. Baxalta is able to utilize Baxters size and purchasing power in procuring various goods and services and has shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. Although Baxalta will enter into transition agreements with Baxter, these arrangements may not fully capture the benefits Baxalta has enjoyed as a result of being integrated with Baxter and may result in Baxalta paying higher charges than in the past for these services. As a separate, independent company, Baxalta may be unable to obtain goods and services at the prices and terms obtained prior to the separation, which could decrease Baxaltas overall profitability. As a separate, independent company, Baxalta may also not be as successful in negotiating favorable tax treatments and credits with governmental entities. This could have a material adverse effect on Baxaltas results of operations and financial condition following the completion of the distribution.  Generally, Baxaltas working capital requirements and capital for its general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, research and development and capital expenditures, have historically been satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of Baxter. Following the completion of the distribution, Baxalta may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements.  After the completion of the distribution, the cost of capital for Baxaltas business may be higher than Baxters cost of capital prior to the distribution.  Baxaltas historical financial information does not reflect the issuance of any debt it may incur as part of the separation and distribution or its obligations to purchase from Baxter certain operations and assets, and assume the corresponding liabilities, of Baxaltas business after the distribution date. Other significant changes may occur in Baxaltas cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from Baxter. For additional information about the past financial performance of Baxaltas business and the basis of presentation of the historical combined financial statements and the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements of Baxaltas business, see Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements, Selected Historical Combined Financial Data, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the historical financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. As Baxalta builds its information technology infrastructure and transitions its data to its own systems, Baxalta could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions. After the distribution, Baxalta will install and implement information technology infrastructure to support its critical business functions, including accounting and reporting, manufacturing process control, quality and compliance systems, customer service, inventory control and distribution. Baxalta may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if it cannot transition effectively from Baxters existing transactional and operational systems, data centers and the transition services that support these functions as Baxalta replaces these systems. Baxalta may not be successful in implementing its new systems and transitioning its data, and it may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated. Baxaltas failure to avoid operational interruptions as it implements the new systems and replaces Baxters information technology services, or its failure to implement the new systems and replace Baxters services successfully, could disrupt its business and have a material adverse effect on its profitability. In addition, if Baxalta is unable to replicate or transition certain systems, its ability to comply with regulatory requirements could be impaired. Baxter may not satisfy its obligations under various transaction agreements that have been or will be executed as part of the separation or Baxalta may not have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transition agreements expire. In connection with the separation, Baxalta and Baxter will enter into a separation and distribution agreement and will enter into various other agreements, including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, a long term services agreement, a manufacturing and supply agreement, an employee matters agreement, a 24 Table of Contents trademark license agreement, a Galaxy license agreement, an international commercial operations agreement, a shareholders and registration rights agreement with respect to Baxters continuing ownership of Baxalta common stock and certain other commercial agreements. These agreements are discussed in greater detail in the section titled Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions. Certain of these agreements will provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the distribution. Baxalta will rely on Baxter to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Baxter is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, Baxalta could incur operational difficulties or losses. If Baxalta does not have its own systems and services in place, or if Baxalta does not have agreements with other providers of these services when the transition agreements terminate, Baxalta may not be able to operate its business effectively and its profitability may decline. While Baxalta is in the process of creating its own, or engaging third parties to provide, systems and services to replace many of the systems and services Baxter currently provides to it, that effort will continue until after the separation from Baxter. Baxalta may not be successful in effectively or efficiently implementing these systems and services or in transitioning data from Baxters systems to Baxaltas. These systems and services may also be more expensive or less efficient than the systems and services Baxter is expected to provide during the transition period. Potential indemnification liabilities to Baxter pursuant to the separation agreement could materially adversely affect Baxalta. The separation agreement with Baxter provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the separation, certain conditions to the distribution and provisions governing the relationship between Baxter and Baxalta with respect to and resulting from the separation. For a description of the separation agreement, see Certain Relationships and Related Person TransactionsAgreements with BaxterThe Separation and Distribution Agreement, which includes additional details regarding the scope of Baxaltas indemnification obligations. Among other things, the separation agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make Baxalta financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the distribution pursuant to the separation agreement, including any pending or future litigation. These indemnification liabilities are intended to ensure that, as between Baxter and Baxalta, Baxalta is responsible for all liabilities assumed by it in connection with the separation, and that any liability incurred by Baxter (including directors, officers, employees and agents) related to Baxaltas failure to satisfy such obligations or otherwise in respect of Baxaltas operation of its business or any breach by Baxalta of the separation agreement or any ancillary agreement is paid by Baxalta; provided that such indemnification obligations shall not extend to individuals who were or become directors, officers, employees or agents of Baxalta if such persons would not be eligible for indemnification under Baxter organizational documents for the underlying matter or if the Baxter directors and officers insurance policy would not cover such persons in connection with the applicable matter. Baxaltas indemnification liabilities are subject to certain limitations under certain ancillary agreements that require Baxalta to act as a service provider for the benefit of Baxter (with Baxter having similar limitations with respect to corresponding services provided to Baxalta) following the distribution, but its other indemnification obligations pursuant to the separation agreement and under other ancillary agreements are not generally subject to such limitations. If Baxalta is required to indemnify Baxter under the circumstances set forth in the separation agreement, Baxalta may be subject to substantial liabilities. There could be significant liability if the distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction. A condition to the spin-off is Baxters receipt of an opinion from KPMG LLP (KPMG) that is in substance and form satisfactory to Baxter and the receipt and continuing validity of a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The opinion, as described below, is expected to conclude that the spin-off of at least 80.1% of the outstanding Baxalta shares to Baxter shareholders and certain related transactions will qualify as tax-free to Baxter and its shareholders under Sections 355, 361 and 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 25 Table of Contents as amended (the Code), except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Baxaltas common stock. Any such opinion is not binding on the IRS. Accordingly, the IRS may reach conclusions with respect to the spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion. The opinion and the private letter ruling will rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Baxter and Baxalta regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters, which, if incomplete, incorrect or not satisfied, could alter the conclusions of the party giving such opinion or ruling. If the spin-off ultimately is determined to be taxable, the spin-off could be treated as a taxable dividend to Baxters shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and Baxters shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, Baxter would recognize a taxable gain to the extent that the fair market value of Baxaltas common stock exceeds Baxters tax basis in such stock on the date of the spin-off. For a description of the sharing of such liabilities between Baxter and Baxalta, see Certain Relationships and Related Person TransactionsAgreements with BaxterTax Matters Agreement. Baxalta may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions after the separation. To preserve the tax-free treatment to Baxter of the separation and the distribution, under the tax matters agreement that Baxalta will enter into with Baxter, Baxalta is restricted from taking any action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the tax matters agreement, for the two-year period following the distribution, it is expected that Baxalta will be prohibited, except in certain circumstances, from:  entering into any transaction resulting in the acquisition of above a certain percentage of its stock or substantially all of its assets, whether by merger or otherwise;  merging, consolidating, or liquidating;  issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds;  repurchasing its capital stock;  ceasing to actively conduct its business; and  taking or failing to take any action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being tax-free. These restrictions may limit Baxaltas ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that it may believe to be in the best interests of its shareholders or that might increase the value of its business. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, Baxalta will be required to indemnify Baxter against any such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of Baxaltas stock or assets, even if it did not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition. After the distribution, certain of Baxaltas executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous or continuing positions at Baxter. Because of their current or former positions with Baxter, certain of Baxaltas initial post-distribution executive officers and directors are expected to own shares of Baxter common stock, options to purchase shares of Baxter common stock or other equity awards. Following the distribution, even though Baxaltas Board of Directors will consist of a majority of directors who are independent, and Baxaltas expected executive officers who are currently employees of Baxter will cease to be employees of Baxter, some Baxalta executive officers and directors will continue to have a financial interest in shares of Baxter common stock. In addition, three of Baxaltas directors will continue serving on the Baxter Board of Directors. Continuing ownership of Baxter common stock and equity awards, or service as a director at both companies, could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if Baxalta and Baxter pursue the same corporate opportunities or face decisions that could have different implications for Baxalta and Baxter. 26 Table of Contents Baxalta may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation, and the separation may adversely affect Baxaltas business. Baxalta may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The separation and distribution is expected to provide the following benefits, among others:  greater management focus on the distinct businesses of biopharmaceuticals and medical products;  the ability to commercialize new and existing product offerings more effectively on a global basis;  the ability to drive innovation and allocate necessary resources to areas presenting the highest growth potential; and  the flexibility to pursue aligned growth and investment strategies resulting in revenue acceleration, improved profitability and enhanced returns. Baxalta may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others:  the separation will require significant amounts of managements time and effort, which may divert managements attention from operating and growing Baxaltas business;  following the separation, Baxalta may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if it were still a part of Baxter;  following the separation, Baxaltas business will be less diversified than Baxters business prior to the separation; and  the other actions required to separate Baxters and Baxaltas respective businesses could disrupt Baxaltas operations. If Baxalta fails to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation, or if such benefits are delayed, the business, financial conditions, and results of operations of Baxalta could be adversely affected. Baxalta may have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms it will receive in its agreements with Baxter. The agreements Baxalta will enter into with Baxter in connection with the separation, including a transition services agreement, a long term services agreement, a tax matters agreement, a manufacturing and supply agreement, an employee matters agreement, a trademark license agreement, a Galaxy license agreement, an international commercial operations agreement, a shareholders and registration rights agreement with respect to Baxters continuing ownership of Baxalta common stock and certain other commercial agreements, were prepared in the context of the separation while Baxalta was still a wholly owned subsidiary of Baxter. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were prepared, Baxalta did not have an independent board of directors or a management team that was independent of Baxter. As a result, the terms of those agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arms-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. Arms- length negotiations between Baxter and an unaffiliated third party in another form of transaction, such as a buyer in a sale of a business transaction, may have resulted in more favorable terms to the unaffiliated third party. See Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions. After the distribution, Baxalta will have indebtedness, which could restrict the companys ability to pay dividends and have a negative impact on the companys financing options and liquidity position. Immediately following the distribution, Baxalta expects to bear a total combined indebtedness for borrowed money of approximately $5 billion as a result of the pre-distribution issuance of senior notes with such aggregate principal amount. Approximately $4 billion of such amount was paid to Baxter as a cash 27 Table of Contents distribution as partial consideration for the contribution of assets to Baxalta by Baxter in connection with the separation, with the remaining net proceeds intended to be used for general corporate purposes, including to fund acquisitions. The company may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. The companys indebtedness may impose restrictions on Baxalta that could have material adverse consequences by:  limiting the companys ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions;  limiting the companys ability to refinance its indebtedness on terms acceptable to the company or at all;  imposing restrictive covenants on the companys operations;  requiring the company to dedicate a significant portion of its cash flows from operations to paying the principal of and interest on its indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for other corporate purposes; and  making the company more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting its ability to withstand competitive pressures. See Description of Material Indebtedness. Challenges in the commercial and credit environment may adversely affect Baxaltas ability to complete the separation and Baxaltas future access to capital. Baxaltas ability to issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for Baxaltas products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers or other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions. Volatility in the world financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect Baxaltas ability to access the capital markets. These conditions may adversely affect Baxaltas ability to obtain and maintain investment grade credit ratings prior to and following the distribution. Risks Related to Baxaltas Common Stock Baxalta cannot be certain that an active trading market for its common stock will develop or be sustained after the distribution, and following the distribution, Baxaltas stock price may fluctuate significantly. Baxalta common stock began trading on a limited market on a when-issued basis as of June 15, 2015, and Baxalta anticipates that when-issued trading will continue until the time of the distribution. However, Baxalta cannot guarantee that an active trading market will develop or be sustained for its common stock after the distribution. Nor can Baxalta predict the prices at which shares of its common stock may trade after the distribution. Similarly, Baxalta cannot predict the effect of the separation and distribution on the trading prices of its common stock or whether the combined market value of the shares of Baxaltas common stock and the shares of Baxter common stock will be less than, equal to or greater than the market value of Baxters common stock prior to the distribution. The market price of Baxaltas common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond Baxaltas control, including:  actual or anticipated fluctuations in Baxaltas operating results;  changes in earnings estimated by securities analysts or Baxaltas ability to meet those estimates;  the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies;  changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which Baxalta operates; and  domestic and worldwide economic conditions. 28 Table of Contents In addition, when the market price of a companys common stock drops significantly, shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. A lawsuit against Baxalta could cause it to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of its management and other resources. Shares of Baxaltas common stock are or will be eligible for future sale, and substantial sales of such shares may cause the price of Baxaltas common stock to decline. Any sales of substantial amounts of Baxaltas common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur, in connection with the distribution or otherwise, may cause the market price of Baxaltas common stock to decline. Upon completion of the distribution, Baxalta expects that it will have an aggregate of approximately 676,424,202 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding on July 1, 2015. These shares will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), unless the shares are owned by one of Baxaltas affiliates, (including Baxter) as that term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act. Baxalta is unable to predict whether large amounts of its common stock will be sold in the open market following the distribution. Baxalta is also unable to predict whether a sufficient number of buyers would be in the market at that time. After completion of the distribution, Baxter will retain approximately 19.5% of Baxaltas total shares outstanding for a limited period of time. Baxter plans to dispose of all of the Baxalta common stock that it retains after the distribution. Such disposition could include one or more subsequent exchanges for debt or equity within the 18-month period following the distribution or otherwise be used to satisfy Baxters outstanding obligations (including through one or more contributions to Baxters U.S. pension plan). Any shares not disposed of by Baxter during such 18-month period will be otherwise disposed of, including potentially through secondary offerings of Baxalta common stock, by Baxter consistent with the business reasons for the retention, but in no event later than five years after the distribution. It is anticipated that Baxter and Baxalta will enter into a shareholders and registration rights agreement with Baxter wherein Baxalta will agree, upon the request of Baxter, to use reasonable best efforts to effect a registration under applicable federal and state securities laws of any shares of Baxaltas common stock retained by Baxter. See Certain Relationships and Related Person TransactionsAgreements with BaxterShareholders and Registration Rights Agreement for additional information. Dispositions of significant amounts of Baxaltas common stock or the perception in the market that this will occur may result in the lowering of the market price of Baxaltas common stock. Baxalta cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of any dividends on its common stock. The Board of Directors of Baxalta is expected to adopt a dividend policy with respect to the payment of dividends on Baxalta common stock following the distribution. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends to shareholders will fall within the discretion of Baxaltas Board of Directors. The Boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as Baxaltas financial condition, earnings, corporate strategy, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that the Board deems relevant. For more information, see Dividend Policy. Baxaltas ability to pay any dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. Baxalta cannot guarantee that it will pay any dividends in the future or continue to pay any dividend if Baxalta commences paying dividends. The current percentage of ownership a shareholder has in Baxalta may be diluted in the future. In the future, the percentage ownership of a given shareholder in Baxalta may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that Baxalta will be granting to its directors, officers and employees. Baxaltas and Baxters employees will have stock options, stock-settled performance share units and stock-settled restricted stock units for Baxaltas common stock after 29 Table of Contents the distribution as a result of an adjustment to their corresponding Baxter awards as described under Executive CompensationEffects of the Separation on Outstanding Executive Compensation Awards; Baxalta Compensation. Baxalta anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional performance share units, restricted stock, stock options or other stock-based awards to its employees after the distribution. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on Baxaltas earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of Baxaltas common stock. In addition, Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation will authorize Baxalta to issue, without the approval of Baxaltas shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over Baxaltas common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as Baxaltas Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Baxaltas common stock. For example, Baxalta could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of Baxaltas directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences Baxalta could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. See Description of Baxaltas Capital Stock. The public announcement of data from clinical studies or news of any developments related to Baxaltas product pipeline may cause significant volatility in its stock price. If the development of any of Baxaltas key pipeline products is delayed or discontinued, the companys stock price could decline significantly. As Baxalta evolves into a standalone company, it will be focusing efforts and resources in building a diversified pipeline of products in existing core disease areas and into new areas of unmet medical need, such as oncology. The company expects that investors may place heightened scrutiny on some of the companys products in development when making investment decisions in Baxalta compared to historic Baxter. The announcement of data from clinical studies by the company or its collaborators or news of any developments related to the companys key pipeline products may cause significant volatility in the companys stock price. Furthermore, the announcement of any negative or unexpected data or the discontinuation of development of any of Baxaltas key pipeline products, or any delay in anticipated timelines for filing for regulatory approval, could cause the companys stock price to decline significantly. There can be no assurance that data from clinical studies will support a filing for regulatory approval or even if approved, that any of Baxaltas key pipeline products will become commercially successful. Certain provisions in Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of Baxalta, which could decrease the trading price of Baxaltas common stock. Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with Baxaltas Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. See Description of Baxaltas Capital StockAnti-Takeover Effects of Various Provisions of Delaware Law and Baxaltas Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws for a further description of certain of these provisions. In addition, because Baxalta has not chosen to be exempt from Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may favor. Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any 30 Table of Contents business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 percent of the corporations outstanding voting stock. Baxalta believes these provisions will protect its shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with Baxaltas Board of Directors and by providing Baxaltas Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Baxaltas Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Baxalta and Baxaltas shareholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. Certain of the agreements that Baxalta will enter into with Baxter will require Baxters consent to any assignment by Baxalta of its rights and obligations under the agreements. The consent and termination rights set forth in these agreements might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may consider favorable. See Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions and Description of Baxaltas Capital Stock for a more detailed description of these agreements and provisions. In addition, an acquisition or further issuance of Baxaltas stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the tax matters agreement, Baxalta would be required to indemnify Baxter for the resulting taxes, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may consider favorable. 31 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus and other materials Baxter and Baxalta have filed or will file with the SEC include, or will include, forward-looking statements.

These proceeds represent the exercise prices for the Baxalta stock options. 35 Table of Contents DIVIDEND POLICY The Board of Directors of Baxalta is expected to adopt a policy with respect to the payment of dividends on Baxalta common stock following the distribution. The company currently expects that Baxalta will pay quarterly cash dividends following the distribution, with the annual amount initially determined based on 15% of the estimate of annual adjusted net income for the applicable period. Notwithstanding the current expectations for Baxaltas future dividend policy, the timing, declaration, amount of, and payment of any dividends following the separation by Baxalta is within the discretion of its Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including Baxaltas financial condition, earnings, corporate strategy, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of Baxaltas debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets, and other factors deemed relevant by Baxaltas Board of Directors. 36 Table of Contents CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth Baxaltas capitalization as of March 31, 2015 on a historical basis and on a pro forma basis to give effect to the pro forma adjustments included in Baxaltas unaudited pro forma financial information. The information below is not necessarily indicative of what Baxaltas capitalization would have been had the separation, distribution and related financing transactions been completed as of March 31, 2015. In addition, it is not indicative of Baxaltas future capitalization. This table should be read in conjunction with Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements, Selected Historical Combined Financial Data, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Baxaltas combined financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this prospectus.

The unaudited pro forma financial statements illustrate the financial impacts of the separation and the related transactions described below. The unaudited pro forma balance sheet gives effect to the separation and related transactions described below as if they had occurred on March 31, 2015. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of income for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2014 assume that the separation and related transactions described below had occurred as of January 1, 2014. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet and statements of income have been derived from Baxaltas historical audited combined annual and unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus and have been adjusted to give effect to the following items related to the separation and the associated transactions:  the contribution by Baxter to Baxalta, pursuant to the separation agreement, of the assets and liabilities that comprise Baxaltas business;  the expected transfer, to Baxalta upon separation, of various corporate and other assets and liabilities not included in Baxaltas historical combined balance sheet;  the incurrence of $5 billion of debt at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.76%, a cash distribution of approximately $4 billion to Baxter, and cash contributed from Baxter in connection with the formation of various Baxalta entities of $850 million;  the anticipated issuance of approximately 676 million shares of Baxaltas common stock; and  the impact of the manufacturing and supply agreement, the transition services agreement and other commercial agreements between Baxter and Baxalta and the provisions contained therein. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what Baxaltas financial position and results of operations actually would have been had the separation and related transactions occurred on the dates indicated, or to project Baxaltas financial performance for any future period. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are based on information and assumptions, which are described in the accompanying notes. The Baxalta historical financial information, which was the basis for the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements, was prepared on a carve-out basis as Baxalta was not operated as a separate, independent company for the periods presented. Accordingly, such financial information reflects an allocation of certain corporate costs for corporate administrative services, including general corporate expenses related to tax, treasury, finance, audit, risk management, legal, information technology, human resources, shareholder relations, compliance, shared services, insurance, employee benefits and incentives and stock-based compensation. These historical allocations may not be indicative of Baxaltas future cost structure; however, the pro forma results have not been adjusted to reflect any potential changes associated with Baxalta being an independent public company as such amounts are estimates that are not factually supportable. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements reported below should be read in conjunction with the section herein entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as the historical audited combined annual and unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. 38 Table of Contents THE BIOPHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS OF BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (A) Reflects the effect of the manufacturing and supply agreement that Baxalta and Baxter will enter into in connection with the separation. The net sales adjustments of $42 million and $157 million reflect the additional sales that Baxalta would have recorded for product manufactured and sold to Baxter for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2014, respectively, under the manufacturing and supply agreement. Pricing under this agreement will reflect Baxaltas costs plus a profit on certain steps of the manufacturing process. The cost of sales adjustments of $42 million and $156 million reflect the impact of costs incurred to manufacture certain products for Baxter as well as the incremental costs that Baxalta would have recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2014, respectively, for purchases of other products from Baxter under the manufacturing and supply agreement. Historically, inventory transfers between Baxter and Baxalta were recorded at cost. (B) Reflects $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 for the difference in costs to be incurred by Baxalta for the services to be provided by Baxter under the transition services agreement. (C) Reflects interest expense related to $5 billion in debt that Baxalta incurred in connection with the separation including amortization of debt discounts related to the original issue discount and fees to be paid by Baxalta. The weighted-average interest rate on the debt including amortization of the debt discount is approximately 3.76%. Interest expense was calculated assuming constant debt levels throughout the periods. Interest expense may be higher or lower if Baxaltas actual interest rate or credit ratings change. A 1/8% change to the annual interest rate would change interest expense by $6.3 million on an annual basis. The pro forma interest expense has not been reduced by the amount that the company believes would have been capitalized had the debt been outstanding for the entire period. Baxalta estimates that this would have been approximately $17 million and $55 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. (D) Reflects the tax effects of the pro forma adjustments at the applicable statutory income tax rates. (E) The number of Baxalta shares used to compute basic earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2014 and for the three months ended March 31, 2015 is based on the number of shares of Baxter common stock outstanding on December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015, respectively, assuming the anticipated distribution ratio of 1 share of Baxalta common stock for each share of Baxter common stock outstanding, and 132 million additional shares to be retained by Baxter. The number of Baxter shares used to determine the assumed distribution reflects the Baxter shares outstanding as of each balance sheet date, which is the most current information as of the date of those financial statements. While the actual future impact of potential dilution from shares of common stock related to equity awards granted to Baxalta employees under Baxters share-based plans will depend on various factors, pro forma diluted shares outstanding were not adjusted as the company does not currently estimate that the future dilutive impact is material. (F) Reflects $5 billion of borrowings incurred in connection with the separation and offset by debt discounts related to the original issue discount and fees to be paid by Baxalta of approximately $60 million. The company distributed approximately $4 billion of the proceeds to Baxter on June 23, 2015 in connection with the separation. (G) Reflects $377 million of additional liabilities related to the net retirement obligations that are expected to be transferred to Baxalta and $124 million of associated deferred tax assets. The statement of income adjustments reflect a reduction in operating expenses of $11 million ($5 million in cost of sales, $5 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $1 million in research and development expenses) for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and $34 million ($16 million in cost of sales, $16 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $2 million in research and development expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2014 associated with the transfer. 42 Table of Contents (H) On the distribution date, Baxters net investment in Baxalta will be re-designated as Baxalta Shareholders Equity and will be allocated between common stock and additional paid in capital based on the number of shares of Baxalta common stock outstanding at the distribution date. The pro forma adjustment reflects the re-designation of Baxters net investment in Baxalta and the impact of the pro forma adjustments described above and below. (I) Reflects certain assets to be transferred to Baxalta pursuant to the separation agreement that were not included in the Companys March 31, 2015 actual balance sheet. These include $43 million of manufacturing equipment and information technology assets and $9 million of associated deferred tax assets, resulting in $2 million of related depreciation expense ($1 million in cost of sales and $1 million in selling, general and administrative expenses) during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and $10 million of related depreciation expense ($7 million in cost of sales and $3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses) during the year ended December 31, 2014. (J) Reflects the proceeds of the debt issued by Baxalta, net of the approximate $4 billion distribution to Baxter and the debt discounts of $60 million, and $850 million of cash that was contributed from Baxter in connection with the formation of various Baxalta entities. As a result of the cash contributed by Baxter, the funds raised in the debt issuance and related cash distribution to Baxter, Baxalta expects to begin operations as an independent company with approximately $1.8 billion in cash. 43 Table of Contents SELECTED HISTORICAL COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA The Baxalta selected combined income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and the selected combined balance sheet data as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 have been derived from Baxaltas audited combined financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this prospectus. The Baxalta selected combined balance sheet data as of December 31, 2012 has been derived from Baxaltas audited combined financial statements. The Baxalta unaudited combined income statement data for the year ended December 31, 2011 has been derived from Baxaltas unaudited combined financial statements. The Baxalta unaudited combined income statement data for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the unaudited combined balance sheet data as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 have been carved out from the underlying financial records of Baxter. The Baxalta combined income statement data for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, and the combined balance sheet data as of March 31, 2015 has been derived from Baxaltas unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this prospectus. The unaudited combined financial statement data has been prepared on a basis consistent with which Baxaltas audited combined financial statements have been prepared, except income taxes for the interim period which are based on the estimated effective tax for the full year, and in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of such data. These interim results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year. The historical combined financial statements have been prepared on a carve-out basis for the purpose of presenting the companys historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

On March 27, 2014, Baxter announced its plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies, one focused on lifesaving medical products and the other focused on developing and marketing innovative biopharmaceuticals. For purposes of the following discussion, Baxalta refers to the biopharmaceuticals business of Baxter prior to the separation. To accomplish the separation, Baxter created a new company, Baxalta Incorporated, to be the parent company for the biopharmaceuticals business. Baxalta Incorporated was incorporated in Delaware on September 8, 2014 and is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of Baxter. To effect the separation, Baxter will make a pro rata distribution of approximately 80.5% of Baxalta Incorporateds common stock to Baxters shareholders. The distribution is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of an opinion from a third party tax advisor that is in substance and form satisfactory to Baxter. See The Separation and Distribution section of this prospectus for additional details on these conditions. After the distribution, Baxalta Incorporated will operate as an independent, publicly-traded company. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Company Overview Baxalta is a global, innovative biopharmaceutical leader with a sustainable portfolio of differentiated therapies that seek to address unmet medical needs across many disease areas, including hemophilia, immunology and oncology. More specifically, the company develops, manufactures and markets a diverse portfolio of treatments for hemophilia and other bleeding disorders, immune deficiencies, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, burns and shock, and other chronic and acute medical conditions. Baxalta is also investing in new disease areas, including oncology, as well as emerging technology platforms, including gene therapy and biosimilars. Baxaltas business strategy is aimed at improving diagnosis, treatment and standards of care across a wide range of bleeding disorders and other rare chronic and acute medical conditions, capitalizing on the companys differentiated portfolio, ensuring the sustainability of supply to meet growing demand for therapies across core disease areas, and accelerating innovation by developing and launching new treatments while leveraging its expertise into new emerging therapeutics through acquisitions and collaborations. Financial Results OverviewThree Months Ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 Three months ended March 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 Percent change Net sales $ 1,361 $ 1,329 2 % Net income from continuing operations $ 262 $ 309 (15 %) 45 Table of Contents Baxaltas global net sales totaled $1.4 billion for the first three months of 2015, an increase of 2% over the prior year period. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 8% over the prior year period. Sales in the United States totaled $755 million in the first three months of 2015, an increase of 7% over 2014, and international sales totaled $606 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year period at actual foreign currency exchange rates and an increase of 10% at constant foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the company drove revenue growth in each of its four product categories. Refer to the Results of OperationsThree Months Ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 section below for further discussion regarding the companys sales. The companys net income from continuing operations was $262 million and $309 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. While the company drove sales growth and gross margin improvement as compared to the prior year period, net income from continuing operations decreased due primarily to $43 million of separation costs incurred during the current year period and a change in other expense (income) from $23 million of income during the three months ended March 31, 2014 to $12 million of expense during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Refer to the Results of OperationsThree Months Ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 section below for further discussion of the companys results. The companys net cash used for operations was $142 million in the first three months of 2015 and $168 million in the first three months of 2014. The company generates significant cash flows from operations on an annual basis; however, the first three months of each year reflect cash outflows for the annual settlement of the companys current income tax payables, which include the full previous years current income tax expense and other current tax amounts. Excluding the impact of this annual settlement of current tax payables, the company generated positive cash flows from operations during both periods. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for further discussion regarding the companys cash flows. Financial Results OverviewFull-Year 2014, 2013 and 2012 Percent change years ended December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 Net sales $ 5,952 $ 5,555 $ 5,310 7 % 5 % Net income from continuing operations $ 1,186 $ 1,288 $ 1,205 (8 %) 7 % Baxaltas global net sales totaled approximately $6.0 billion in 2014, an increase of 7% over 2013. Sales in the United States totaled $3.0 billion in 2014, an increase of 5% over 2013 and international sales totaled more than $2.9 billion, an increase of 9% over 2013. Net sales of the companys largest product category, Hemophilia, increased 7% driven by strong demand for ADVATE. Net sales of Inhibitor Therapies grew 14% due to increased demand for FEIBA. BioTherapeutics and Immunoglobulin Therapies net sales growth in 2014 was 9% and 4%, respectively, reflecting increased sales of albumin products and GAMMAGARD LIQUID, as well as the launch of HYQVIA in the United States in late 2014. In 2013, net sales growth of 5% was driven by Hemophilia, which increased 6% over 2012 driven by increased global demand for ADVATE. Net sales of the Inhibitor Therapies product category also increased 6% in 2013 due to strong global demand for FEIBA. Refer to the Results of OperationsYears Ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 section below for further discussion regarding the companys sales. The companys net income from continuing operations was $1.2 billion in 2014 as compared to $1.3 billion in 2013 and $1.2 billion in 2012. The decrease in 2014 was driven by special items, including research and development (R&D) charges in 2014 of $217 million for both upfront and milestone payments related to collaborative arrangements. Special items are further discussed in the Results of OperationsYears Ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 section below. Excluding the impact of special items, net income from continuing operations increased 11% in 2014 as compared to 2013 due to increased sales, an improvement in gross margin percentage and increased income from equity method investments. Excluding the impact of special 46 Table of Contents items, net income from continuing operations increased 3% in 2013 as compared to 2012 driven by an increase in sales partially offset by increased investments in the R&D pipeline. The companys net cash provided from operations was $1.4 billion in 2014, $1.5 billion in 2013 and $1.4 billion in 2012. The decrease in 2014 reflected increased R&D investments, including milestone payments to collaboration partners, and an increase in tax-related items. Capital expenditures totaled $970 million, $797 million, and $521 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. The increases in capital expenditures in 2014 and 2013 reflected efforts to add capacity to meet long-term expected demand growth for the companys products, and were driven by continued progress in the construction of the companys new manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for further discussion regarding the companys cash flows. Key Commercial Highlights The company continues to grow international sales of ADVATE through expansion into new markets and continued penetration into existing markets, and increased global sales of its Hemophilia product category despite competition from an extended half-life recombinant factor VIII therapy launched in the United States during 2014. The company has now received reimbursement approval in China and additional regulatory approvals for ADVATE in Russia and Turkey in 2014, and it is now approved in over 60 countries. In 2014, the company also received multi-year tender awards for ADVATE in the U.K. and in Australia. The company obtained U.S. approval in 2014 for BAXJECT III, a needleless reconstitution system for ADVATE allowing patients to prepare their treatment with fewer steps compared to the previous process, and has filed for approval in Europe. European CE marking of myPKFiT, a web-based individualized dosing device for prophylactic treatment of hemophilia A with ADVATE, was also obtained in 2014. The device allows physicians to calculate personalized ADVATE treatment regimens based on patient information and individual pharmacokinetic profiles. During 2014, the company made advances in its 20-year public-private partnership with Hemobrás, which the company entered into in 2012. The partnership provides hemophilia patients in Brazil with increased access to ADVATE. ADVATE sales in Brazil exceeded $100 million during 2014, and approximately 40% of the Brazil hemophilia market has been converted to recombinant factor VIII therapy as of the end of 2014. Baxalta is Brazils exclusive provider of recombinant factor VIII and will facilitate a technology transfer to support local manufacturing capacity and technical expertise. Following completion of the technology transfer, Baxalta will receive royalties on recombinant factor VIII product produced by Hemobrás over the duration of the partnership. FEIBA, the companys inhibitor bypass therapy, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine prophylactic use in the United States in late 2013, and other markets in 2014, driving increased demand. FEIBA is used to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A or B who have developed inhibitors. The companys immunoglobulin therapy product offerings, including GAMMAGARD LIQUID, demonstrate strong clinical performance and the company believes there is significant growth potential as the products are used to treat several indications which remain under-diagnosed and under-treated on a global basis. To meet estimated long-term demand growth, the company has made progress in enhancing its overall capacity across its manufacturing network, as well as in the construction of a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia, which is expected to begin commercial production in 2018. Within the BioTherapeutics product category, FLEXBUMIN 5% was approved by FDA in 2014, expanding the FLEXBUMIN product portfolio. FLEXBUMIN is the first and only preparation of human albumin to be packaged in a flexible container, which now includes both 5% in a 250 mL solution and 25% in 50 and 100 mL solutions. The flexible container weighs less, requires less storage space and has a lower risk of breakage compared to glass containers of equal volume. 47 Table of Contents The companys long-term prospects are influenced by the ability to successfully launch new products and therapies. Recent new product launches include:  RIXUBIS: Within the Hemophilia product category, the company received FDA approval for RIXUBIS for the treatment of adults in 2013 and for pediatric use in 2014. The company has also recently received European approval of RIXUBIS for both adult and pediatric use. RIXUBIS is a recombinant based therapy for the treatment of hemophilia B. The product was introduced in the U.S. market in late 2013 and first launched in Europe in April 2015.  HYQVIA: Within the Immunoglobulin Therapies product category, HYQVIA, a differentiated subcutaneous immunoglobulin treatment, received European regulatory approval in 2013 for treatment of adults with primary and secondary immunodeficiency syndromes, and U.S. regulatory approval in 2014 for the treatment of adults with primary immunodeficiency syndrome. HYQVIA was first launched in certain European markets in late 2013 and in the United States in late 2014.  OBIZUR: Within the Inhibitor Therapies product category, OBIZUR received regulatory approval in the United States in 2014 for the treatment of patients with acquired hemophilia A. Baxalta recorded its first commercial sale of OBIZUR in the United States in late 2014. Research and Development Baxalta continues to make substantial investments in R&D in support of its ongoing proprietary research programs and through collaborations with third parties for the development of new products and therapies. R&D expenses were $820 million, or 14% of global net sales, during 2014, and $156 million, or 11% of global net sales during the first three months of 2015. The company believes its R&D pipeline will provide a catalyst for future growth. R&D expenses primarily relate to programs in hematology, oncology, immunology and biosimilars with a focus on rare diseases and areas of unmet medical need. The companys overall R&D strategy includes the continued pursuit of collaborations and partnerships with third parties that are developing new products and therapies. These collaborations generally involve the company obtaining commercialization rights from third parties in exchange for an upfront payment upon execution of the agreement and potential future payments related to the achievement of development, regulatory approval or commercial milestones, as well as royalties. The collaboration arrangements include joint steering committees with representatives from both parties. The companys significant collaborative arrangements include an agreement with Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Merrimack) for the development and commercialization of all potential indications of nal-IRI (MM-398), including pancreatic cancer, in most markets outside the United States; an agreement with Coherus Biosciences, Inc. (Coherus) for the development and commercialization of a biosimilar to ENBREL ® (etanercept) in Europe, Canada, Brazil and other markets outside the United States along with first refusal rights for other biosimilars under development; an agreement with CTI BioPharma Corp. (f/k/a Cell Therapeutics, Inc.) (CTI BioPharma) for the development and commercialization of pacritinib for all indications including the treatment of myelofibrosis and acute myeloid leukemia; and an agreement with Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta) for the development and commercialization of biosimilars. The company recorded R&D expenses associated with upfront and milestone payments to collaboration partners of $217 million, $78 million, and $113 million during 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and $25 million during the three months ended March 31, 2014. There were no R&D expenses associated with upfront and milestone payments during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Refer to Note 4 to the audited combined financial statements for additional details on the companys significant collaborative arrangements. As part of its strategy to further develop its pipeline, Baxalta also makes equity investments in companies developing high-potential technologies to accelerate innovation and growth for the company. Baxalta has also acquired several companies in recent years with R&D projects that align with Baxaltas therapeutic areas of focus. In 2015, the company acquired SuppreMol GmbH for consideration of $228 million, obtaining its early-stage research programs related to treatment options for autoimmune and allergic diseases. In 2014, the company acquired AesRx, LLC (AesRx) for consideration of $80 million, obtaining AesRxs research 48 Table of Contents program for sickle cell disease treatments. Also in 2014, Baxalta acquired Chatham Therapeutics, Inc. (Chatham) for consideration of $147 million, obtaining its gene therapy programs related to treatments of hemophilia. In September 2014, the company announced it was forming a new global innovation and R&D center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which positions the company to accelerate innovation by building on its pipeline in core areas of expertise, strengthen and build upon R&D collaborations with partners in new and emerging biotechnology areas, and optimize R&D productivity while enhancing patient care globally. The companys R&D pipeline includes projects in the preclinical or exploratory phase through late-stage clinical trials or pending regulatory approval. The following are several key projects currently in late-stage clinical trials or pending regulatory approval:  BAX 111: a recombinant therapy providing a pure von Willebrand disease factor with customized dosing. Baxalta filed for approval in the United States in December 2014 based on positive results in a clinical trial involving on-demand therapy for patients with severe von Willebrand disease.  BAX 817: a recombinant factor VIIa for the treatment of acute bleeding episodes in hemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors. In March 2015, the company announced positive results from its Phase III clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of BAX 817.  BAX 855: an investigational, extended half-life, recombinant factor VIII treatment for hemophilia A. The company submitted for regulatory approval in the United States in December 2014 and in Japan in April 2015.  CHS-0214/BAX 2200: a biosimilar to ENBREL ® (etanercept) that is indicated for the treatment of autoimmune deficiencies in Europe, Canada, Brazil and other markets. This is Baxaltas most advanced biosimilar, currently in Phase III clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, and in early stage clinical trials has demonstrated pharmacokinetic (PK) equivalence versus the innovator molecule. This program is part of a collaboration agreement with Coherus.  20% GAMMAGARD LIQUID SubQ: a higher-potency immunoglobulin therapy offering patients faster infusions with less volume. The company has completed Phase III enrollment in the European Union and the United States, and filed for approval in Europe in May 2015.  nal-IRI (MM-398): an investigational drug candidate for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treated with a gemcitabine-based therapy. A Phase III trial has been completed, and Baxalta filed for approval in the European Union in May 2015 for second-line pancreatic cancer. This program is part of a collaboration agreement with Merrimack. In November 2014, FDA granted nal-IRI (MM-398) Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who have been previously treated with gemcitabine-based therapy.  Pacritinib (BAX 2201): a novel investigational JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor that recently completed Phase III clinical trials for its primary indication, the treatment of myelofibrosis, a chronic, malignant bone marrow disorder. This program is part of a collaboration agreement with CTI BioPharma. Positive top-line results from the Phase III trials were announced in March 2015. The company also incurs R&D expenses in support of regulatory filings, lifecycle management activities on existing products, and on infrastructure and management of the companys overall research and development initiatives. Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations Separation from Baxter The company has not previously operated as an independent, standalone company, but rather as a part of a larger group of companies controlled by Baxter. There are limitations inherent in the preparation of all carve-out 49 Table of Contents financial statements due to the fact that the companys business was previously part of a larger organization. The basis of preparation included in the combined financial statements provides a detailed description of the treatment of historical transactions. The companys net income has been most notably impacted by the following consequences of carve-out accounting and the planned separation:  Baxter utilizes a centralized treasury management system and cash or debt was not allocated to Baxalta in the carve-out financial statements. In connection with the separation, the capital structures of both companies will be re-aligned on or before the distribution date, resulting in Baxalta incurring debt and having adequate cash to fund its operations. The indebtedness will cause Baxalta to record interest expense in future periods. Any additional borrowings entered into in the future will increase interest expense.  The combined statements of income include an allocation to the company from Baxter for the services provided by various Baxter functions including, but not limited to, executive oversight, treasury, finance, legal, human resources, tax planning, internal audit, financial reporting, information technology and investor relations. The amounts of these allocations may not necessarily be indicative of the similar costs the company will incur as an independent, standalone company. The total amount allocated to Baxalta from Baxter was $538 million, $596 million, and $594 million, in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $132 million and $130 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The company has incurred certain one-time separation costs, which are primarily associated with the design and establishment of Baxalta as a standalone public company. Included in results of operations are pre-tax separation costs of $56 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 and $43 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015. The company expects to incur additional separation costs both before and after the separation, certain of which may be capitalized in relation to operating infrastructure such as information technology.  Income tax expense is computed on a separate company basis, as if operated as a standalone entity or a separate entity or a separate consolidated group in each material jurisdiction in which the company operates. As a result of potential changes to the companys business model and potential future tax planning, income tax expense included in the combined financial statements may not be indicative of the companys future expected tax rate.  Concurrent with the separation, Baxalta will enter into a contract manufacturing agreement with Baxter whereby Baxalta and Baxter will produce certain products for one another at agreed upon terms. As products were historically transferred at cost between Baxter and the businesses that comprise Baxalta, these contract manufacturing agreements will result in changes to both sales and cost of goods sold in future periods. Discontinued Operations The company completed the divestiture of its commercial vaccines business in 2014 and recorded an after-tax gain of $417 million, which is reported in income from discontinued operations. The company entered into a separate agreement to sell the remainder of the vaccines business, which includes certain R&D programs, in December 2014. The operating results of the vaccines business have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Refer to Note 17 to the combined financial statements and Note 13 to the condensed combined interim financial statements for additional information regarding the presentation of the vaccines business. Unless otherwise stated, financial results discussed herein reflect continuing operations. 50 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThree Months Ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 Special Items The following table provides a summary of the companys special items and the related impact by line item on the companys results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. Three months ended March 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 Gross Margin Intangible asset amortization expense $ (8 ) $ (3 ) Business optimization items  (2 ) Total Special Items $ (8 ) $ (5 ) Impact on Gross Margin Ratio (0.6 pts ) (0.4 pts ) Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Plasma related litigation $  $ (10 ) Business optimization items 1 (1 )  Separation costs 36  Total Special Items $ 35 $ (10 ) Impact on Selling, General and Administrative Expense Ratio 2.6 pts (0.8 pts ) Research and Development Expenses Business optimization items 1 $ (6 ) $ 6 Upfront and milestone payments to collaboration partners  25 Separation costs 7  Total Special Items $ 1 $ 31 Income Tax Expense Impact of special items $ (11 ) $ (2 ) Total Special Items $ (11 ) $ (2 ) Impact on Effective Tax Rate (0.8 pts ) 0.9 pts Total Special Items, net of tax $ 33 $ 24 1 Includes a portion allocated from Baxter related to shared activities or functions. Intangible asset amortization expense is identified as a special item to facilitate an evaluation of current and past operating performance, particularly in terms of cash returns, and is similar to how management internally assesses performance. Upfront and milestone payments related to collaborations that have been expensed as R&D are uncertain and often result in a different payment and expense recognition pattern than internal R&D activities and therefore are typically treated as special items. Refer to the Research and Development Expenses caption below for additional information regarding the companys upfront and milestone payments to collaboration partners. Additional special items are identified above because they are highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the companys reported operations for a period. The special items identified in the periods presented above reflect the portions of special items reported by Baxter that were attributable to Baxalta. Management believes that providing the separate impact of the above items on the companys GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) results, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP, may provide a more complete understanding of the companys operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the companys results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. 51 Table of Contents The companys results in the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 were impacted by costs associated with the companys execution of certain strategies to optimize its organizational structure, as well as benefits from adjustments to previous estimates. The company recorded a net pre-tax benefit related to business optimization initiatives, including a portion allocated from Baxter related to shared functions or activities, of $7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and a net charge of $8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2014. The business optimization items impacted R&D expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and R&D expenses and cost of sales during the three month period ending March 31, 2014. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the company recorded $43 million of separation costs related to expenses incurred to prepare Baxalta to operate as an independent standalone public company within selling, general and administrative expenses and R&D expenses. During the three months ended March 31, 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses included a $10 million benefit for the reversal of a portion of legal related charges, previously recorded in 2013, following the settlement of class-action litigation associated with pricing of plasma-derived therapies. Income tax expense in both periods included the net tax benefit from the special pre-tax items discussed above. Net Sales Percent change Three months ended March 31 At actual currency rates At constant currency rates (in millions) 2015 2014 United States $ 755 $ 706 7 % 7 % International 606 623 (3 %) 10 % Total net sales $ 1,361 $ 1,329 2 % 8 % Foreign currency unfavorably impacted net sales by six percentage points during the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the prior period principally due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro as well as certain other currencies. The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior years foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current period. The company believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net sales at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net sales at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the companys operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the companys results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. 52 Table of Contents The table below presents sales results for Baxaltas four product categories. The commentary beneath discusses growth drivers at constant currency rates. Percent change Three months ended March 31 At actual currency rates At constant currency rates (in millions) 2015 2014 Hemophilia United States $ 305 $ 297 3 % 3 % International 336 378 (11 %) 1 % Total $ 641 $ 675 (5 %) 2 % Immunoglobulin United States $ 328 $ 307 7 % 7 % International 92 91 1 % 15 % Total $ 420 $ 398 6 % 9 % Inhibitors United States $ 63 $ 44 43 % 43 % International 103 108 (5 %) 8 % Total $ 166 $ 152 9 % 18 % BioTherapeutics United States $ 59 $ 58 2 % 2 % International 75 46 63 % 78 % Total $ 134 $ 104 29 % 36 % Total net sales $ 1,361 $ 1,329 2 % 8 % Hemophilia includes sales of recombinant and plasma-derived hemophilia products (primarily factor VIII and factor IX).  Net sales growth was driven primarily by increased international demand for the companys recombinant factor VIII therapy, ADVATE, including the impact of new multi-year tender awards in Australia and the U.K. Also contributing was increased prophylactic use of ADVATE in the United States and continued growth of RIXUBIS, which the company launched in 2013. Globally, ADVATE contributed approximately 3 percentage points to the Hemophilia product categorys net sales growth rate. Partially offsetting during the period was the impact of a reimbursement assistance program recently implemented in the United States, which unfavorably impacted pricing, competition from an extended half-life factor VIII therapy in the United States, and lower volumes of plasma-derived therapies. Globally, plasma-derived therapies negatively impacted the Hemophilia net sales growth rate by approximately 2 percentage points and was largely driven by the timing of certain tenders. The company expects growth in the Hemophilia product category in 2015 to continue to be impacted by competition from new entrants, including the competitive extended half-life recombinant factor VIII therapy launched in the United States during 2014. The company submitted a Biologics License Application for BAX 855, the companys own investigational extended half-life factor VIII treatment for hemophilia A, to FDA in the fourth quarter of 2014 following positive topline results from the phase III clinical trial. In addition, the company expects long-term growth in the Hemophilia product category, driven by strong underlying global demand, further penetration in markets outside the United States, the new multi-year tenders, and the launch of new therapies in the coming months and years across a variety of geographies, including BAX 855. 53 Table of Contents Immunoglobulin Therapies includes sales of the companys antibody-replacement immunoglobulin therapies.  Net sales growth was driven by increased global demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID, as well as the launch of HYQVIA, the companys differentiated immunoglobulin therapy, in the United States in late 2014. International sales growth of GAMMAGARD LIQUID was driven by increased supply and continued penetration into certain markets while growth in the United States included both volume and pricing improvements. Globally, GAMMAGARD LIQUID and HYQVIA contributed approximately 7 and 2 percentage points, respectively, to the Immunoglobulin Therapies net sales growth rate. To support expected long-term demand for the companys immunoglobulin therapies, including HYQVIA, Baxalta is expanding its capacity across its network, including a manufacturing services agreement with Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation of the Netherlands and construction of a new manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia. Inhibitor Therapies include sales of the companys products to treat patients with congenital hemophilia A or B who have developed inhibitors as well as patients that have developed acquired hemophilia A due to an inhibitor.  Growth in net sales was driven by strong global demand for the companys plasma-based inhibitor bypass therapy, FEIBA. Continued advancement in prophylactic use and pricing improvements contributed to the strong growth in the United States, while penetration into emerging markets drove international growth. Globally, FEIBA contributed approximately 13 percentage points to the Inhibitor Therapies net sales growth rate. The late 2014 U.S. launch of OBIZUR, a recombinant porcine factor VIII therapy for the treatment of acquired Hemophilia A, also contributed to the product categorys net sales growth during the period. BioTherapeutics includes sales of the companys plasma-based therapies to treat alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, burns and shock, and other chronic and acute blood-related conditions.  Net sales increased primarily due to strong demand for the companys albumin therapies, including increased volumes in China as the company previously resolved licensure delays that impacted shipments in the first quarter of 2014. Globally, the companys albumin products contributed 26 percentage points to the BioTherapeutics product categorys net sales growth rate. Also contributing were revenues recorded from a contract manufacturing agreement related to the divested commercial vaccines business, which contributed approximately 8 percentage points to the product categorys net sales growth rate. Expenses and Expense Ratios Three months ended March 31 (as a percent of net sales) 2015 2014 Change Gross margin 58.0 % 57.9 % 0.1 pts Selling, general and administrative expense ratio 20.8 % 16.7 % 4.1 pts Gross Margin The special items identified above had an unfavorable impact of 0.6 and 0.4 percentage points on the gross margin percentage during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Refer to the Special Items caption above for additional details. Excluding the impact of special items, gross margin percentage increased modestly during the three months ended March 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by sales growth and pricing 54 Table of Contents improvements for FEIBA and a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Partially offsetting were higher manufacturing costs for plasma-derived products, including increased production in the Companys Los Angeles fractionation facility and timing of a planned temporary facility shutdown. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The special items identified above had an unfavorable impact of 2.6 percentage points and a favorable impact of 0.8 percentage points on the selling, general and administrative expense ratio during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Refer to the Special Items caption above for additional detail. Excluding the impact of the special items from both periods, the selling, general and administrative expense ratio increased during the three months ended March 31, 2015 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2014. Leverage from higher sales was more than offset by investments to support international operations and marketing initiatives related to new product launches. Following the separation, the composition of Baxaltas selling, general and administrative expenses will change. The company will no longer receive an allocation of costs from Baxter associated with certain corporate or other functions and will incur costs associated with operating as a standalone public company. As a result, selling, general and administrative expenses and the selling, general and administrative expense ratio included in or calculated from the companys results of operations prior to the separation may not be indicative of the companys expenses or ratio following the separation. Refer to Note 12 to the unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements for additional information regarding allocated costs from Baxter. Business Optimization Items The company has implemented certain business optimization initiatives in an effort to streamline its international operations, rationalize its manufacturing facilities, enhance its general and administrative infrastructure and re-align or cancel certain R&D activities and programs. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the company recorded charges of $3 million allocated from Baxter and benefits of $10 million resulting from adjustments to previous estimates. The company does not expect a material amount of savings associated with charges recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2015. The company estimates that business optimization activities from 2012 through 2014 have resulted in total annualized savings of approximately $60 million as of March 31, 2015. The company expects additional annualized savings of $19 million when the programs are fully implemented in 2016. The savings from these actions impact cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and R&D expenses. Refer to Note 6 to the combined financial statements and Note 5 to the unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements for further information regarding business optimization items. Research and Development Expenses Three months ended March 31 (in millions) 2015 2014 Percent change Discovery, clinical and lifecycle management $ 99 $ 81 22 % Upfront and milestone payments to collaboration partners  25 N/M Other research and development expenses 57 57  % Total research and development expenses $ 156 $ 163 (4 %) Discovery, clinical and lifecycle management R&D expenses consist of costs supporting specific R&D projects, including those in the exploratory or preclinical phase, those in early-or late-stage clinical trials, as well 55 Table of Contents as those pending regulatory approval or supporting development of products that have already obtained regulatory approval. The increase in discovery, clinical and lifecycle management R&D expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2015 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2014 was driven by an increase in costs supporting the development of biosimilars and oncology products, as well as an increase in costs supporting the regulatory approval process for BAX855. Partially offsetting was the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Upfront and milestone payments to collaboration partners in the three months ended March 31, 2014 of $25 million consisted of payments to Coherus related to the development of a biosimilar to ENBREL ® (etanercept). Other research and development expenses include costs not directly attributable to individual projects and include depreciation and other facility-based expenses, medical and regulatory affairs functions, pharmacovigilance, other infrastructure and management costs supporting multiple projects, business optimization items, and separation costs. Other research and development expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2015 included a benefit of $6 million for adjustments to estimates of prior period business optimization charges and separation costs of $7 million. Other research and development expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2014 included business optimization charges of $6 million. Excluding the impact of business optimization items and separation costs, other research and development expenses increased during the three months ended March 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year due primarily to investments the company made in its medical affairs function. Other (Expense) Income, Net Other (expense) income, net was $12 million of expense during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and $23 million of income during the three months ended March 31, 2014. Included in other (expense) income, net during the three months ended March 31, 2015 was other-than-temporary impairment charges of $9 million based on the duration of declines in the fair value of two of the companys investments. Other (expense) income, net during the three months ended March 31, 2014 included equity method investment income of $25 million. Income Taxes Effective Income Tax Rate The companys effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 22.7% and 24.3% during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The companys effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate each year due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives, state and local taxes, and foreign taxes that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. In addition, the effective tax rate can be impacted each period by discrete factors and events. The effective income tax rate decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2015 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2014 primarily due to R&D charges associated with milestone payments made to collaboration partners during the three months ended March 31, 2014 that were deductible at tax rates lower than the effective tax rate and separation costs incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2015 that were deductible at tax rates higher than the effective rate. Additionally, during the three months ended March 31, 2015, the company favorably resolved certain miscellaneous tax contingent liabilities. 56 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYears Ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 Special Items The following table provides a summary of the companys special items and the related impact by line item on the companys results of operations for 2014, 2013, and 2012. years ended December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 Gross Margin Intangible asset amortization expense $ (16 ) $ (16 ) $ (16) Business optimization items 1 (1 ) (5 ) (19) Total Special Items $ (17 ) $ (21 ) $ (35) Impact on Gross Margin Ratio (0.3 pts ) (0.4 pts ) (0.7 pts) Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Plasma related litigation $ (10 ) $ 84 $  Business optimization items 1  16 16 Separation costs 43   Branded Prescription Drug Fee 26   Turkey VAT charge  8  Pension settlement charge allocated from Baxter   72 Total Special Items $ 59 $ 108 $ 88 Impact on Selling, General and Administrative Expense Ratio 1.0 pts 1.9 pts 1.7 pts Research and Development Expenses Business optimization items 1 $ 21 $ 24 $ 16 Upfront and milestone payments to collaboration partners 217 78 113 Separation costs 13   Total Special Items $ 251 $ 102 $ 129 Other Expense, Net Change in fair value of contingent payment liabilities $ 124 $ 18 $  Other-than-temporary impairment charge 45   Total Special Items $ 169 $ 18 $  Income Tax Expense Impact of special items $ (97 ) $ (105 ) $ (67) Total Special Items $ (97 ) $ (105 ) $ (67) Impact on Effective Tax Rate 0.7 pts (2.9 pts ) (0.5 pts) Total Special Items, net of tax $ 399 $ 144 $ 185 1 Includes a portion allocated from Baxter related to shared activities or functions. Refer to the Special Items caption in the Results of OperationsThree Months Ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 section for further discussion regarding the reasons for providing separate impact of intangible amortization expense, upfront and milestone payments to collaboration partners and other items above. The companys results in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were impacted by costs associated with the companys execution of certain strategies to optimize its organizational structure. These actions included streamlining the companys international operations, rationalizing its manufacturing facilities, improving its general and administrative infrastructure, and re-aligning or cancelling certain R&D activities and programs. The company recorded net pre-tax charges related to business optimization initiatives, including a portion allocated from 57 Table of Contents Baxter, of $22 million, $45 million, and $51 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, which impacted cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and R&D expenses. The 2014 net business optimization charge included adjustments of $12 million, including a portion allocated from Baxter, for reserves that are no longer probable of being utilized. The company recorded legal related charges in selling, general and administrative expenses during 2013 totaling $84 million for class-action litigation associated with pricing of plasma-derived therapies, $10 million of which was reversed in 2014 following the settlement of the plasma-related litigation. The company recorded losses in other expense, net of $124 million in 2014 and $18 million in 2013 resulting from increases in the fair value of a contingent payment liability associated with the acquisition of OBIZUR and related assets from Inspiration BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. and Ipsen Pharma S.A.S. (Inspiration / Ipsen). In 2014, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and R&D expenses included separation costs totaling $56 million related to expenses incurred to prepare Baxalta to operate as an independent, standalone public company. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2014 also included a charge of $26 million to account for an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee in accordance with final regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service. Other expense, net in 2014 included a $45 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write-down the companys investment in the common stock of Onconova Therapeutics, Inc. (Onconova) to its fair value. In 2013, selling, general and administrative expenses included an $8 million charge related to VAT matters in Turkey. In 2012, the company recorded charges within selling, general and administrative expenses of $72 million related to pension settlements in the United States that were allocated from Baxter. Income tax expense in 2014, 2013 and 2012 included the net tax benefit from the special pre-tax items discussed above. In addition, income tax expense in 2013 included a benefit of $34 million related to the reversal of accruals for uncertain tax positions in Switzerland.

Foreign currency fluctuations did not have a significant impact on the 2013 net sales growth rate as compared to 2012 as the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro was offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to the Japanese Yen. Refer to the Net Sales caption in the Results of OperationsThree Months Ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 section for a description of net sales growth at constant currency rates and reasons for use of this non-GAAP measure. 58 Table of Contents The table below presents sales results for Baxaltas four product categories. The commentary beneath discusses growth drivers at constant currency rates.

Globally, growth in ADVATE contributed approximately 8 percentage points and 6 percentage points to the Hemophilia net sales growth rate in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Additionally, the launch of RIXUBIS in late 2013 contributed approximately 1 percentage point to the 2014 Hemophilia growth rate. Immunoglobulin Therapies includes sales of the companys antibody-replacement immunoglobulin therapies.  Sales increased in 2014 primarily due to increased demand in the United States for GAMMAGARD LIQUID and continued penetration into certain emerging markets, partially offset by lower net pricing in the United States due to shifts in channel mix and increased customer incentives. Globally, GAMMAGARD LIQUID contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the Immunoglobulin Therapies growth rate in 2014. HYQVIA, a differentiated subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency syndrome, was launched in the United States in the second half of 2014 and contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the 2014 growth rate. In 2013, sales increased primarily due to improved product availability and accelerated demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID, particularly in the United States. Sales growth in 2013 was partially offset by lower international sales as a result of the impact from exiting certain markets due to previous supply constraints. Globally, GAMMAGARD LIQUID contributed 3 percentage points to the Immunoglobulin Therapies growth rate in 2013. 59 Table of Contents Inhibitor Therapies include sales of the companys products to treat patients with congenital hemophilia A or B who have developed inhibitors as well as patients that have developed acquired hemophilia A due to an inhibitor.  Sales growth in 2014 was driven by strong global demand for the companys plasma-based inhibitor bypass therapy, FEIBA. Strong demand in the United States was due in part to increased prophylactic use, which was approved by FDA in late 2013. International sales growth was driven by continued prophylactic use and continued penetration into emerging markets. Sales growth in 2013 was primarily due to higher volumes in Europe driven in part from increased prophylactic use, as well as increased volumes in the United States. FEIBA contributed nearly all of the 15 percentage points and 7 percentage points of Inhibitor Therapies net sales growth rate in 2014 and 2013, respectively. BioTherapeutics includes sales of the companys plasma-based therapies to treat alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, burns and shock, and other chronic and acute blood-related conditions.  Sales increased during 2014 primarily due to increased demand for the companys albumin products within the United States and several emerging markets. Partially offsetting was lower albumin sales in China due to licensure delays that impacted shipments in the first half of 2014. Globally, albumin products contributed 10 percentage points to the BioTherapeutics net sales growth rate in 2014. In 2013, sales growth was primarily due to improved product availability and accelerated demand of albumin and Alpha-1 treatments in the United States. Expenses and Expense Ratios Change years ended December 31 (as a percent of net sales) 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 Gross margin 59.0% 58.1% 57.8% 0.9 pts 0.3 pts Selling, general and administrative expense ratio 17.7% 18.3% 17.2% (0.6 pts) 1.1 pts Gross Margin The special items identified above had an unfavorable impact of 0.3, 0.4 and 0.7 percentage points on the gross margin percentage in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Refer to the Special Items caption above for additional details. Excluding the impact of the special items, gross margin percentage improved in 2014 as compared to 2013 driven by growth in higher margin products, including ADVATE and FEIBA, and lower pension expense allocated from Baxter partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of the special items, the gross margin percentage in 2013 was unchanged compared to 2012. Growth in higher margin products, including ADVATE and FEIBA, was offset by government austerity measures that negatively impacted selling prices of certain products in select markets, the realization of additional costs associated with the modification and ramp-up of production at the companys Los Angeles fractionation facilities and the impact of increased pension expense allocated from Baxter. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The special items identified above had an unfavorable impact of 1.0, 1.9 and 1.7 percentage points on the selling, general and administrative expense ratio in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Refer to the Special Items caption above for additional detail. Excluding the impact of the special items, the selling, general and administrative expense ratio increased in 2014 compared to 2013 and in 2013 compared to 2012. Select investments and spending on marketing and promotional programs for new launches and initiatives were the primary drivers in both periods. Partially 60 Table of Contents offsetting in both periods was leverage from higher sales, savings from the companys business optimization initiatives and continued focus on controlling discretionary spending. Pension expense allocated from Baxter had a favorable impact in 2014 as compared to 2013 and an unfavorable impact in 2013 as compared to 2012. Following the separation, the composition of Baxaltas selling, general and administrative expenses will change. The company will no longer receive an allocation of costs from Baxter associated with certain corporate or other functions and will incur costs associated with operating as a standalone public company. As a result, selling, general and administrative expenses and the selling, general and administrative expense ratio included in or calculated from the companys results of operations prior to the separation may not be indicative of the companys expenses or ratio following the separation. Refer to Note 16 to the combined financial statements for additional information regarding allocated costs from Baxter. Pension Plan Costs For pension plans in Austria, Baxalta has been deemed to be the sole sponsor. Within the United States and other countries, Baxalta employees participate in pension plans sponsored by Baxter. Baxalta records pension expense related to its employees that participate in any of these plans. Baxaltas results of operations also include an allocation from Baxter, which includes pension costs associated with corporate, shared, or inactive employees. In aggregate, excluding the impact of U.S. pension obligation settlement charges in 2012 allocated from Baxter, costs associated with pension plans decreased $33 million in 2014 and increased $23 million in 2013. The decrease in 2014 as compared to 2013 was driven by a decrease in amortization of actuarial losses. The increase in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily driven by lower interest rates used to discount the plans projected benefit obligations and an increase in amortization of actuarial losses. Business Optimization Items The company has implemented certain business optimization initiatives in an effort to streamline its international operations, rationalize its manufacturing facilities, enhance its general and administrative infrastructure and re-align or cancel certain R&D activities and programs. In 2014, the company recorded net business optimization charges from continuing operations of $22 million. The net business optimization charges in 2014 included $12 million of adjustments for reserves that are no longer probable of being utilized, including a portion allocated from Baxter. The savings from these actions will impact primarily cost of sales. The company expects annualized savings of approximately $7 million when these programs are fully implemented in 2016. The company has previously recognized business optimization charges of $45 million and $51 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, associated with initiatives that the company estimates have resulted in annualized savings of approximately $51 million as of December 31, 2014. The company expects additional annualized savings of approximately $21 million when these programs are fully implemented in 2016. The savings from these actions impact cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and R&D expenses. Refer to Note 6 to the combined financial statements for further information regarding business optimization items. Research and Development Expenses Percent change years ended December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 Discovery, clinical and lifecycle management $ 340 $ 289 $ 261 18 % 11% Upfront and milestone payments to collaboration partners 217 78 113 178 % (31%) Other research and development expenses 263 228 207 15 % 10% Total research and development expenses $ 820 $ 595 $ 581 38 % 2% 61 Table of Contents Discovery, clinical and lifecycle management R&D expenses consist of costs supporting specific R&D projects, including those in the exploratory or preclinical phase, those in early-or late-stage clinical trials, as well as those pending regulatory approval or supporting development of products that have already obtained regulatory approval. The increase in discovery, clinical and lifecycle management R&D expenses in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in expenses supporting the development of BAX855, the companys extended half-life recombinant factor VIII therapy for Hemophilia A which was submitted for regulatory approval in the United States in December 2014, and biosimilars. Partially offsetting were lower expenses associated with the companys Alzheimers program, which was suspended in 2013 following a Phase III trial which did not meet its primary endpoint. The increase in discovery, clinical and lifecycle management R&D expenses in 2013 as compared to 2012 was driven by an increase in expenses supporting the development of BAX 855, biosimilars and OBIZUR, as well as an increase in expenses supporting continued development of marketed products. OBIZUR was approved and launched in the United States in 2014. Partially offsetting was lower expenses associated with the companys Alzheimers program. Upfront and milestone payments to collaboration partners in 2014 of $217 million consisted of payments to Merrimack related to the development of MM-398, a pancreatic cancer drug candidate, to Coherus related to the development of a biosimilar to ENBREL ® (etanercept), to CTI BioPharma related to the development of pacritinib, and to Momenta related to the development of biosimilars. Upfront and milestone payments to collaboration partners in 2013 of $78 million consisted primarily of payments to Coherus and CTI BioPharma. Upfront and milestone payments to collaboration partners in 2012 of $113 million consisted of payments to Chatham related to the development of potential treatments for hemophilia utilizing proprietary gene therapy technology, to Onconova related to the development of rigosertib, and to Momenta. Other research and development expenses include costs not directly attributable to individual projects and include depreciation and other facility-based expenses, medical and regulatory affairs functions, pharmacovigilance, other infrastructure and management costs supporting multiple projects, business optimization charges, and separation costs. Business optimization charges reported in R&D expenses were $21 million in 2014, $24 million in 2013, and $16 million in 2012 as further discussed above under the Business Optimization Items caption. Separation costs reported in R&D expenses were $13 million in 2014. Excluding the impact of business optimization charges and separation costs, other research and development expenses increased in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to investments the company made in its medical affairs function. In 2013 as compared to 2012, other research and development expenses increased in support of a number of key projects in the companys R&D pipeline and geographic expansion. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net was $104 million in 2014, $1 million in 2013, and $15 million in 2012. During 2014 and 2013, other expense, net included losses of $124 million and $18 million, respectively, resulting from increases in the fair value of a contingent payment liability associated with the acquisition of OBIZUR and related assets from Inspiration / Ipsen. Other expense, net also included income from equity method investments of $64 million and $23 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, which primarily represented distributions from funds that sold portfolio companies as well as gains from the sale of certain investments. Also included in other expense, net during 2014 was a $45 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write-down the companys investment in the common stock of Onconova to its fair value. Income Taxes Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate was 22.6% in 2014, 20.1% in 2013, and 22.8% in 2012. The companys effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate each year due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives, state and local taxes and foreign taxes that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. The average foreign effective tax rate on international pre-tax income was 5.4%, 5.3%, and 7.8% for the years ended 62 Table of Contents December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The companys average foreign effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate as a result of the impact of tax incentives in Switzerland and certain other tax jurisdictions outside of the United States, as well as foreign earnings in tax jurisdictions with lower statutory rates than the United States. In addition, as discussed further below, the companys effective income tax rate can be impacted in each year by discrete factors or events. Refer to Note 13 to the combined financial statements for further information regarding the companys income taxes. The companys effective income tax rate in 2014 increased as compared to 2013 due primarily to an increase in the companys annual fee on Branded Prescription Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers and Importers, which is not deductible for federal income tax purposes, a change to the earnings mix from lower tax to higher tax rate jurisdictions, and a reduction in uncertain tax position benefits. The companys effective income tax rate in 2013 decreased as compared to 2012 due primarily to the reduction of uncertain tax positions for matters that have been settled by the taxing authorities as well as a law change allowing for a credit for research and experimental activities which previously expired in 2012. Partially offsetting was a change to the earnings mix from lower tax to higher tax rate jurisdictions compared to the prior year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Baxalta has historically participated in Baxters centralized treasury management including centralized cash pooling and overall financing arrangements. Baxalta has generated and expects to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations on an annual basis. Net cash provided from (used for) financing activities in the historical periods primarily reflects changes in Baxters investment in Baxalta. Baxalta has not reported cash or cash equivalents on its balance sheet for the periods presented due to its participation in Baxters centralized treasury management. Subsequent to the separation, Baxalta will no longer participate in cash management and funding arrangements with Baxter. Baxaltas ability to fund its operations and capital needs will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets, as further described under the Debt and Capital caption below. Baxaltas principal uses of cash in the future will be primarily to fund its operations, working capital needs, capital expenditures, repayment of borrowings and strategic investments. A significant portion of the companys net cash from operations is generated within the United States, allowing the company to indefinitely reinvest a portion of its foreign earnings in jurisdictions outside of the United States. The company believes its U.S. cash flows from operations together with repatriations of foreign earnings that are not deemed permanently invested are adequate to meet its ongoing cash flow obligations in the United States. Debt and Capital Baxalta issued $5 billion of debt in advance of the separation, of which approximately $4 billion was paid to Baxter as a cash distribution as partial consideration for the contribution of assets to Baxalta by Baxter in connection with the separation. Following the debt issuance, cash distribution to Baxter and cash contributed from Baxter in connection with the formation of various Baxalta entities, Baxalta expects to begin operations as an independent company with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents. The company believes that its financing arrangements described above, future cash from operations, and access to capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund its future cash flow needs. Refer to the Description of Material Indebtedness section of this prospectus for further details on the companys expected financing arrangements. 63 Table of Contents Historical Cash Flow Trends Three months ended March 31, Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 2014 2013 2012 Net cash (used for) provided from operations $ (142 ) $ (168 ) $ 1,373 $ 1,548 $ 1,408 Net cash used for investing activities (547 ) (206 ) (501 ) (977 ) (697 ) Net cash provided from (used for) financing activities 689 374 (872 ) (571 ) (711 ) Change in cash and cash equivalents $  $  $  $  $  Net Cash (Used For) Provided From Operations The decrease in net cash used for operations during the first three months of 2015 as compared to 2014 was driven by lower cash outflows for tax related items partially offset by significant accounts receivable collections in the United States and certain international markets during the first three months of 2014 and lower net income during the first three months of 2015. The company maintains an income taxes payable to/from account with Baxter, and is deemed to have settled its current income tax payables with Baxter annually on the first day of each year. This results in significant tax related cash outflows during the first three months of each year that are not repeated during the last nine months of each year. This annual settlement resulted in cash outflows of $352 million and $537 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which reflected the full prior years current income tax expense and other current tax balances. Net cash provided from operations decreased in 2014 as compared to 2013 as the impact of sales growth was more than offset primarily by an increase in tax-related items, increased payments to collaboration partners upon the achievement of R&D related milestones, and the settlement of the companys plasma-related litigation in 2014. Net cash provided from operations increased by $140 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 2012. The growth in net cash provided from operations was driven primarily by growth in the companys sales and operating results. Net Cash Used For Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities increased during the three months ended March 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year period due primarily to the acquisition of SuppreMol during the current year period and an increase in capital expenditures. The companys net cash used for investing activities decreased in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to a cash inflow of $639 million from the sale of the commercial vaccines business partially offset by a $173 million increase in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures drove the increase in cash used for investing activities in 2013 as compared to 2012. Capital expenditures during the first three months of 2015 and 2014 were $301 million and $219 million, respectively, and $970 million, $797 million and $521 million, in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in the first three months of 2015 as compared to the first three months of 2014 was driven by increased costs for the construction of the companys Covington, Georgia manufacturing facility as the company continues to progress towards completion. A significant portion of the construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2015 and commercial production is expected to begin in 2018. Capital expenditures associated with the Covington, Georgia facility also drove the increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 and in 2013 as compared to 2012. Also contributing to the increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 was construction of a manufacturing facility in Singapore, which began commercial production of ADVATE in 2014. The company expects to continue investing in the Singapore facility to add capacity for other products, including BAX855 upon regulatory approval. 64 Table of Contents Cash outflows for acquisitions, net of cash acquired during the first three months of 2015 was $228 million and reflected the consideration paid for the acquisition of SuppreMol. The company did not have any cash outflows for acquisitions during the three months ended March 31, 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, cash outflows for acquisitions, net of cash acquired were $197 million, $163 million and $163 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the cash outflows from acquisitions, net of cash acquired included $100 million for an upfront collaboration payment to Merrimack, $70 million for the acquisition of Chatham and $15 million for the acquisition of AesRx. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the cash outflows for acquisitions, net of cash acquired included a payment of $60 million related to a collaboration agreement with and investment in CTI BioPharma, $51 million for the acquisition of OBIZUR and related assets from Inspiration / Ipsen and $30 million related to an upfront payment to Coherus. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash outflows for acquisitions, net of cash acquired primarily included a $50 million investment in and a $50 million upfront collaboration payment to Onconova and upfront collaboration payments of $33 million and $30 million related to agreements with Momenta and Chatham, respectively. Refer to Note 4 to the combined financial statements for additional information regarding the companys acquisitions and collaboration agreements. Net Cash Provided From (Used For) Financing Activities Baxter has historically used a centralized approach to cash management and financing of its operations. As a result, the company has not reported cash and cash equivalents on its combined balance sheets. Net cash provided from (used for) financing activities in all periods presented primarily reflected net transactions with Baxter. Concentrations of Credit Risk Baxalta engages in business with foreign governments in certain countries that have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions, including Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy. As of March 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the companys net accounts receivable from the public sector in these countries totaled $79 million, $88 million and $146 million, respectively. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2014, the company had contractual obligations, excluding accounts payable and accrued liabilities, payable or maturing in the following periods: (in millions) Total Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years Capital lease obligations, including current maturities and interest(a) $ 370 $ 1 $ 40 $ 31 $ 298 Operating leases 218 43 72 45 58 Other long-term liabilities(b) 1,019  89 42 888 Purchase obligations(c) 1,058 426 431 146 55 Contractual obligations $ 2,665 $ 470 $ 632 $ 264 $ 1,299 (a) Interest payments on capital lease obligations are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at the end of 2014. The projected payments only pertain to obligations outstanding at December 31, 2014. (b) Other long-term liabilities include long-term obligations recorded on the companys combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 that are not presented separately within the table above. They include the fair value of contingent payment liabilities associated with acquisitions, deferred tax liabilities and the companys recorded pension obligations. The company projected the timing of the future cash payments of its other long-term liabilities based on contractual maturity dates (where applicable) and estimates of the timing of payments (for liabilities with no contractual maturity dates). The actual timing of payments could differ from the estimates. 65 Table of Contents (c) Includes the companys significant contractual unconditional purchase obligations. For cancelable agreements, any penalty due upon cancellation is included. These commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements and are in the normal course of business. Examples include firm commitments for raw material purchases, utility agreements and service contracts. In addition to amounts in the table above, the company is contractually obligated to pay third parties upon the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as potential royalty payments, associated with its collaboration agreements. The companys obligations associated with these arrangements have not been incurred and as such have not been recorded on the companys combined balance sheet. Potential future milestone payments associated with the companys collaborations was approximately $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2014, which excludes potential royalty payments. Of the potential $2.3 billion, the company anticipates less than $400 million of potential milestone payments will become payable in 2015. Also excluded from the table above is the companys unfunded commitment at December 31, 2014 of $32 million as a limited partner in multiple investment companies, in which the timing of future payments is uncertain. As of March 31, 2015, the company increased this unfunded commitment to $80 million. The long-term liability relating to gross unrecognized tax benefits of $99 million at December 31, 2014 has been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal. In 2015, the company entered into a long-term lease agreement for a facility in Bannockburn, Illinois that will serve as Baxaltas global headquarters following a transition period. The arrangement calls for approximately $65 million in lease payments over an initial term of approximately 13 years. The table above excludes obligations from financing arrangements that the company expects to enter into prior to the separation. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Baxalta periodically enters into off-balance sheet arrangements. Certain contingencies arise in the normal course of business, and are not recorded in the combined balance sheet in accordance with GAAP (such as contingent joint development and commercialization arrangement payments). Also, upon resolution of uncertainties, the company may incur charges in excess of presently established liabilities for certain matters (such as contractual indemnifications). For a discussion of the companys significant off-balance sheet arrangements, refer to Note 4 to the combined financial statements for information regarding collaboration agreements, Note 9 to the combined financial statements regarding indemnifications and Note 14 to the combined financial statements regarding legal contingencies. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Currency Risk Baxalta operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Baxalta is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Swiss Franc, Australian Dollar, Turkish Lira, Russian Ruble, Chinese Renminbi, and Colombian Peso. Baxter maintains a foreign currency risk management program through a central shared entity, which enters into derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency risk associated with forecasted transactions for the entire company, including for Baxaltas operations. Gains and losses on derivative contracts entered into by Baxter have been allocated to Baxalta and offset gains and losses on underlying foreign currency exposures. The fair value of outstanding derivative instruments have not been allocated to Baxaltas combined balance sheets. Following the separation, Baxalta intends to implement a foreign currency risk management program on its own behalf. The company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material to its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 66 Table of Contents Interest Rate and Other Risks Baxaltas combined balance sheets and statements of income do not include an allocation of third-party debt or interest expense from Baxter because Baxalta was not the legal obligor of the debt and because Baxters borrowings were not directly attributable to Baxaltas business. Baxalta issued $5 billion of senior notes prior to the separation, at which time its exposure to interest rate risk increased. To mitigate the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to the anticipated incurrence of debt, the company has entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $1.8 billion as of March 31, 2015 and $550 million as of December 31, 2014. The company has designated these forward-starting swaps as cash flow hedges, and the resulting gain or loss from changes in fair value is accumulated in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged debt. The company performed a sensitivity analysis to assess potential impacts of hypothetical movements in interest rates on the fair value of its forward-starting swaps as of March 31, 2015. The sensitivity analysis, while not predictive in nature, indicated that if interest rates increased by 25 basis points, the net liability, net of tax, with respect to the forward-starting swaps would decrease by $39 million, and result in the contracts being in a net asset position. A similar sensitivity analysis performed as of December 31, 2014, indicated that if interest rates increased by 25 basis points, the net liability, net of tax, with respect to the forward-starting swaps would decrease by $11 million, and result in the contracts being in a net asset position. With respect to the companys investments, the company believes any reasonably possible near-term losses in earnings, cash flows and fair values would not be material to the companys combined financial position. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In April 2014, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity (ASU 2014-08) which amends the definition of a discontinued operation in Accounting Standard Codifications (ASC) 205-20 and provides additional requirements for the entities with its disposal transaction to qualify as a discontinued operation. ASU 2014-08 is effective prospectively for all disposals beginning on or after December 15, 2014 (with early adoption permitted). The company did not early adopt the new guidance and it is effective for the company for periods beginning with its first interim period ending March 31, 2015. ASU 2014-08 did not have a material impact on the companys interim combined financial statements upon adoption. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the company beginning on January 1, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. In April 2015, the FASB issued an exposure draft that would delay the effective date of the standard by one year and allow early adoption as of the original effective date. The company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on its combined financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. A summary of the companys significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the combined financial statements. Certain of the companys accounting policies are considered critical because these policies are the most important to the depiction of the companys financial statements and require significant, difficult or complex judgments by the company, often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results that differ from the companys estimates could have an unfavorable effect on the companys results of 67 Table of Contents operations and financial position. The company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year. The following is a summary of accounting policies that the company considers critical to the combined financial statements. Revenue Recognition and Related Provisions and Allowances The companys policy is to recognize revenues from product sales and services when earned. Specifically, revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred (or services have been rendered), the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. For product sales, revenue is not recognized until title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. The shipping terms for the majority of the companys revenue arrangements are FOB destination. The company periodically and systematically evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts. In determining the amount of the reserve, the company considers historical credit losses, the past-due status of receivables, payment history and other customer-specific information, and any other relevant factors or considerations. Provisions for rebates, chargebacks to wholesalers and distributors, returns, and discounts (collectively, sales deductions) are provided for at the time the related sales are recorded, and are reflected as a reduction of sales. The sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or will be claimed on such sales. The companys most significant and judgmental sales deductions are rebates and wholesaler and distributor chargebacks. Rebates include amounts estimated to be paid to third parties based either on contractual obligations that vary by product or customer or statutory requirements. Contractual rebate obligations are based on units sold, customer inventory levels, forecasted customer buying patterns and historical experience. Contractual rebate obligations are settled up to 15 months after date of sale, and accruals are adjusted throughout the contract period as actual contract performance measures become known. Statutory rebate estimates, which include payments under Medicaid, TRICARE and Medicare Part D reimbursement programs, are generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future utilization based on established formulas or requirements, including the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. All liabilities associated with rebates are reviewed regularly taking into consideration known market events and trends as well as internal and external historical data. The company believes the methodology used to accrue rebates is reasonable and appropriate given the current circumstances and facts. Chargeback provisions are based on the differential of product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and distributors and prices paid by eligible customers under product pricing or customer contractual agreements, and may fluctuate based on channel strategy shifts, inventory levels, and end customer pricing strategies and mix. Such amounts are generally settled within one year of initial shipment. Legal Contingencies The company is involved in product liability, patent, commercial, regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business. The company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no liability is recorded. The company has established reserves for certain of its legal matters. At December 31, 2014, total legal liabilities were $24 million. The companys loss estimates are generally developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of potential outcomes. With respect to the recording of any insurance recoveries, after completing the assessment and accounting for the companys legal contingencies, the company separately and independently 68 Table of Contents analyzes its insurance coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be collected. In performing the assessment, the company reviews available information, including historical company-specific and market collection experience for similar claims, current facts and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim, the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or companies, and other relevant information. While the liability of the company in connection with certain claims cannot be estimated with certainty, and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the companys results of operations and cash flows for that period, the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys combined financial position. While the company believes it has valid defenses in these matters, litigation is inherently uncertain, excessive verdicts do occur, and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowances and Reserves for Uncertain Tax Positions The company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in the companys tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, the company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. The realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future, particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected, or if the company takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary. The company does not currently have any valuation allowances. In the normal course of business, the company is audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The company believes its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, based on the technical support for the positions, the companys past audit experience with similar situations, and potential interest and penalties related to the matters. The companys results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if, upon final resolution with taxing authorities, the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established, or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. Valuation of Intangible Assets, Including IPR&D The company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair value. Valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis, incorporating the stage of completion and consideration of market participant assumptions. The most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows, the assessment of the assets life cycle, and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset, including consideration of technical, legal, regulatory, economic and other factors. Each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D) is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use. Acquired IPR&D included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. If the R&D project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived asset is charged to expense. 69 Table of Contents R&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately. For such transactions, payments made to third parties on or after regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset, and are classified as intangible assets. Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with R&D projects, there is no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to prepare discounted cash flow analyses, nor that the R&D project will result in a successful commercial product. Valuation of Contingent Consideration Resulting from Business Combinations The company recognizes contingent consideration liabilities resulting from business combinations at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. The contingent consideration liabilities are revalued subsequent to the acquisition date with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Contingent payments related to acquisitions consist of development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, in addition to sales-based payments, and are valued using discounted cash flow techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations include the probability of achieving milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the estimated payments. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities result from changes in these estimates and assumptions. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of the estimates and assumptions as of the acquisition date and in post-acquisition periods. Accordingly, the use of alternative estimates or assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, and could materially impact the companys results of operations in any given period. At December 31, 2014 the companys combined balance sheet included $518 million of contingent consideration liabilities resulting from business combinations. Impairment of Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews annually, and whenever indicators of impairment exist. The company tests the goodwill of its single reporting unit in the fourth quarter of each year. No goodwill impairment was recorded in 2014, 2013 or 2012. The results of the 2014 impairment test indicated the fair value of the companys reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value. The company performs a qualitative assessment of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, including IPR&D, at least annually. If the intangible asset is determined to be more likely than not impaired as a result of the assessment, the company completes a quantitative impairment test. Intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets (such as fixed assets) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The companys impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, foreign currency exchange rates, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the companys business plans and a market participants views of the company and similar companies. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair values of the assets, and potentially result in different impacts to the companys results of operations. Actual results may differ from the companys estimates. Pension and Other Postemployment Benefit (OPEB) Plans Baxaltas employees participate in various pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Baxalta accounts for the majority of these plans as multiemployer plans, in which case no liabilities or plan assets are included in the companys combined balance sheets. Within its combined statements of income, Baxalta includes pension expense associated with its employees that participate in the multiemployer plans. Total pre-tax defined benefit plan net expenses included in net income from continuing operations associated with multiemployer plans was $37 million in 2014, $45 million in 2013 and $36 million in 2012. These costs are reflected in cost of sales, R&D expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses. The pension costs were deemed to be funded through intercompany transactions with Baxter and are reflected within the net parent company investment equity balance. 70 Table of Contents For pension plans in Austria, nearly all participants have been determined to be Baxalta employees. Baxalta has concluded these pension plans are multiple-employer plans and has accounted for them as if Baxalta was the sponsor of a single employer plan. The company has included the related liabilities and expenses in its combined financial statements based on actuarial analyses. The plans are unfunded and there are no plan assets. Expenses from continuing operations included in Baxaltas combined statements of income associated with multiple-employer plans were $14 million, $14 million and $9 million, in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Projected and accumulated benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost are calculated using actuarial assumptions including interest rates used to discount the liabilities, rates of increase in employee compensation and other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover. In addition to pension expense associated with Baxaltas employees, the companys results of operations included allocated expenses from Baxter, which considered costs related to pension plans for corporate or shared employees. For several of the pension plans that have been accounted for as a multiemployer plan, Baxalta is expected to receive a net benefit obligation in connection with the separation and record pension plan liabilities and assets when transferred. See Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements for additional information. 71 Table of Contents BUSINESS Overview Baxalta is a global, innovative biopharmaceutical leader with a sustainable portfolio of differentiated therapies that seek to address unmet medical needs across many disease areas, including hemophilia, immunology and oncology. More specifically, the company develops, manufactures and markets a diverse portfolio of treatments for hemophilia and other bleeding disorders, immune deficiencies, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, burns and shock, and other chronic and acute medical conditions. Baxalta is also investing in new disease areas, including oncology, as well as emerging technology platforms, including gene therapy and biosimilars. Baxaltas business strategy is aimed at improving diagnosis, treatment and standards of care across a wide range of bleeding disorders and other rare chronic and acute medical conditions, capitalizing on the companys differentiated portfolio, ensuring the sustainability of supply to meet growing demand for therapies across core disease areas, and accelerating innovation by developing and launching new treatments while leveraging its expertise into new emerging therapeutics through acquisitions and collaborations. Baxalta was incorporated in Delaware on September 8, 2014 in connection with the separation of Baxter International Inc.s biopharmaceuticals business from its diversified medical products businesses. For a brief transition period after the spin-off, the companys corporate offices will continue to be located at One Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, Illinois. After this transition period, the companys corporate offices will be relocated to 1200 Lakeside Drive, Bannockburn, Illinois. Strengths Baxalta possesses a number of competitive advantages that distinguish the company from its competitors, including: Differentiated portfolio of leading products. Baxaltas portfolio consists of a number of market-leading therapies across core disease areas, particularly in hematology and immunology. Baxaltas portfolio includes a variety of additional differentiated therapies for the treatment of bleeding disorders and chronic and acute medical conditions, including hemophilia A, hemophilia B, acquired hemophilia, inhibitor treatments, primary immunodeficiency (PID) and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The company believes that all of these treatment areas have significant growth potential, as they remain under-diagnosed and under-treated on a global basis. Baxalta intends to capitalize on this growth opportunity by increasing awareness and diagnosis, expanding access to therapies, enhancing market penetration and improving standards of care. Baxaltas core disease therapies include:  ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)], the leading recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) therapy for the treatment of children and adults with hemophilia A;  FEIBA [Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Complex], a leading inhibitor management therapy;  GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)], a liquid formulation of the antibody-replacement therapy for the treatment of immune deficiencies and certain neurological disorders; and  HYQVIA [Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (Human) with Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase], an immune globulin with a recombinant human hyaluronidase for the treatment of PID in adults. Diverse biopharmaceuticals pipeline. Building and advancing Baxaltas existing product pipeline is a key driver of future growth. The current pipeline includes programs in hematology, oncology, immunology and biosimilars with a focus on rare diseases and areas of unmet medical need. The company has more than 20 72 Table of Contents programs under development, including those in development with collaboration partners, as it applies internal scientific expertise in addition to advancing the pipeline through a number of recent acquisitions and collaborations. Since the beginning of 2014, Baxalta received approval for five products in the United States (including further developments or indications of existing products), recently submitted two products for approval in the U.S., and currently has five programs, including collaborations, in late-stage clinical trials. Worldwide commercial infrastructure and opportunity for continued geographic penetration and expansion. Baxaltas products are sold in approximately 100 countries. Baxalta has strong and extensive sales, marketing, and distribution networks around the world to support its products. In 2014, Baxalta had sales of $2.9 billion outside of the United States, representing nearly half of Baxaltas total sales, including sales to emerging markets of $1.2 billion, representing 20% of total sales. Continued penetration of under-diagnosed and under-treated therapies will help drive growth across selected geographies. High-quality products and world-class manufacturing operations . Baxalta has an established heritage as a leader in quality manufacturing. Baxalta has strong, globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at its manufacturing sites, and conducts and supports internal and external inspections and audits at these sites. Baxaltas regional and global manufacturing teams seek to ensure that all of its contract manufacturers adhere to Baxaltas standards of manufacturing quality. The company utilizes a diversified network of proprietary manufacturing sites and contract manufacturers to maximize operational efficiencies and to help meet demand for the companys therapies. Baxaltas extensive manufacturing and supply chain expertise and capabilities position the company well to provide critical therapies for distribution in all major regions of the world and to meet growing demand over the long-term. Financial flexibility to fuel future growth. Baxalta retains strong financial flexibility, freeing the company to reinvest in the business and fuel future growth. In 2014, Baxalta generated $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and spent $970 million on capital expenditures. Baxalta anticipates that its business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow to allow the company to continue to invest in its new and expanding product pipeline and other areas to support and expand its business through both capital investments and strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and collaborations. Experienced management team with track record of successful performance. Baxaltas management team has a strong track record of performance and execution. Dr. Ludwig N. Hantson, who has served as a Corporate Vice President and President of BioScience at Baxter since 2010, is expected to be Baxaltas President and Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Hantson brings with him more than 25 years of industry experience, including in executive roles, serving as regional, division and country head at several large biopharmaceutical companies, as well as in leadership positions in the areas of commercial operations, sales and marketing, and clinical research and development.

Strategies Baxalta is seeking to grow its business by, among other things: Enhancing access through increasing awareness and diagnosis and improving standards of care. Baxalta is committed to supporting efforts to improve diagnosis and enhancing standards of care. A number of disease areas, such as hemophilia, primary immune deficiency (PID), multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and von Willebrand disease (VWD), are currently under-diagnosed and under-treated. For example, Baxalta believes based on historical data that diagnosis rates remain well under 50% for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, hemophilia A, hemophilia B and PID, and up to an estimated 60% for MMN. As awareness and diagnosis increases, Baxalta believes it can capitalize on its existing and developing product portfolio to address the rising demand for these areas of unmet medical need. Baxalta also seeks to differentiate itself through its commitment to increasing standards of care for its patients. As an example, in June 2014, Baxalta obtained European CE marking of myPKFiT, a new web-based individualized dosing device for prophylactic treatment of hemophilia A with ADVATE, which allows physicians to calculate personalized ADVATE treatment regimens based on patient information and individual pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. Further penetrating targeted emerging markets . In many emerging markets, population growth and economic development are driving increased demand for therapies such as Baxaltas. In addition, rising standards of living and healthcare in such markets increase the global marketplace for Baxaltas therapies. Based on the companys diverse product portfolio and its history of successfully utilizing regional and local sales and distribution capabilities, Baxalta believes that the company is well-positioned for growth in these emerging markets. For example, Baxalta believes that it has further opportunities to expand in targeted emerging markets by reaching new customers, by introducing more of the companys therapies into these markets and by supporting the adoption of the companys products. Baxalta believes that the company will be able to efficiently respond to the needs of its emerging market customers and provide strong customer service and support in these markets. Exploring additional models to partner with governments and other third parties. Baxalta is exploring alternative business models to partner with governments and other large patient care organizations to become the partner of choice, particularly in a number of emerging markets where utilization is very low. For example, in 2012 the company entered into an exclusive 20-year partnership with Hemobrás (Empresa Brasileira de Hemoderivado e Biotechnologia) to provide hemophilia patients in Brazil, the worlds third-largest hemophilia market, greater access to rFVIII therapy for the treatment of hemophilia A. The company has also entered into a 10-year contract manufacturing agreement with Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation of the Netherlands to enhance the supply of plasma-derived treatments for immune deficiencies, hemophilia, trauma and other critical conditions. These and similar measures will help to build and drive innovation and brand excellence on a global basis. 74 Table of Contents Augmenting Baxaltas product portfolio through organic growth, acquisitions and collaborations. Baxalta intends to continue to develop and grow its product portfolio through internal research and development (R&D) as well as through external acquisitions and collaborations. These R&D efforts enable the company to deliver innovative products to address areas of unmet medical need, and enhance current therapies so they remain relevant for Baxaltas customers. Baxalta leverages its brand leadership to position the company to capitalize on enhancing access with the introduction of new therapeutics and indications. While continuing to leverage its expertise and develop therapies in its core disease areas, Baxalta intends to further diversify its product portfolio and pipeline by shifting to therapies for diseases beyond hemophilia, such as blood disorders, liquid and solid tumors and immunologic conditions. Baxalta incurred R&D expenses of $820 million in 2014 and believes that at least seven new products in its R&D portfolio have the potential to reach the market by 2018, along with several other indications or developments with respect to existing products and geographic expansions of such products. Baxalta also intends to continue to grow its business through acquisitions, asset purchases, in-licensing transactions, development, supply and distribution agreements and other strategic partnerships, as well as through the growth of its existing products resulting from such factors as increased awareness and diagnosis, and further penetration into emerging markets. Baxalta has entered into several significant collaborations, alliances and other business development transactions to support its growth, including:  AesRx Acquisition.

Accessing new products and technologies through scientific partnerships . Baxalta intends to continue to expand its network of research partnerships around the globe in order to gain access to new technologies, including its relationships with universities and other public and private institutions. The transition of Baxaltas R&D hub to Cambridge, Massachusetts, will enhance its ability to leverage expertise in the greater Boston area and forge strategic partnerships with leading biotechnology companies and academic and research institutions. In addition, Baxalta will have the ability to explore opportunities to enter into collaboration agreements and external alliances with other parties under its own standalone growth and investment strategies. Continuing to provide high-quality products and drive manufacturing efficiencies . Baxalta is a leader in quality manufacturing. Baxaltas global commercial and manufacturing teams collaborate on various operational efficiency initiatives, including yield improvements, procurement, site and area synergies and manufacturing support rationalization, intended to improve Baxaltas manufacturing margins. Baxaltas manufacturing and supply chain provide it with a flexible and scalable global platform for continued expansion, including in emerging markets. 76 Table of Contents Managing the product portfolio to maximize value. Baxalta plans to continue its investment in products with durable sales, while making adjustments as necessary to increase the value of its product portfolio. Baxalta intends to achieve this objective in a variety of ways depending on product and circumstances by, for example, identifying supply chain efficiencies, pursuing additional indications, and employing strong product lifecycle management. Baxalta believes that its approach will allow the company to maintain a strong operating margin on existing products. Products Baxaltas business consists of a portfolio of products serving patient needs in a variety of ways. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the notes to the financial statements below present certain financial information related to Baxaltas products by reference to four categories of products. Those four groups, Hemophilia, Inhibitor Therapies, Immunoglobulin Therapies and BioTherapeutics, are further described below, together with selected details for products within each group. Hemophilia . Baxalta is a market leader in hemophilia therapies, and expects to continue to build on that leadership position with new therapies for bleeding disorders. The Hemophilia category accounted for $3.0 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.6 billion, or 50%, 50% and 49%, of Baxaltas sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Hemophilia products currently offered by Baxalta include:  ADVATE . ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)] is the worlds leading rFVIII therapy. ADVATE is a recombinant antihemophilic factor indicated for use in adults and children with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia) for control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative management and routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes. Baxalta believes based on historical data that well over 50% of those with hemophilia A, which is the most prevalent form of hemophilia and occupies approximately $6 billion of the global market for hemophilia treatments, remain undiagnosed. ADVATE is approved in over 60 countries, and Baxalta intends to continue to improve diagnosis and prophylaxis treatment rates and overall access to ADVATE-based therapies over the next several years.  RECOMBINATE . RECOMBINATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)], as with ADVATE, is a recombinant antihemophilic factor indicated for use in adults and children with hemophilia A for control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative management and routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes.

ARALAST NP is an alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (Alpha1-PI) indicated for chronic augmentation therapy in adults with clinically evident emphysema due to severe congenital deficiency of Alpha1-PI (alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency). ARALAST NP increases antigenic and functional (anti-neutrophil elastase capacity, ANEC) serum levels and antigenic lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF) levels of Alpha1-PI.  GLASSIA NP . GLASSIA NP is also an Alpha1-PI used for adults who have clinically evident emphysema due to severe congenital alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. GLASSIA is used to increase antigenic and functional (anti-neutrophil elastase capacity, or ANEC) serum levels and antigenic lung ELF levels of Alpha1-PI.  CEPROTIN. CEPROTIN is a protein C concentrate [(Human)] replacement therapy to increase protein C to levels that reduce symptoms by allowing the blood to clot normally. Protein C plays an important part in blood clotting by stopping the blood from clotting when enough clots have been produced. If not corrected, damage from too much clotting can cause death.  ANTITHROMBIN III IMMUNO. ANTITHROMBIN III IMMUNO, Antithrombin III (human) contains antithrombin III in a sterile, purified, concentrated and stabilized form. ANTITHROMBIN III IMMUNO is indicated for prophylaxis and treatment of thrombotic and thromboembolic disorders in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency (antithrombin III activity below 70% of normal). Infusions of antithrombin III may be particularly valuable in surgical procedures or pregnancy and delivery in patients with congenital antithrombin III deficiency. 79 Table of Contents Enhancements and Increased Access to Approved Products. Baxalta works to expand treatment options for patients by seeking additional indications for and developing innovative enhancements to its existing product portfolio. In addition, Baxalta expands access to its products for patients geographically by seeking regulatory approvals for its products throughout the globe and developing innovative partnerships with foreign governments. Recent examples of such enhancements and expansions include:  In July 2014, FLEXBUMIN 5% was approved in the United States, expanding Baxaltas FLEXBUMIN product portfolio, which is the first and only preparation of human albumin to be packaged in a flexible plastic container, to include both 5% in a 250 mL solution and 25% in 50 and 100 mL solutions.  In April 2014, the new BAXJECT III needleless reconstitution system for ADVATE was approved in the United States, which allows patients to prepare their treatment with fewer steps compared to the previous process. The company has filed for approval of ADVATE with BAXJECT III system in Europe, with a planned launch there in 2015.  In July 2014, Baxalta obtained European CE marking of myPKFiT, a web-based individualized dosing device for prophylactic treatment of hemophilia A with ADVATE. The device allows physicians to calculate personalized ADVATE treatment regimens based on patient information and individual pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles.  In 2014, ADVATE was approved by regulators in Turkey and Russia and the company received European approval for its production at a new facility in Singapore. Building a Diversified Biopharmaceutical Pipeline Baxalta is committed to developing a robust new product pipeline focused on new and innovative treatments that address unmet medical needs and investing resources to develop and grow a broad-based and innovative biopharmaceutical pipeline, including by exploring new indications and emerging uses based on Baxaltas current portfolio, as well as executing product enhancements designed to meet patient and provider needs.

Baxalta has exclusive commercialization rights for all indications outside the United States, and will jointly commercialize pacritinib (BAX 2201) in the United States with CTI BioPharma. Positive top-line results from the Phase III trials were announced in March 2015. nal-IRI (MM-398). In September 2014, Baxalta entered into an exclusive license and collaboration agreement with Merrimack for the development and commercialization of nal-IRI (MM-398), an investigational drug candidate for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treated with a gemcitabine-based therapy, for all potential indications outside the United States and Taiwan. nal-IRI has completed a Phase III program in second-line pancreatic cancer, and Baxalta filed for approval for this indication in the EU in May 2015. In November 2014, FDA granted nal-IRI Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who have been previously treated with gemcitabine-based therapy. BAX 069 . BAX 069 is a monoclonal antibody with a novel mode of action for the treatment of solid tumors, targeting the oxidized form of cytokine macrophage migration inhibitor factor (oxMIF). BAX 069 is currently in Phase I clinical trials, which have completed enrollment. Rigosertib. Baxalta has obtained from Onconova Therapeutics, Inc. (Onconova) the exclusive EU marketing rights to rigosertib (BAX 2201), a novel, targeted anti-cancer compound. Onconova has announced that the Phase III study for the treatment of high-risk MDS, a rare hematological malignancy, did not meet its primary endpoint. The trial did achieve a statistically significant benefit in median survival in a post-hoc analysis of a subset of patients who failed or progressed on previous treatments with hypomethylating agents. Baxalta continues to work with Onconova to evaluate the appropriate next steps and support the continued engagement with regulatory authorities. Immunology 20% GAMMAGARD LIQUID SubQ. 20% GAMMAGARD LIQUID SubQ is a higher-potency immunoglobulin therapy offering patients faster infusions with less volume. Baxalta has completed Phase III enrollment in the EU and the United States, and filed for approval in Europe in May 2015. GAMMAGARD LIQUID and HYQVIA for CIDP. Baxalta is undertaking efforts to expand indications for its GAMMAGARD LIQUID / KIOVIG and HYQVIA products to include the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), a neurological disorder characterized by progressive weakness and impaired sensory function in the legs and arms. SM101. In March 2015, Baxalta acquired SuppreMol and its lead product candidate SM101, an investigational immunoregulatory treatment that has completed Phase 2a studies in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP, a disorder causing low platelet levels) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, a disorder in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue). Biosimilars With approximately $70 billion in branded biologics going off patent by 2021, biosimilars present an attractive growth opportunity for Baxalta. Baxaltas biosimilars collaborations include the following: CHS-0214/BAX 2200. Baxalta has established a collaboration with Coherus to develop and commercialize CHS-0214/BAX 2200, a biosimilar product candidate for ENBREL ® (etanercept), indicated for the treatment of autoimmune deficiencies, in Europe, Canada, Brazil and other markets. This is Baxaltas most advanced biosimilar, currently in Phase III clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, and in early stage clinical trials has demonstrated pharmacokinetic (PK) equivalence versus the innovator molecule. 83 Table of Contents Momenta Collaboration. Baxalta is collaborating with Momenta on the development and commercialization of M923/BAX 2923, a biosimilar product candidate for HUMIRA ® (adalimumab) indicated for certain autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, which is currently in early-stage development. In December 2014, a European clinical trial application for M923/BAX 2923 was accepted by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. In June 2015, Baxalta entered into an agreement with SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group (SFJ) relating to M923/BAX 2923 whereby SFJ will fund up to $200 million of specified development costs related to Baxaltas M923/BAX 2923 program in exchange for payments in the event the product obtains regulatory approval in the United States and/or Europe. The contingent success payments, which would total approximately 5.5 times the incurred development costs, would be paid in installments over several years following the date(s) of regulatory approval. For more information on biosimilars, see Intellectual Property and Regulation. Research and Development Activities Baxaltas investment in R&D is essential to its future growth and its ability to remain competitive in the markets in which it participates. Accordingly, Baxalta continues to focus its investment in R&D programs to enhance future growth through clinical differentiation. Expenditures for Baxaltas R&D activities were $820 million in 2014, $595 million in 2013 and $581 million in 2012. These expenditures include costs associated with R&D activities performed at Baxters R&D centers as well as in-licensing, milestone and reimbursement payments made to partners for R&D work performed at non-Baxter locations. Included in Baxaltas R&D activities in 2014 were upfront and milestone payments to collaboration partners of $217 million. Baxaltas research efforts emphasize self-manufactured product development, and portions of that research relate to multiple product categories. Baxalta supplements its own R&D efforts by acquiring various technologies and entering into development and other collaboration agreements with third parties. In addition, Baxalta has been actively engaged in investigating new potential biosimilar and oncology treatments, primarily through business collaborations. Baxalta expects to continue to explore external partnerships as part of its product development and R&D efforts. Collaboration agreements with third parties often result in Baxalta making an upfront payment to its partners upon the initial execution of a collaboration or similar agreement and future contingent payments to Baxaltas partners upon the achievement of development, regulatory, commercial or other milestones. These upfront payments and pre-regulatory approval milestone payments are expensed to R&D and may result in significant R&D charges in one period with no comparable charge or charges in another period. The timing and impact of these payments on the companys results of operations and financial condition may be difficult to predict. In 2014, Baxalta announced that the company entered into a long-term lease in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a facility that will serve as the companys global innovation and R&D center. Also in 2014, Baxalta entered into a strategic partnership with Quintiles, a leading global provider of biopharmaceutical development and commercial outsourcing services, pursuant to which Quintiles will assume responsibility for routine clinical development activities for Baxalta and provide strategic input to certain R&D programs. Baxalta will maintain the leadership, management and accountability roles for its R&D programs, as well as operational responsibility for its early stage and non-clinical research. For more information on the companys R&D activities, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResearch and Development. Quality Management Baxaltas success depends upon the quality of its products. Quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, facilitating continuous improvement of the companys 84 Table of Contents products, processes and services, and assuring the safety and efficacy of the companys products. Baxalta has one quality system deployed globally that enables the design, development, manufacturing, packaging, sterilization, handling, distribution and labeling of the companys products to ensure they conform to customer requirements. In order to continually improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the quality system, various measurements, monitoring and analysis methods such as management reviews and internal, external and vendor audits are employed at local and central levels. Each product that Baxalta markets is required to meet specific quality standards, both in packaging and in product integrity and quality. If any product is determined to be compromised at any time, Baxalta takes all corrective and preventive actions necessary to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to meet customer expectations. Intellectual Property Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to Baxaltas business. Baxalta relies on patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and confidentiality agreements to develop, maintain and strengthen its competitive position. Baxalta owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements relating to various third-party patents and technologies. Products manufactured by Baxalta are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names. Some products distributed by the company are sold under the companys trade names, while others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers or partners. Trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to Baxalta. The company maintains certain details about its products, processes and technology as trade secrets and generally requires employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements may be breached and Baxalta may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, Baxaltas trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that Baxaltas employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Biologics are entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the PPACA. The PPACA provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. The PPACA also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity, and enforceability prior to the approval of the biosimilar. The PPACA does not, however, change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. For more information regarding governmental regulation of biosimilars, see Regulation. Baxaltas policy is to protect its products and technology through patents, the maintenance of trade secrets and trademarks on a worldwide basis. This protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company. Baxalta also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its intellectual property and takes commercially reasonable steps to enforce its intellectual property around the world against potential infringers, including judicial or administrative action where appropriate. Baxalta operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent litigation. At any given time, the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual property-related actions. Such litigation can result in significant royalty or other payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of products. For more information on litigation, see Legal Proceedings. 85 Table of Contents Regulation The operations of Baxalta and many of the products it manufactures or sells are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies, both within and outside the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) and other government agencies both inside and outside of the United States, regulate the testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and advertising, distribution and post-market surveillance of Baxaltas products. The company must obtain specific approval from FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can market and sell most of its products in a particular country. In the United States, Baxaltas products often undergo a three phase clinical testing program, with the results of preclinical and clinical trials submitted to FDA in the form of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for biologic products. Most non-United States jurisdictions where Baxalta markets its products have product approval and post-approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the United States. In Europe, for example, there are several tracks for marketing approval, depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure in Europe, a company submits a single application to the EMA that is similar to the BLA in the United States. A marketing application approved by the European Commission (EC) is valid in all member states. In addition to the centralized procedure, Europe also has various other methods for submitting applications and receiving approvals. Regardless of the approval process employed, various parties share responsibilities for the monitoring, detection, and evaluation of adverse events post-approval, including national authorities, the EMA, the EC, and the marketing authorization holder. In some regions, it is possible to receive an accelerated review whereby the national regulatory authority will commit to truncated review timelines for products that meet specific medical needs. The complex nature of biologics, including biosimilar formulations of reference biologic products, has warranted the creation of biosimilar regulatory approval pathways with strict, science-based approval standards that take into account patient safety considerations. These biosimilar approval pathways are considered to be more abbreviated than for new biologics, although they are significantly different from the abbreviated approval pathways available for generic drugs (small-molecule drugs that are the same as, and bioequivalent to, an already-approved small molecule drug). The European Union has created a pathway for the approval of biosimilars, and has published guidance for approval of certain biosimilar products. More recently, in 2010, the PPACA authorized FDA to approve biosimilars, but the U.S. approval pathway for biosimilar applications remains relatively untested and is subject to ongoing guidance from FDA. While mature pathways for regulatory approval of generic drugs and healthcare systems exist around the globe that support and promote the substitutability of generic drugs, the approval pathways for biosimilar products remain in various stages of development, as do private and public initiatives or actions supporting the substitutability of biosimilar products. Thus, the extent to which biosimilars will be viewed as readily substitutable, and in practice readily substituted, for the reference biologic product is largely yet to be determined. The PPACA establishes a period of 12 years of data exclusivity for reference biologic products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation. Under this framework, FDA cannot make a product approval effective for any biosimilar application until at least 12 years after the reference products date of first licensure. Changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review, including multiple regulatory submissions, and approvals are not certain. Even after the company obtains regulatory approval to market a product, the product and the companys manufacturing processes and quality systems are subject to continued review by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally. State agencies in the United States also regulate the facilities, operations, employees, products and services of the company within their respective states. The company and its facilities are subject to periodic inspections and possible administrative and legal actions by FDA and other regulatory agencies inside and outside the United States. Such actions may include warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or 86 Table of Contents withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. As situations require, the company takes steps to ensure safety and efficacy of its products, such as removing products found not to meet applicable requirements from the market and improving the effectiveness of quality systems. Baxalta and its products are also subject to various other regulatory regimes both inside and outside the United States. In the United States alone, the company is subject to the oversight of FDA, the Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG), the Center for Medicare/Medicaid Services (CMS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Defense and Customs and Border Protection, in addition to others. The company supplies products and services to healthcare providers that are reimbursed by federally funded programs such as Medicare. As a result, the companys activities are subject to regulation by CMS and enforcement by OIG and DOJ. In jurisdictions outside the United States, the companys activities are subject to regulation by government agencies including the EMA in Europe, CFDA in China and other agencies in other jurisdictions. Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare companies in recent years. These actions appear to be part of a general trend toward increased enforcement activity globally. The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion and production of products) and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, OIG, DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. False claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). The DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally. FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities and communications for products under its jurisdiction both before and after approval. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for off-label usesthat is, uses not approved by FDA and therefore not described in the drugs labelingbecause FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers communications regarding off-label uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a drug for off-label use, but may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding off-label use under certain conditions. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by FDA, DOJ, or OIG and the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. Noncompliance could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial and financial impact, including civil and criminal fines and the imposition of agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes its products. 87 Table of Contents Ethics and Compliance In order to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations, Baxalta has established a comprehensive global ethics and compliance program. The program is intended to prevent, detect and mitigate risk across the organization and throughout the lifecycle of Baxaltas products. Baxaltas program starts with a culture and expectation of compliance at all levels of the organization. It also includes, among other things, resources to address compliance globally; formal compliance governance; mechanisms to intake questions and concerns; policies, processes, and procedures; communications; training; various forms of risk-based auditing and monitoring; review of alleged misconduct; and, when necessary, disciplinary action for failure to comply. All of these actions are intended to protect Baxalta from conduct by individual employees and agents that may be in violation of legal and regulatory requirements and the companys compliance expectations. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Baxaltas business. Baxalta expects that compliance with laws and regulations around the globe will increasingly require significant technical expertise and capital investment. Healthcare regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining approval to market and promote products, and Baxaltas failure to meet its compliance obligations may result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of products, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for product production and sale, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. The company expects to continuously devote substantial resources to proactively maintain, administer and expand its compliance program globally. Sales, Marketing and Distribution Capabilities Baxalta has its own direct sales force and also makes sales to and through independent distributors, drug wholesalers acting as sales agents and specialty pharmacy or other alternate site providers. The company reviews its sales channels from time to time, and will make changes in its sales and distribution model as the company believes necessary to best implement the companys business plan and strategies. Managed care providers (for example, health maintenance organizations), hospitals, and state and federal government agencies are also important customers. In the United States, third parties warehouse and ship a significant portion of the companys products through their distribution centers. These centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer service. Sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by sales and customer service representatives, automated communications via various electronic purchasing systems, circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins, direct-mail campaigns, trade publication presence and advertising. International sales are made and products are distributed on a direct basis or through independent distributors or sales agents in approximately 100 countries. In many international locations, including much of Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia, for example, the government purchases products through public tenders or collective purchasing. Facilities, Manufacturing Capabilities and Operations For a brief transition period after the spin-off, the companys corporate offices will continue to be located at One Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, Illinois. In 2015, Baxalta announced that it had entered into a long-term lease agreement for a 260,000 square foot facility in Bannockburn, Illinois that will serve as Baxaltas global headquarters after the transition period. 88 Table of Contents Baxalta manufactures its products in more than ten manufacturing facilities around the world. Baxalta owns or has long-term leases on all of its manufacturing facilities. The companys principal manufacturing facilities are listed below. Location Owned/Leased Orth, Austria Owned Vienna, Austria Owned Lessines, Belgium Owned Hayward, California Leased Los Angeles, California Owned Thousand Oaks, California Owned Pisa, Italy Owned Rieti, Italy Owned Milford, Massachusetts Owned Brooklyn Park, Minnesota Owned Woodlands, Singapore Owned/Leased(1) Neuchatel, Switzerland Owned (1) Baxalta owns the facility at Woodlands, Singapore, and leases the property upon which it rests. In addition to the manufacturing facilities listed above, Baxalta is currently building a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility near Covington, Georgia, to support the growth of its plasma-based products. The timeline on the project spans several years with commercial production scheduled to begin in 2018. The company is also expanding its manufacturing facility in Krems, Austria, with production expected to commence at the expanded facility in 2018. In 2014, Baxalta announced that the company entered into a long-term lease in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a facility that will serve as the companys global innovation and R&D center. The companys facility in Hoover, Alabama is a critical facility for the testing of human plasma, including plasma collected by its BioLife subsidiary (as more fully described below under Sources and Availability of Raw Materials) for use in the companys products. Baxaltas properties include facilities which, in the companys opinion, are suitable and adequate for development, manufacture, and distribution of its products. Third Party Agreements Baxalta has agreements with third parties for process development, analytical services, and manufacturing of certain products. Baxalta procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. Baxalta also will have certain agreements with Baxter following the separation, including as described in Certain Relationships and Related Person TransactionsAgreements with BaxterManufacturing and Supply Agreement. Sources and Availability of Raw Materials Baxalta purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world, including in the United States. While efforts are made to diversify Baxaltas source of components and materials, in certain instances Baxalta acquires components and materials from a sole supplier. Human plasma is a critical raw material in Baxaltas business. The company believes that its ability to internally and externally source plasma represents a distinctive and flexible infrastructure, which provides the 89 Table of Contents company a unique capability with respect to the consistent delivery of high quality plasma-based products. Baxalta owns and operates plasma collection facilities in the United States and Austria through its wholly owned subsidiary BioLife Plasma Services L.P. (BioLife). BioLife operates and maintains more than 65 state-of-the-art plasma collection facilities in 23 states throughout the United States and at seven locations in Austria. Baxalta also maintains relationships with other plasma suppliers to ensure that it retains the flexibility to meet market demand for its plasma-based therapies, including through its 10-year contract manufacturing agreement with Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation of the Netherlands. There have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages with respect to raw materials. For additional information regarding sources and availability of raw materials, see the discussion of such matters under Risk FactorsRisks Related to Baxaltas BusinessIf Baxalta is unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if it experiences other manufacturing or supply difficulties, its business may be adversely affected. Competition and Healthcare Cost Containment Baxalta enjoys leading positions based on a number of competitive advantages. The Baxalta business benefits from continued innovation in its products and therapies, consistency of its supply of products, strong customer relationships and the technological advantages of its products. Baxalta faces substantial competition from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies of all sizes, in the United States and internationally, and such competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing channels. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product effectiveness and quality, patient convenience and technological innovation. There has been increasing consolidation in the companys customer base, which continues to result in pricing and market pressures. The principal sources of competition for Baxaltas principal products globally are as follows:  ADVATE: Xyntha ® /ReFacto AF ® (Pfizer and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum); Kogenate ® (Bayer); Helixate ® (CSL Behring); Eloctate ® (Biogen Idec); NovoEight ® (Novo Nordisk); and Nuwiq ® (Octapharma).  FEIBA: NovoSeven ® /NovoSeven RT ® (Novo Nordisk); Coagil VII ® (Pharmstandard); and Facteur VII-LFB ® (LFB Group).  GAMMAGARD LIQUID: Privigen ® /Hizentra ® /Carimune NF ® (CSL Behring); Flebogamma DIF ® /Gamunex-C ® (Grifols); Octagam ® /Octagam 10 ® /Gammanorm ® (Octapharma); Ig Vena ® /Gammaked ® (Kedrion); and Intratect 10% ® /Intratect, Intraglobin F ® /Bivigam ® (Biotest). Additionally, for each of the principal products listed above, there are additional competitive products or alternative therapy regimens available on a more limited geographic basis throughout the world. In March 2010, the PPACA was enacted in the United States. While this legislation provides for a number of changes in how companies are compensated for providing healthcare products and services, many of these changes are still being implemented by regulations. The PPACA includes several provisions which impact the companys businesses in the United States, including a tax on the sales of its pharmaceutical products to the government, increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations, with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs and medical devices. For additional information regarding competition and healthcare cost containment, see the discussion of such matters in the Risk Factors section of this prospectus, including the following:  Risk FactorsRisks Related to Baxaltas BusinessBaxaltas products face substantial competition in the product markets in which it operates. 90 Table of Contents  Risk FactorsRisks Related to Baxaltas BusinessIf reimbursement or other payment for Baxaltas current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or abroad, including through the implementation of government-sponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions, cost containment measures, or changes to policies with respect to pricing, taxation or rebates, then Baxaltas business could suffer.  Risk FactorsRisks Related to Baxaltas BusinessBaxalta faces competition in the development of relationships with research, academic and governmental institutions. Employees Baxalta expects to employ approximately 16,000 persons as of the distribution date. Outside the United States, some of Baxaltas employees are represented by unions or works councils. Baxalta believes that it has good relations with its employees and their unions and works councils. Environmental Matters Environmental policies of the company require compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate, among other things, appropriate capital expenditures for environmental protection. Legal Proceedings Baxalta is from time to time subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims and litigation may include, among other things, allegations of violation of United States and foreign competition law, labor laws, consumer protection laws, and environmental laws and regulations, as well as claims or litigation relating to product liability, intellectual property, securities, breach of contract and tort. Baxalta operates in multiple jurisdictions and, as a result, a claim in one jurisdiction may lead to claims or regulatory penalties in other jurisdictions. Baxalta intends to defend vigorously against any pending or future claims and litigation. On February 25, 2015, Baxalta received a notice of a violation from the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District as a result of it self-reporting certain violations of environmental regulations at its manufacturing facility located in Thousand Oaks, California, to that agency promptly after discovery on October 16, 2014, as required by local regulations. Pursuant to that notice, Baxalta paid penalties in the amount of $103,000 to the agency, which releases Baxalta of any further claims or liabilities for such violations. For a description of further legal proceedings, see Note 14 to the audited combined financial statements. While the liability of the company in connection with certain claims cannot be estimated with any certainty, and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the companys results of operations and cash flows for that period, the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys combined financial position. While Baxalta believes it has valid defenses in these matters, litigation is inherently uncertain, excessive verdicts do occur, and the company may in the future incur material judgments against it or enter into settlements of claims resulting in material financial payments or otherwise having a material operational or financial impact on the company. Divestitures and Discontinued Operations In July 2014, the company entered into an agreement to sell its commercial vaccines business and committed to a plan to divest the remainder of its vaccines business, which includes certain R&D programs. In December 2014, the company completed the sale of the commercial vaccines business and entered into an agreement to sell the remainder of the vaccines business. As a result of the divestitures, the operations and cash flows of the vaccines business will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company. In addition, the company will not have significant continuing involvement or cash flows from the operations associated with the vaccines business. 91 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT Executive Officers Following the Distribution While some of Baxaltas expected executive officers are currently officers and employees of Baxter, upon the distribution, none of these individuals will continue to be employees or executive officers of Baxter. The following table sets forth information regarding individuals who are expected to serve as Baxaltas executive officers, including their positions after the distribution. Name Age Title Ludwig N.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation During the companys fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, Baxalta was not an independent company, and did not have a compensation committee or any other committee serving a similar function. Decisions as to the compensation of Baxaltas executive officers who currently serve as Baxters executive officers were made by Baxter, as described in the section of this prospectus captioned Executive CompensationCompensation Discussion and Analysis. 96 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Baxalta expects that its Board of Directors will periodically review its corporate governance practices and take other actions to address changes in regulatory requirements, developments in governance best practices and matters raised by shareholders. Director Independence It is expected that Baxaltas Board of Directors will adopt Corporate Governance Guidelines that will require that the Baxalta Board of Directors be composed of a majority of directors who meet the criteria for independence established by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. To be considered independent, the Board of Directors must affirmatively determine that a director does not have any direct or indirect material relationship with Baxalta (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Baxalta), and solely with regard to Compensation Committee Members, consider all relevant factors that could impair the ability of such Compensation Committee members to make independent judgments about executive compensation. In making its independence determinations, the Board of Directors considers transactions, relationships and arrangements between Baxalta and entities with which directors are associated as executive officers, directors and trustees. When these transactions, relationships and arrangements exist, they are in the ordinary course of business and are of a type customary for a global company such as Baxalta. Director Qualifications The experience, expertise and knowledge represented by the Board of Directors as a collective body allows the Board to lead Baxalta in a manner that serves its shareholders interests appropriately. Set forth below is a discussion of the key qualifications for each of the directors in which are expected to align with the criteria to be included in Baxaltas Corporate Governance Guidelines. Mr. Devitt Significant accounting expertise and knowledge of the healthcare industry through his 33-year career at Ernst & Young, including his service as Director of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Industry Practice Mr. Forsyth Extensive experience in the healthcare industry as well as an understanding of the challenges associated with leading and operating within large, complex organizations as current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield and his 25 years of management experience at the University of Michigan Health System Ms. Fosler Substantial experience with respect to corporate best practices as well as significant global economic expertise, with an emphasis on emerging markets, especially China, as a result of her more than 20-year leadership career at The Conference Board and her other public-company board service Dr. Gavin Extensive medical and scientific expertise and knowledge of the healthcare industry as a result of the positions he has held at Emory University, the Morehouse School of Medicine and Howard Hughes Medical Institute as well as leadership experience given his service as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Medical Officer of Healing Our Village, Inc. Dr. Hantson Extensive experience leading and operating within global, multi-faceted corporations and deep knowledge of the biopharmaceuticals industry as a result of more than 25 years spent in roles of increasing responsibility at Baxter, Novartis and Johnson & Johnson Dr. Hockmeyer Substantial experience developing and running a significant biopharmaceutical company as founder and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MedImmune and significant scientific and clinical expertise as a result of his roles at Praxis Biologics Inc. and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research 97 Table of Contents Mr. Stroucken Substantial experience leading and operating large, multi-faceted corporations and financial expertise as a result of serving as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Owens-Illinois, Inc. and H.B. Fuller Company as well as experience in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries through his roles at Bayer Nomination of Directors Baxaltas amended and restated bylaws will contain provisions that address the process by which a shareholder may nominate an individual to stand for election to the Board of Directors. Baxalta expects that its Board of Directors will adopt a policy concerning the evaluation of shareholder recommendations of Board candidates by the Corporate Governance Committee. Corporate Governance Guidelines The Baxalta Board of Directors is expected to adopt a set of Corporate Governance Guidelines in connection with the separation to assist it in guiding Baxaltas governance practices. These practices will be regularly re-evaluated by the Corporate Governance Committee in light of changing circumstances in order to continue serving the companys best interests and the best interests of its shareholders. Baxaltas Corporate Governance Guidelines are expected to cover topics including, but not limited to, director qualification standards, director responsibilities (including those of the Chairman), director access to management and independent advisors, director compensation, director orientation and continuing education, succession planning and the annual evaluations of the Board of Directors and its committees. Communicating with the Board of Directors Baxaltas Corporate Governance Guidelines are expected to include procedures by which shareholders and other interested parties may contact any of Baxaltas directors, including the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the non-management directors as a group, by writing a letter to Baxalta Director c/o Corporate Secretary, Baxalta Incorporated, One Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, Illinois 60015 or by sending an e-mail to boardofdirectors@baxalta.com. Baxaltas Corporate Secretary will forward communications to the Board directly to the Chairman, unless a different director is specified. Director Qualification Standards Baxaltas Corporate Governance Guidelines are expected to provide that the Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing with the Board of Directors the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members in the context of the makeup of the Board of Directors and developing criteria for identifying and evaluating Board candidates. The process that this committee will use to identify a nominee to serve as a member of the Board of Directors will depend on the qualities being sought. From time to time, Baxalta may engage an independent search firm to assist the committee in identifying individuals qualified to be Board members. Board members should have backgrounds that when combined provide a portfolio of experience and knowledge that will serve Baxaltas governance and strategic needs. In the process of identifying nominees to serve as a member of the Board of Directors, the Corporate Governance Committee will consider diversity of background, including diversity of gender, race, ethnic or geographic origin, age, and experience (including in business, government and education as well as healthcare, science and technology) as a relevant factor in the selection process. This factor is relevant as a diverse Board of Directors is likely to be a well-balanced Board of Directors with varying perspectives and a breadth of experience that will positively contribute to robust discussion at Board of Directors meetings. 98 Table of Contents A nominees ability to meet the independence criteria established by the New York Stock Exchange will also be a factor in the nominee selection process. Once a candidate has been identified, the Corporate Governance Committee and the independent search firm, if any, will engage in a process that includes a thorough investigation of the candidate, an examination of his or her business background and education, research on the individuals accomplishments and qualifications, an in-person interview and reference checking. If this process generates a positive indication, the members of the Corporate Governance Committee and the Chairman of the Board of Directors will meet separately with the candidate and then confer with each other regarding their respective impressions of the candidate. If the individual was positively received, the Corporate Governance Committee will then recommend the individual to the full Board of Directors for further meetings and evaluation and ultimately election. If the full Board of Directors agrees, the Chairman of the Board of Directors will then be authorized to extend an offer to the individual candidate. Board Leadership Structure Baxaltas Corporate Governance Guidelines provide the Board of Directors flexibility in determining its leadership structure. Upon the distribution, Ludwig N. Hantson, Ph.D. is expected to serve as Baxaltas Chief Executive Officer and Wayne T. Hockmeyer, Ph.D. is expected to serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Baxalta believes that this leadership structure, which separates the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles, is optimal at this time because it allows Dr. Hantson to focus on operating and managing Baxalta following Baxaltas transition to being a public company while Dr. Hockmeyer can focus on the leadership of the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, pursuant to Baxaltas amended and restated bylaws, would preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and shareholders, and act as liaison between the Board of Directors and the shareholders. The Board of Directors will periodically evaluate leadership structure and determine whether continuing the separate roles of Board of Directors Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is in Baxaltas best interests based on circumstances existing at the time, including the skills and experience that the selected Chairman and Chief Executive Officer bring to these roles. Code of Conduct In connection with the separation, Baxalta will adopt a Code of Conduct that requires all its business activities to be conducted in compliance with laws, regulations, and ethical principles and values. The Code of Conduct will apply to all members of Baxaltas Board of Directors and all of Baxaltas employees, including Baxaltas Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller and other senior financial officers. Any amendment to, or waiver from, a provision of the Code of Conduct that applies to Baxaltas Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller or persons performing similar functions will be disclosed on Baxaltas website. The Code of Conduct will be available on Baxaltas website. Non-Employee Director Compensation Baxaltas non-employee directors have not received, and will not receive, any compensation for their service on Baxaltas Board of Directors prior to the completion of the distribution. Baxalta is currently reviewing the compensation that it will pay to its non-employee directors following the distribution, but anticipates that its non-employee directors will be compensated for their service under a non-employee director compensation plan. Baxaltas non-employee director compensation plan is expected to include cash compensation and annual equity awards. 99 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Introduction Baxalta is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of Baxter, and the Compensation Committee of Baxters Board of Directors determined the past compensation of Baxaltas executive officers who were also executive officers of Baxter. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis, as well as the Summary Compensation Tables and accompanying information below, discusses these historical compensation practices of Baxter. The only information in this Executive Compensation section that addresses compensation effects of the distribution or anticipated compensation with Baxalta after the distribution is set forth below under Effects of the Separation on Outstanding Executive Compensation Awards; Baxalta Compensation. While certain expectations regarding post-distribution compensation are included herein, Baxaltas own Compensation Committee and Board of Directors will determine Baxaltas executive compensation policies following the distribution. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis presents historical compensation information for Dr. Hantson and Mr. Hombach, since they are both current named executive officers at Baxter, but generally does not address the specific compensation decisions for the other individuals who are expected to be Baxaltas executive officers as none of them are executive officers at Baxter and therefore Baxters Compensation Committee did not make such decisions directly. Among the individuals who are expected to serve as Baxaltas executive officers, the three most highly compensated in 2014 were Brian Goff, who is expected to serve as Baxaltas Executive Vice President and President, Hematology, Dagmar Rosa-Björkeson, who is expected to serve as Baxaltas Executive Vice President and President, Biosimilars, and Patrice Zagame, who is expected to serve as Baxaltas Executive Vice President and President, Intercontinental, and as such have been included in the Executive Compensation Tables below. Decisions related to the compensation of Mr. Goff in 2014 were made by Baxter management, and Ms. Rosa-Björkesons and Dr. Zagames compensation in 2014 was negotiated in conjunction with their hiring. Additional information about Baxaltas expected senior executive team following the distribution is set forth in the section of this prospectus captioned ManagementExecutive Officers Following the Distribution. Compensation Discussion and Analysis The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes Baxters compensation philosophy, policies and practices as they applied to Dr. Hantson and Mr. Hombach in 2014. Compensation Philosophy Baxters compensation program is designed to:  Recognize both Baxter and individual performance;  Drive the long-term financial performance of Baxter (and in doing so, encourage innovation and appropriate levels of risk-taking); and  Reflect the value of each officers position in the market and within Baxter. The objective of the program is to compensate Baxters executive officers in a manner that is consistent with these principles, aligns the interests of management and shareholders and drives sustained and superior performance relative to Baxters peers. The program is also designed to be comparable with companies with which Baxter competes for executive talent in order to attract, retain and motivate high-performing executives. 100 Table of Contents Structure of Compensation Program Pay-for-Performance Pay-for-performance is the most significant structural element of Baxters compensation program. Annual performance against financial targets (adjusted EPS, adjusted sales and adjusted operating cash flow) drives the payout of cash bonuses. Baxters three-year growth in shareholder value relative to Baxters peer group and three-year performance against annual return on invested capital (ROIC) targets together determine the payout under 50% of Baxters annual equity awards to executive officers, which are granted in the form of performance share units. The overall performance of Baxters common stock determines the value of the remainder, which is granted in the form of stock options. The Baxter Compensation Committees assessment of how each officer performs his or her job impacts earned cash bonuses and equity awards. Baxters focus on pay-for-performance is best demonstrated through the structure of its executive compensation programs, where the majority of executive pay is at risk and subject to specific annual and long-term performance requirements. Financial Targets The Baxter Compensation Committee selected adjusted EPS, adjusted sales and adjusted operating cash flow as the financial measures on which to assess Baxters performance for purposes of funding the cash bonus pool. The relative weight assigned to each of these measures was 50%, 25%, and 25% respectively. If each financial measure is met in a given year, then the cash bonus pool is funded at two times the base salary for each executive officer covered by the bonus pool and negative discretion is applied as described below. These three financial metrics (adjusted EPS, adjusted sales and adjusted operating cash flow) were deemed appropriate by the Baxter Compensation Committee as they are of immediate interest to shareholders and are the primary measures as to which Baxter regularly provides guidance to the market. Adjusted EPS is the most heavily weighted measure, as the Baxter Compensation Committee believes it is a straightforward measure of Baxters current ability to generate value that is well understood by shareholders. Performance over the Long-Term As a healthcare company, Baxter operates in a rapidly changing, increasingly competitive and heavily regulated environment. Accordingly, encouraging its executive officers to focus on the long-term performance of Baxter is particularly important to Baxter. Historically, the payout of performance share units was based solely on Baxters growth in shareholder value relative to its peers. The performance share units that were awarded to the named executive officers in 2014 were designed to reward strong and sustained long-term performance by Baxter on two important measures: growth in shareholder value and ROIC. The ROIC measure was added to the performance share units in 2013 to provide a better balance compared to tying the award to a single performance metric. It also provides the opportunity to focus on a strategic financial component over a multi-year period. Finally, the use of multiple measures for performance share units is aligned with external market best practice. Performance Against Peers One-half of the performance share units awarded in 2014 were designed to reward strong long-term performance by Baxter relative to the companies in Baxters peer group. These healthcare companies are the primary companies with which Baxter competes for talent, investor capital and market position. The payout of shares of Baxter common stock resulting from the vesting of these performance share units will be based on Baxters change in total shareholder value versus the change in total shareholder value of the companies included in Baxters healthcare peer group during the three-year performance period commencing with the year in which the performance share units are awarded (January 1, 2014December 31, 2016). 101 Table of Contents Growth in shareholder value will be measured based on the following formula: Average Closing Stock Price Over the Last Twenty Days of the Performance Period minus Average Closing Stock Price Over the Last Twenty Days Immediately Preceding the Commencement of the Performance Period plus Reinvested Dividends Divided (÷) by Average Closing Stock Price Over the Last Twenty Days Immediately Preceding the Commencement of the Performance Period The performance share units will pay out in shares of Baxter common stock in a range of 0% to 200% of the number of performance share units awarded. The table below shows how Baxters growth in shareholder value against its peers correlates with the 0% to 200% range of payouts. Performance Payout Below 25(th) Percentile Rank 0 % 25(th) Percentile Rank 25 % 60(th) Percentile Rank 100 % 75(th) Percentile Rank 150 % 85(th) Percentile Rank or Above 200 % The performance share units will pay out linearly between each set of data points above the 25 th percentile and below the 85 th percentile. For example, if Baxter performs at a 40 th percentile rank, each named executive officer will receive the number of shares equal to 57% of his award of performance share units. In order to pay out at the 100% target level, Baxter must outperform its peers at the 60 th percentile. Performance Against ROIC ROIC is the strategic internal cash earnings measure that will determine the payout of shares of Baxter common stock for the other half of the performance share units awarded in 2014. ROIC measures how effectively Baxter is allocating and utilizing capital in its operations. The Baxter Compensation Committee selected ROIC as the second performance share unit measure in order to balance the Growth in Shareholder Value measure, helping to ensure a focus on efficient and value-maximizing investment and appropriate long-term management of capital. Improving ROIC requires disciplined management of working capital and is inherently challenging because of the measures focus on increasing cash flows relative to improved retained earnings. As Baxter becomes more profitable it becomes more difficult to show significant ROIC improvement due to the impact of increases in retained earnings on the denominator of the measurethat is, as the denominator grows Baxter is required to generate more cash flows from operations than in the prior year to improve its ROIC. ROIC is calculated by dividing cash flows from operations (excluding the impact of interest expense) by average invested capital. During the three-year performance period the Baxter Compensation Committee will set annual ROIC goals. The 2014 goal is intended to measure performance for both the first tranche of the 2014 ROIC performance share units and the second tranche of the 2013 ROIC performance share units. The performance share units that are tied to the ROIC goals will pay out in shares of Baxter common stock in a range of 0% to 200% of the number of performance share units awarded. The table below shows how Baxters ROIC performance correlates with the 0% to 200% range of payouts. Performance as a Percentage of Target Payout Below 93% 0 % 93% 25 % 100% 100 % 107% 200 % 102 Table of Contents Baxter does not provide guidance on ROIC nor does it disclose ROIC in its public filings. However, for years 2014, 2013 and 2012, Baxter achieved 102.5%, 100.6% and 108.8% of its respective ROIC targets. Performance Payout is At Risk As it is possible that there will be no payout under the performance share units, these awards are completely at-risk compensation. For example, Baxter did not issue any shares of common stock with respect to the performance share units granted in 2009 and payable in 2012 or granted in 2012 and payable in 2015 because Baxter did not achieve the threshold level of performance over the applicable three-year periods. This result is consistent with Baxters pay-for-performance philosophy and the Baxter Compensation Committees belief that a portion of equity granted to Baxters officers be completely at-risk. Additionally, the payouts of performance share awards in 2011 (2008 grant), 2013 (2010 grant) and 2014 (2011 grant) were 37%, 65% and 30%, respectively, of the original targets for those awards, demonstrating alignment with Baxters overall pay-for-performance philosophy. Performance of Baxter Common Stock The performance of Baxter common stock determines the value of the stock options and restricted stock units that have been granted to the named executive officers in 2014. Individual Performance The Baxter Compensation Committee (or the Baxter Board in the case of Baxters Chief Executive Officer) assesses the individual performance of each executive officer in making compensation decisions related to cash bonuses and equity awards. The Baxter Compensation Committees assessment of individual performance is inherently subjective and requires significant input from Baxters Chief Executive Officer. Essentially, the Baxter Compensation Committee assesses how well an officer fulfilled his or her obligations in the past year. This assessment focuses on how well the operations or function for which an officer is responsible performed during the year. One factor that the Baxter Compensation Committee considers in making assessments of individual performance is how well an officer performed against the performance goals set for such officer for the relevant year. The Baxter Chief Executive Officer reviews the performance goals and self-evaluations of each of the other executive officers and shares his insights and recommendations with the Baxter Compensation Committee. The goals set for each named executive officer for 2014 reflected the diversity of Baxters business and the wide range of responsibilities that are attributed to each of these officers. In evaluating each officers performance against his or her goals, consideration is given not only to whether an objective was met but most significantly how the objective was met including how appropriately the officer prioritized meeting an objective relative to the officers other responsibilities. Accordingly, the adjustments that are made to such officers compensation based on his or her performance are not directly correlated to the number of goals that an officer achieved. The Baxter Compensation Committee believes that this type of rigid correlation could motivate an officer to focus on achieving his or her performance goals rather than on fulfilling his or her job responsibilities in a manner that is in the best interests of Baxter and its shareholders. The Baxter Compensation Committee adjusts cash bonuses and equity grants for individual performance on a discretionary basis in light of the Baxter Compensation Committees overall assessment of how well an officer fulfilled his or her obligations to Baxter in the past year. Baxters Peer Group and Use of Peer Group Data Use of peer group data plays a significant role in the structure of the compensation program as it is a primary input in setting target levels for base salaries, cash bonuses and equity awards and helps to ensure that 103 Table of Contents compensation is market competitive in order to retain and attract talent. Baxter uses data from companies that the Baxter Compensation Committee has selected as comparable companies (collectively, the peer group) to help identify a reasonable starting point for base salaries, cash bonuses and equity awards and then analyzes both Baxter and individual performance to determine whether it is appropriate to move away from this baseline. Peer group data also plays a role in what non-cash compensation is paid to the named executive officers as the market data Baxter obtains regarding companies in its peer group helps determine what types and amounts of non-cash compensation are appropriate for competitive purposes. If data is not available for a particular officers position at Baxter, the Baxter Compensation Committee utilizes the information that is available to Aon Hewitt as well as internal equity principles to set an officers compensation targets at levels that are competitive with other officers at Baxter. Baxters use of peer group data is consistent among the named executive officers in that the baseline ( i.e. , percentile target) that is set for an element of compensation applies to all officers regardless of position. However, differences in the compensation paid to comparable officers at companies in the peer group do result in different target amounts for officers depending on their position. Baxters peer group includes all of the companies in the Standard & Poors 500 Health Care Index, except for distribution companies, insurance providers, hospitals, nursing homes, consultants and companies whose primary focus is not human health. As discussed above, information may not be available from each of the companies in Baxters peer group for every officer position. As a result, the number of companies in Baxters peer group may fluctuate as applied to each officer. As of December 31, 2014, the companies included in this peer group and that will therefore be used to determine the payout under one half of the performance share units granted in 2014, are set forth below. Abbott Laboratories Covidien Plc PerkinElmer, Inc. AbbVie Inc. C.R. Bard, Inc. Perrigo Company Plc Actavis plc DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc. Pfizer Inc. Agilent Technologies, Inc. DENTSPLY International Inc. Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Allergan, Inc. Eli Lilly and Company St. Jude Medical, Inc. Amgen Inc. Gilead Sciences, Inc. Stryker Corporation Becton, Dickinson and Company Hospira, Inc. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Biogen Idec Inc. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Boston Scientific Corporation Johnson & Johnson Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings Waters Corporation CareFusion Corporation Medtronic, Inc. Zimmer Holdings, Inc. Celgene Corporation Merck & Co., Inc. Cerner Corporation Mylan Inc. The median revenue and market capitalization for these companies is approximately $7.3 billion and $27.7 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, Baxters revenue of $16.7 billion was above the 75 th percentile and market capitalization of $39.7 billion was just below the 60 th percentile of the peer group. Elements of Executive Compensation Base Salaries Base salaries are paid in order to provide a fixed component of compensation for the named executive officers. For each of the last three years, base salary target levels for all named executive officers were set within a range that is competitive with the 50 th percentile of salaries paid to comparable officers at companies in the peer group. The Baxter Compensation Committee selected the 50 th percentile as the positioning for base salaries because, as they are the only fixed component of compensation, they are less appropriately used to motivate performance and thus the Baxter Compensation Committee determined to set them at a reasonably competitive mid-point. 104 Table of Contents The Baxter Compensation Committee sets actual individual base salaries higher or lower than targeted base salaries for any reason that the Baxter Compensation Committee deems relevant. Factors that the Baxter Compensation Committee considered for 2014 base salaries included how long an officer has been at Baxter and in his or her current role, the impact of his or her position on Baxters results, the quality of the overall experience an officer brings to his or her role and how the officers role fits within the structure of the organization. Base salaries for all of the named executive officers were generally competitive with the 50 th percentile of salaries paid to comparable officers in the peer group. In August of 2014, Dr. Hantsons base salary was further increased from $765,000 to $950,000 in recognition of his designation as the future CEO of Baxalta. Cash Bonuses Cash bonuses are intended to reward both Baxter and individual performance by providing officers with an opportunity to receive additional cash compensation based on both Baxters performance relative to the financial targets described above and the Baxter Compensation Committees assessment of how well an officer performed his or her role during the applicable year. In assessing an individual officers performance, the Baxter Compensation Committee considers the individuals present and potential contribution to Baxter, in addition to various performance criteria which include, but are not limited to, implementation of critical projects ( e.g. , acquisitions or divestitures), product development, regulatory or quality performance and innovation or research goals. Baxter believes it is important to consider an individuals performance in assessing compensation and not just Baxters overall performance relative to the financial targets discussed above. In addition, cash bonuses may be periodically used by Baxter for recruitment purposes in order to competitively compensate and attract high performing executives. Target Setting For each of the last three years, cash bonus targets for all named executive officers were set within a range that is competitive with cash bonuses paid to comparable officers at companies in Baxters peer group. The Baxter Compensation Committee has the discretion to adjust each officers target as it deems appropriate. Typical reasons for adjusting cash bonus targets are how long an officer has been in his or her current role and how the officers role fits within the structure of the organization. Determination of 2014 Annual Bonus Payouts Based on Baxters performance against its 2014 financial targets, the bonus pool was funded at 1.92 times the base salary for each executive officer covered by the bonus pool. The Baxter Compensation Committee then has the ability to use negative discretion to determine the actual cash bonus amount paid to each named executive officer. Any negative discretion takes into account the Baxter Compensation Committees view of how well each officer performed his or her responsibilities during 2014. As a result, the actual cash bonus paid to each named executive officer was calculated using the following formula: (x) the product of such officers cash bonus target multiplied by (y) Baxter performance adjustment percentage (see description immediately below under Company Performance) multiplied by (z) such officers individual performance adjustment percentage as determined by the Baxter Compensation Committee. Company Performance . As discussed above, Baxter performed relative to its adjusted EPS, adjusted sales and adjusted operating cash flow financial targets for 2014 at 101.2%, 102.2% and 97.8%, respectively. Given the relative weighting of these targets (50%, 25% and 25%, respectively) and the associated funding schedule for each metric, this performance translated into an adjustment to each officers cash bonus of 111% of target. The funding schedule associated with each metric ranges from 0% to 150% with the baseline for each metric being 100% ( i.e. , Baxter must achieve a given financial target for the funding for such metric to be 100% and funding 105 Table of Contents can range from 0% to 150%). The band of funding around the baseline varies by metric. This variation reflects the probability of achievement of a given target based on historical performance data as well as the scope of the given metric. Accordingly, the adjustment for 2014 performance of 111% was higher than the adjustment of 103% for 2013 performance, which was in turn lower than the adjustment of 116% for 2012 performance, based on how Baxter performed against its financial targets in each respective year and the relative weighting of, and funding schedule associated with, each metric. The fluctuation from year to year in these adjustments based on actual company performance against specific financial targets is consistent with Baxters pay-for-performance philosophy. Individual Performance . Based on the Baxter Compensation Committees assessment of the performance of each officer of Baxter, each officers cash bonus target was adjusted further in a range of 100% to 130% of target. Dr. Hantson was paid a cash bonus of $1,370,850, which included an upward individual adjustment of 130% of target. This adjustment reflects the leadership provided to and the performance of the BioScience business in 2014. Mr. Hombach was paid a cash bonus of $1,049,061, which included an upward individual adjustment of 130% of target. This adjustment primarily reflects the financial performance of Baxter in 2014 as well as Mr. Hombachs leadership with respect to the companys finance function and within the organization. The Baxter Compensation Committee believes that the methodology it uses in paying cash bonuses is consistent with providing compensation that reflects how an officer is valued within Baxter and the marketplace. Spin-Off Retention Bonus . As Baxter works toward a successful transition plan to create two new independent companies, retaining senior leadership talent through and after the transition date is critical to both the execution of the plan and business continuity. Mr. Hombach is eligible for a cash bonus with a target of $750,000 in connection with the planned separation of Baxter and Baxalta. Payment is conditioned on the successful close of the spin-off of Baxalta and can range between 75% to 150% of the target amount based on milestone achievements. Equity Awards Equity awards are the most significant components of each named executive officers compensation package. Baxters compensation program emphasizes equity awards to motivate executive officers to drive the long-term performance of Baxter and to align their interests with those of Baxters shareholders. This emphasis is appropriate as these officers have the greatest role in establishing Baxters direction and should have the greatest proportion of their compensation aligned with the long-term interests of shareholders. This alignment is furthered by requiring officers to satisfy the stock ownership guidelines discussed below under Baxters Stock Ownership Guidelines for Executive Officers; Prohibitions on Trading. Structure of Equity Compensation Program Baxters equity compensation program for named executive officers provides for annual grants in equal proportion of performance share units and stock options. Performance share units are provided to reflect the Baxter Compensation Committees belief that as the recipients of these awards have the most responsibility for Baxters performance, the payout of a portion of their equity awards should be completely at-risk. Stock options compose the balance of the annual equity grant to recognize that it is in the best interests of Baxter to provide a certain amount of equity that will vest as long as the officer continues to serve at Baxter. There are factors beyond the control of the officers that affect Baxters performance as measured against its peers or otherwise, and equity awards that are not subject to performance metrics but only vest over time provide greater stability in compensation and will only have value so long as Baxters stock price continues to increase from the date of grant. Baxter also periodically grants equity to named executive officers for recognition, recruitment and retention purposes, and as discussed above, utilizes equity as a primary vehicle to attract high performing executives. Individual Equity Grants In order to determine the size of equity grants to be awarded to each named executive officer in connection with the annual grant process in March 2014, the Baxter Compensation Committee reviewed market data on how 106 Table of Contents much equity similarly situated officers were receiving at companies in Baxters peer group. This review focused on how much equity should be granted to each officer in order to be competitive with similarly situated officers at companies in Baxters peer group. The Baxter Compensation Committee set targets that were competitive with the peer group for each of the named executive officers. In determining the actual amount of each officers equity grant, the Baxter Compensation Committee then used its discretion to adjust 2014 target equity grants for Baxters officers across a range of 100% to 150%. With respect to the Baxalta named executive officers, the 2014 target equity grants were adjusted as follows: Dr. Hantson, 100% and Mr. Hombach, 100%. These adjustments were made primarily to reflect the Baxter Compensation Committees assessment of such officers individual performance during 2013 and future potential. Spin-Off Retention Restricted Stock Units As Baxter works toward a successful transition plan to create two new independent companies, retaining senior leadership talent through and after the transition date is critical to both the execution of the plan and business continuity. Certain Baxalta executive officers received a grant of restricted stock units in connection with the planned separation of Baxter and Baxalta, including Mr. Hombach in the amount of 40,000 units. The grants will vest on the earlier of the third anniversary of the grant date or involuntary termination of employment, other than for cause. Perquisites Baxter provides a very limited range of perquisites to its named executive officers. Baxter permits limited personal travel on company aircraft due to the potential efficiencies associated with such use. All personal aircraft usage must be pre-approved by the Chief Executive Officer and any such aircraft usage, including by the Chief Executive Officer, is reviewed annually by the Board. Baxter reimburses business-related travel and other related entertainment and incidental costs for executive officers and their significant others when such executive officers are invited to attend Board meetings or other business-related activities where the attendance of a significant other is expected. Baxter pays these expenses and costs as the business purpose served is closely related to the benefits received. Baxter also pays for an annual physical exam for executive officers and believes this practice to be in the best interests of Baxter and its shareholders as the health of an executive officer is critical to an officers performance. In 2014, the aggregate incremental cost associated with providing these perquisites was less than $10,000 for each named executive officer. Retirement and Other Benefits Baxters named executive officers hired prior to December 31, 2006, including Mr. Hombach, participate in Baxters pension and supplemental pension plans to the same extent and on the same terms as any other eligible employee. Dr. Hantson is not eligible to participate in Baxters pension and supplemental pension plans as such plans were closed to new participants as of December 31, 2006. Employees hired or rehired after that date, including Dr. Hantson, receive an additional employer contribution equal to 3% of his or her compensation in Baxters tax-qualified Section 401(k) plan and nonqualified deferred compensation plan if his or her compensation exceeds the compensation that can be taken into account under Baxters 401(k) plan. Each of the named executive officers is eligible to participate in Baxters deferred compensation plan, which permits the officer to defer the receipt of covered compensation and receive a 3.5% company match. Baxter allows named executive officers to participate in a deferred compensation plan in order to provide a market competitive plan as well as to facilitate retirement savings as part of the total compensation program in a cost- and tax-effective way for Baxter. Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices With the assistance of the Baxter Compensation Committees independent compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co. Inc., the Baxter Compensation Committee reviewed Baxters material compensation 107 Table of Contents policies and practices applicable to its employees, including its executive officers, and concluded that these policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Baxter. The key features of the executive compensation program that support this conclusion include:  appropriate pay philosophy, peer group and market positioning;  effective balance in cash and equity mix, short- and long-term focus, corporate, business unit and individual performance focus and financial and non-financial performance measurement and discretion; and  meaningful risk mitigants, such as the stock ownership guidelines and executive compensation recoupment policy discussed below. Baxters Stock Ownership Guidelines for Executive Officers; Prohibitions on Trading In order to drive the long-term performance of Baxter, Baxters executive officers are required to own a certain amount of Baxter stock. Each of Baxters executive officers (other than Baxters Chief Executive Officer) is required to achieve ownership of Baxter common stock valued at a minimum of four times annual base salary, in each case within five years of becoming an executive officer. This requirement, like the executive compensation recoupment policy discussed below, helps ensure long-term focus and appropriate levels of risk-taking by Baxters executive officers. Pursuant to Baxters securities trading policy, officers and certain other employees, including all named executive officers, are prohibited from engaging in short-term trading activities and option transactions in Baxter stock. As a result, such persons cannot enter into any put or call options or otherwise buy or sell derivatives on any Baxter stock. Additionally, it is Baxters policy to not permit officers to pledge Baxter stock as collateral for loans or otherwise as a security interest. Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy Baxter has an executive compensation recoupment policy that applies to all cash bonuses paid by Baxter under its incentive plans and all grants of equity awarded by Baxter to any person designated as an officer by the Board. Following any restatement of Baxters financial results that requires an amendment to any previously filed results or if an officer violates a restrictive covenant contained in any agreement between Baxter and such officer, the Board will review the facts and circumstances that led to the requirement for the restatement or the violation and take any actions it deems appropriate with respect to executive incentive compensation. With respect to a restatement, the Board will consider whether an officer received compensation based on performance reported, but not actually achieved, or was accountable for the events that led to the restatement, including any misconduct. Actions the Board may take include: recovery, reduction or forfeiture of all or part of any bonus, equity or other compensation previously provided or to be provided in the future; disciplinary actions; and the pursuit of any other remedies. Post-Termination Compensation Baxters named executive officers may receive certain payments if Baxter undergoes a change in control and the officer ceases to be employed by Baxter under their employment agreements or severance agreements, as applicable. Providing for payments in a change in control situation is consistent with market practice and helps ensure that if a change in control is in the best interest of the shareholders, officers have appropriate incentives to remain focused on their responsibilities before, during and after the transaction without undue concern for their personal circumstances. In consideration for these benefits, Baxters named executive officers have agreed to be bound for two years from the date of their respective termination to non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disparagement covenants. The Baxter named executive officers severance benefits were not a significant factor in determining their other compensation elements because the Baxter Compensation Committee did not believe that such benefits, as provided, exceeded market practices of peer companies in a way that justified a reduction in any other elements or vice versa None of the named executive officers is entitled to any excise tax gross-up covering such officers change in control benefits. 108 Table of Contents Following Baxters announcement of its plan to separate into two new independent companies, the Board approved a severance agreement with Mr. Hombach, the terms of which are described below. Effects of the Separation on Outstanding Executive Compensation Awards; Baxalta Compensation The separation is not a change in control and therefore will not entitle Baxalta officers to any change in control benefits; however, in connection with the separation, certain Baxalta executive officers, including Mr. Hombach, have entered into or will enter into severance agreements with Baxter that will become obligations of Baxalta upon completion of the separation and distribution. See Baxalta Executive Severance Agreements. Equity-Based Compensation Concurrently with the distribution, and notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary (including the more general discussion of Baxters equity-based compensation awards presented in the Executive Compensation Tables discussion herein), holders of Baxter stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units, in each case to the extent granted prior to January 1, 2015 and whether vested or unvested, will generally receive both adjusted Baxter awards and Baxalta awards, subject only to limited exceptions. Baxter stock options and restricted stock units granted on or after January 1, 2015, whether vested or unvested, will generally be adjusted into corresponding awards of either Baxter or Baxalta equity based on which company will employ the employee holding such awards following the separation, and be subject to the original vesting schedule, subject only to limited exceptions. Similarly, employees who hold unrestricted common stock of Baxter acquired through past equity awards or otherwise will be treated like all other Baxter shareholders in the distribution. See also Certain Relationships and Related Person TransactionsAgreements with BaxterEmployee Matters Agreement. Baxalta Compensation Programs Baxalta believes that the Baxter executive compensation programs are effective both at retaining and motivating officers and competitive with compensation programs at peer companies. Baxalta expects the executive compensation programs that will initially be adopted by Baxalta will be very similar to those in place at Baxter immediately prior to the distribution. However, after the distribution, the Baxalta Compensation Committee will continue to evaluate Baxaltas compensation and benefit programs and may make adjustments as necessary to meet prevailing business needs. Baxalta Executive Severance Agreements In connection with the separation, certain Baxalta executive officers, including Mr. Hombach, have entered into or will enter into severance agreements with Baxter that will become obligations of Baxalta upon completion of the distribution. The executive severance agreements provide for payments to the executive officer if such executive officers employment is terminated by Baxalta without cause (as defined in the executive severance agreement) prior to the first anniversary of the distribution date. In such event, the payments include a lump sum payment equal to 1.5 times the executive officers salary and target bonus, a lump sum payment covering six months of cost-sharing for health insurance coverage and outplacement expense reimbursement in an amount not exceeding $50,000. Such agreements are consistent with market practice and help ensure that senior leadership talent is retained through and after the transition date, which is critical for both the execution of the plan and business continuity. For the avoidance of doubt, the Potential Payments Upon Termination Following A Change in Control table and related discussion below is applicable only to the executive severance agreements entered into with Baxter and in existence as of the end of 2014. 109 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Tables The following executive compensation tables show compensation provided by Baxter to Ludwig N. Hantson, Ph.D., who is expected to serve as Baxaltas President and Chief Executive Officer, and Robert J. Hombach, who is expected to serve as Baxaltas Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations Officer. Both Dr. Hantson and Mr. Hombach were named executive officers of Baxter in 2014. They also include the 2014 compensation provided by Baxter for Brian Goff, who is expected to serve as Baxaltas Executive Vice President and President, Hematology, Dagmar Rosa-Björkeson, who is expected to serve as Baxaltas Executive Vice President and President, Biosimilars, and Patrice Zagame, who is expected to serve as Baxaltas Executive Vice President and President, Intercontinental. The following tables reflect compensation arrangements in 2012, 2013 and 2014 with Baxter only, and they do not reflect the compensation arrangements with Baxalta or the effects of the separation and distribution on outstanding executive compensation awards, including the impact of the separation and distribution on outstanding performance-based awards. See Executive CompensationEffects of the Separation on Outstanding Executive Compensation Awards; Baxalta Compensation. Summary Compensation Table The following table shows for the years indicated below the compensation provided to Baxaltas named executive officers by Baxter.

Ms. Rosa-Björkeson was paid a $1,000,000 one-time signing bonus in 2014, which she elected to defer pursuant to Baxters deferred compensation plan, which is further discussed under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table below. Dr. Zagame was paid a one-time signing bonus of $795,000 in 2014. If either of Ms. Rosa-Björkeson or Dr. Zagame resigns from Baxalta within 12 months of their respective start dates, he or she will be responsible for 100% re-payment of any bonus paid, and if either resigns within 24 months, he or she will be responsible for 50% re-payment of any bonus paid. (2) Amounts shown in this column represent the value of performance share and restricted stock units granted under Baxters equity compensation program, including the Spin-Off Retention RSU Grants for Messrs. Hombach and Goff. All amounts are valued based on the grant date fair value computed in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Stock Compensation (FASB ASC Topic 718). The grant date fair value of the maximum amount of shares payable under the performance share units granted in 2014 is as follows: Dr. Hantson ($1,945,220); Mr. Hombach ($1,833,944); and Mr. Goff ($304,818). For more information on how these amounts are calculated, please see Note 10 to the audited combined financial statements. Dividend equivalents accrue on the performance share and restricted stock units and are paid only if the underlying awards vest. For further information on these awards, see the 2014 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table and the accompanying narrative set forth in Description of Certain Awards Granted in 2014. 110 Table of Contents (3) Amounts shown in this column represent the value of stock options granted under Baxters equity compensation program based on the grant date fair value computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. For more information on how these amounts are calculated, please see Note 10 to the audited combined financial statements. For further information on these awards, set forth in 2014 Grants of Plan-Based Awards. (4) Amounts shown in this column represent cash bonuses paid for performance in the applicable year under Baxters officer bonus program. The methodology applied in determining the bonus amounts earned by the Dr. Hantson and Mr. Hombach is discussed in Compensation Discussion and AnalysisElements of Executive CompensationCash Bonuses. Amounts for Mr. Goff, Ms. Rosa-Björkeson and Dr. Zagame were determined by Baxter Management. (5) Amounts shown in this column represent the aggregate of the increase in actuarial values of each of the named executive officers benefits under Baxters pension plan and supplemental pension plan. As discussed below in connection with the Pension Benefits table, only Mr. Hombach is eligible to participate in Baxters pension and supplemental pension plans as the other named executive officers all joined Baxter after December 31, 2006.

There is no threshold amount for cash bonuses. Even if Baxter meets each financial target, the Baxter Compensation Committee may use negative discretion and decline to pay an officer a bonus for his or her performance. Consistent with the bonus program and under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the maximum bonus that could be paid to any officer for 2014 performance was the lesser of (i) two times an officers salary and (ii) $5 million. The actual cash bonus paid to each named executive officer for his 2014 performance is reported as Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation above in the Summary Compensation Table. (2) Fifty percent of the performance share units granted in March 2014 will be paid out in shares of Baxter common stock based on Baxters change in total shareholder value versus the change in total shareholder value of the companies included in Baxters healthcare peer group during the three-year performance period commencing with the year in which the performance share units are awarded, which for this grant is January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016 (GSV PSUs). The amounts set forth under Threshold, Target and Maximum represent the number of shares of common stock that would be paid out under the GSV PSUs if Baxters growth in shareholder value compared to the growth in shareholder value of the companies in its peer group is at the 25 th , 60 th and 85 th percentile, respectively. For more information on how these payouts are determined, please see Compensation Discussion and AnalysisStructure of Compensation ProgramPerformance over the Long-TermPerformance Against Peers. (3) Fifty percent of the performance share units granted in March 2014 will be paid out in shares of Baxter common stock based on the achievement of annual ROIC goals over the three-year performance period commencing with the year in which the performance share units are awarded, which for this grant is January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016 (ROIC PSUs). The amounts set forth under Threshold, Target and Maximum represent the number of shares of common stock that would be paid out under the first of the three ROIC performance periods of the ROIC PSUs if Baxters annual ROIC goal for 2014 meets 93%, 100% and 107% of the target, respectively. The remaining two-thirds of the ROIC PSUs, which are based on the achievement of annual ROIC goals in 2015 and 2016, are not included in the above table because they are not considered granted for accounting 112 Table of Contents purposes until the ROIC goals are set for those years. For more information on how these payouts are determined, please see Compensation Discussion and AnalysisStructure of Compensation ProgramPerformance over the Long-TermPerformance Against ROIC. (4) Fifty percent of the performance share units granted in March 2013 will be paid out in shares of Baxter common stock based on the achievement of annual ROIC goals over the three-year performance period commencing with the year in which the performance share units are awarded, which for this grant is January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015 (ROIC PSUs). The amounts set forth under Threshold, Target and Maximum represent the number of shares of common stock that would be paid out under the second of the three ROIC performance periods of the ROIC PSUs if Baxters annual ROIC goal for 2014 meets 93%, 100% and 107% of the target, respectively. The remaining one-third of the ROIC PSUs, which is based on the achievement of annual ROIC goals in 2015, is not included in the above table because it is not considered granted for accounting purposes until the ROIC goals are set for the year. For more information on how these payouts are determined, please see Compensation Discussion and AnalysisStructure of Compensation ProgramPerformance over the Long-TermPerformance Against ROIC. (5) The amounts shown represent the target retention bonus made relating to the separation of Baxter and Baxalta. Payment is conditioned on the successful close of the spin-off of Baxalta. Individuals can receive between 75% to 150% of the target amount based on milestone achievements. Please see Compensation Discussion and AnalysisStructure of Compensation ProgramSpin-Off Retention Bonus. (6) The amounts shown represent retention restricted stock unit grants relating to the separation of Baxter and Baxalta. The grants will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and would accelerate in the event of an involuntary termination (except for cause). Please see Compensation Discussion and AnalysisElements of Executive CompensationEquity AwardsSpin-Off Retention RSU Grants. (7) Represents the grant date fair value computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 of the restricted stock units and the target amount of performance share units awarded under Baxters equity compensation program during 2014 and are further described immediately below under Description of Certain Awards Granted in 2014. Description of Certain Awards Granted in 2014 Performance Share Units. Dr. Hantson and Messrs. Hombach and Goff received a performance share unit grant in March 2014, which was divided into two equal tranches. The payout of shares of Baxter common stock will range from 0% to 200% of the number of performance share units awarded. The first of these tranches, the GSV PSUs, has a payout amount determined by Baxters growth in shareholder value relative to the growth in shareholder value of the healthcare peers included in Baxters peer group during the three-year performance period commencing on January 1, 2014. The second of these tranches, the ROIC PSUs, has a payout amount based on the achievement of annual ROIC goals over the three-year performance period commencing on January 1, 2014. The threshold, target and maximum payouts that each officer could receive under his award that are currently determinable are disclosed under the Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards column in the 2014 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table above. These numbers include the first of the three ROIC PSU performance periods for the 2014 PSU Grant and the second of the three ROIC performance periods for the 2013 PSU Grant. If an officer ceases to be employed during the performance period (other than due to death, disability or retirement), such officer will forfeit any payout under both the GSV PSUs and the ROIC PSUs (together referred to as the PSUs). If an officer who is retirement eligible (meaning such officer is at least 65 years of age, or at least 55 years of age with at least 10 years of service) retires after December 31, 2014, then such officers PSUs will remain eligible for payout at the end of the performance period. If an officers employment terminates due to death or disability after December 31, 2014, such officers PSUs will pay out within 60 days at 100% of the target grant. Officers have no rights of a shareholder with respect to the PSUs until the performance period is complete, other than with respect to dividend equivalents which accrue to the same extent as if such unit was a share of common stock during the performance period. Such accrued dividend equivalents will be paid out in common stock when and if the related shares of common stock are paid out at the end of the performance period. For more information about these awards, see Compensation Discussion and AnalysisStructure of Compensation ProgramPerformance over the Long-Term. Stock Options. Dr. Hantson and Messrs. Hombach and Goff received a stock option grant in connection with Baxters annual equity award process in March 2014. Ms. Rosa-Björkeson and Dr. Zagame each received a grant of stock options in December 2014 following the beginning of their employment with Baxter, which reflect amounts intended to compensate them for unvested equity awards at their previous employers. All stock options granted in 2014 vest one-third per year over a three-year period, starting on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The exercise price of each stock option awarded by Baxter to its executive officers under Baxters incentive compensation programs is the closing price of Baxters common stock on the date of grant. Generally, if an officer ceases to be employed before his or her stock options vest, these options will expire on the date such officers employment is terminated unless such termination is due to death, disability or retirement. If an officer who is retirement eligible (as defined above) retires 113 Table of Contents after December 31, 2014, then such officers stock options will continue to vest based upon their original vesting schedule and expire on the fifth anniversary of the termination date. If an officers employment terminates due to death or disability after December 31, 2014, such officers options will vest immediately and expire five years later. Each of these options expires on the ten-year anniversary of the grant date. These grants are reflected in the All Other Option Awards: Number of Securities Underlying Options column in the 2014 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table above. Spin-Off Retention Restricted Stock Units. Mr. Hombach and Mr. Goff each received a grant of restricted stock units in connection with the planned separation of Baxter and Baxalta. The grant amounts are: Mr. Hombach, 40,000 and Mr. Goff, 3,000. The grants will vest on the earlier of the third anniversary of the grant date or involuntary termination of employment, unless employment is terminated for cause. These grants are reflected in the All Other Option Awards: Number of Shares of Stock or Units column in the 2014 Grants of Plan-Based Awards. Other Restricted Stock Units. Certain of Baxaltas named executive officers received a grant of restricted stock units not related to the spin-off retention efforts. Mr. Goff received a grant of restricted stock units in connection with Baxters annual equity award process in March 2014. Ms. Rosa-Björkeson and Dr. Zagame each received a grant of restricted stock units in December 2014 following the beginning of their employment with Baxter, which reflect amounts intended to compensate them for unvested equity awards at their previous employers. All such restricted stock units granted in 2014 vest one-third per year over a three-year period, starting on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Generally, if an officer ceases to be employed at Baxter before his or her restricted stock units vest, these restricted stock units will expire on the date such officers employment is terminated unless such termination is due to death, disability or retirement. If an officer who is retirement eligible (as defined above) retires after December 31, 2014, then such officers restricted stock units will continue to vest based upon their original vesting schedule. If an officers employment terminates due to death or disability after December 31, 2014, such officers restricted stock units will vest immediately. These grants are reflected in the All Other Option Awards: Number of Shares of Stock or Units column in the 2014 Grants of Plan-Based Awards. 114 Table of Contents Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End Option Awards Stock Awards Name Number of Securities Underlying Unexercised Options (#) Exercisable Number of Securities Underlying Unexercised Options (#) Unexercisable (1) Option Exercise Price ($) Option Expiration Date Number of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested (#)(2) Market Value of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested ($)(2) Performance Period and PSU Type (3)(4) Equity Incentive Plan Awards: Number of Unearned Shares, Units or Other Rights That Have Not Vested (#)(3)(4) Equity Incentive Plan Awards: Market or Payout Value of Unearned Shares, Units or Other Rights That Have Not Vested ($)(3)(4) Dr. Hantson 84,367 53.80 3/4/2021 65,792 4,821,896 2012 2014 (G) 5,523 404,781 59,064 29,533 57.48 3/4/2022 2013 2015 (G) 3,172 232,476 39,651 79,302 70.24 3/3/2023 2014 2016 (G) 2,210 161,971 103,181 69.03 3/4/2024 2013 (R) 8,459 619,960 2014 (R) 5,892 431,825 Mr. Hombach 49,628 53.80 3/4/2021 44,153 3,235,973 2012 2014 (G) 5,523 404,781 59,064 29,533 57.48 3/4/2022 2013 2015 (G) 2,538 186,010 31,721 63,442 70.24 3/3/2023 2014 2016 (G) 2,210 161,971 103,181 69.03 3/4/2024 2013 (R) 6,767 495,953 2014 (R) 5,892 431,825 Mr. Goff 23,666 13,334 50.17 6/1/2022 11,156 817,623 2013 2015 (G) 344 25,212 8,591 17,182 70.24 3/3/2023 2014 2016 (G) 389 28,510 31,376 69.03 3/4/2024 2013 (R) 2,748 201,401 2014 (R) 3,114 228,225 Ms. Rosa-Björkeson 40,000 72.87 11/29/2024 25,000 1,832,250 Dr. Zagame 50,000 72.87 11/29/2024 25,000 1,832,250 (1) The chart below represents stock options vesting as follows: Name March 2015 March 2016 March 2017 Hantson 103,577 74,045 34,394 Hombach 95,647 66,115 34,394 Goff 32,383 19,050 10,459 December 2015 December 2016 December 2017 Rosa-Björkeson 13,333 13,333 13,334 Zagame 16,666 16,667 16,667 (2) The amounts in the columns represent restricted stock unit awards and earned but unvested PSUs from the 2013 PSU grant relating to the 2013 ROIC performance period. The earned but unvested PSUs will vest in January 2016. Specifically, the amounts in the columns for Dr. Hantson reflect (i) 6,900 unvested restricted stock units remaining under his 2010 grant, which will vest on June 1, 2015; and (ii) 50,000 restricted stock units which will vest in three equal annual installments beginning in June 2017. The amounts in the columns for Mr. Hombach reflect 40,000 restricted stock units that will vest in June 2017. The amounts in the columns for Mr. Goff reflect (i) 5,076 restricted stock units that will vest in March 2015; (ii) 1,743 restricted stock units that will vest in March 2016; (iii) 930 restricted stock units that will vest in March 2017; and (iv) 3,000 restricted stock units that will vest in September 2017. The amounts in the columns for Ms. Rosa-Björkeson and Dr. Zagame reflect restricted stock units granted in December 2014 that will vest in equal installments on the anniversary of the grant date over three years. Amounts shown in the columns also include the dividend shares accrued on the restricted stock units granted to each of the named executive officers. The market value of these unvested restricted stock units is based on the closing price of Baxter common stock on December 31, 2014 ($73.29). 115 Table of Contents (3) For the grants noted with a (G) in the eighth column, amounts represent the threshold number and value of shares of common stock that an officer would receive under the GSV PSUs granted for the 2012-2014, 2013-2015 and 2014-2016 performance periods. The market value of the performance share units included in these columns is based on the closing price of Baxter common stock on December 31, 2014 ($73.29). Amounts in these columns also include the dividend shares accrued on the performance share units. With respect to the GSV PSUs granted for the 2012-2014 performance period, the final award was paid out on February 11, 2015 at 0% of target. Final payouts under the GSV PSUs for the 2013-2015 and 2014-2016 performance periods will not be known until the respective performance period is completed, and therefore it is possible that no shares of common stock will be paid out under these GSV PSUs. For more information on how payouts under the GSV PSUs are determined, please see Compensation Discussion and Analysis Structure of Compensation ProgramPerformance over the Long-TermPerformance Against Peers. (4) For the grants noted with an (R) in the eighth column, amounts represent the maximum number and value of shares of common stock that an officer would receive under the ROIC PSUs granted in 2014. The market value of the performance share units included in these columns is based on the closing price of Baxter common stock on December 31, 2014 ($73.29). Amounts in these columns also include the dividend shares accrued on the performance share units. With respect to the 2014 performance period, which is the first of the three annual ROIC performance periods for the ROIC PSUs granted in 2014 and the second of the three annual ROIC performance periods for the ROIC PSUs granted in 2013, the final award was earned at 136% of target. However these earned ROIC PSUs will not pay out until 2017 (2014 grants) and 2016 (2013 grants), when all three annual ROIC performance periods related to the ROIC PSUs granted in 2014 and 2013 have been completed, and it is possible that no shares of common stock will be earned with regard to the remaining annual performance periods if the established targets are not met for those periods.

The present values of the accrued benefits disclosed in the table above are based on the following assumptions: Assumption Value Discount Rate 4.00% Postretirement Mortality Retirement Plan 2014, adjusted to reflect past experience Termination/Disability None assumed Retirement Age Earlier of age 65 or attainment of 85 points Other assumptions not explicitly mentioned are the same as those assumptions used for financial reporting. Please refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Baxters Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 for more information on those assumptions. (2) Aside from Mr. Hombach, all other named executive officers of Baxalta are not eligible to participate in either the pension or supplemental pension plan as they joined Baxter after these plans were closed as of December 31, 2006. Instead, they receive an additional employer contribution equal to 3% of their compensation in Baxters tax-qualified Section 401(k) plan and nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Baxters tax-qualified pension plan is a broad-based retirement income plan. The normal retirement (age 65) benefit equals (i) 1.75 percent of a participants Final Average Pay multiplied by the participants number of years of pension plan participation, minus (ii) 1.75 percent of a participants estimated primary social security benefit, multiplied by the participants years of pension plan participation. Final Average Pay is equal to the average of a participants five highest consecutive calendar years of earnings out of his or her last ten calendar years of earnings. In general, the compensation considered in determining the pension payable to the named executive officer includes salary and cash bonuses awarded under the officer bonus program. Although age 65 is the normal retirement age under the pension plan, the pension plan has early retirement provisions based on a 117 Table of Contents point system. Under the point system, each participant is awarded one point for each year of pension plan participation and one point for each year of age. Participants who terminate employment after accumulating at least 65 points, and who wait to begin receiving their pension plan benefits until they have 85 points, receive an unreduced pension plan benefit regardless of their actual age when they begin receiving their pension plan benefits. Baxters supplemental pension plan is offered to provide a benefit for the amount of eligible compensation that is disallowed as pensionable earnings under the pension plan pursuant to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, that limit the benefit available to highly compensated employees under qualified pension plans. Accordingly, this plan is available to all employees eligible to participate in the pension plan whose benefit under the pension plan is limited by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If the present value of the benefit exceeds $50,000, the participant will be paid in an annuity commencing when the participant is first eligible for early retirement, regardless of whether the participant elects to commence his or her qualified plan benefit at that time. As permitted by the transitional rules under the tax regulations referred to above, persons who were participants in the plan at the end of 2007 were given a one-time option to elect a different commencement date. Deferred salary and bonus amounts that may not be included under the pension plan are included in the supplemental plan. Participation in the pension and supplemental pension plans was closed as of December 31, 2006. Any employees hired or rehired after that date are not be eligible to participate in the pension plan or supplemental pension plan, but instead receive an additional employer contribution equal to 3% of his or her compensation in Baxters tax-qualified Section 401(k) plan (and nonqualified deferred compensation plan if his or her compensation exceeds the compensation that can be taken into account under Baxters 401(k) plan).

(3) Amounts in this column are not included in the Summary Compensation Table as Baxters deferred compensation plan provides participants with a subset of investment elections available to all eligible employees under Baxters tax-qualified Section 401(k) plan. A participant in Baxters deferred compensation plan may elect to defer a portion of his or her eligible compensation (up to 50% of base salary and up to 100% of eligible bonus) during the calendar year as long as the participant makes such election prior to the beginning of the calendar year. For named executive officers, eligible compensation under the deferred compensation plan includes a participants base salary and any annual cash bonus. Participants in the deferred compensation plan may select from a subset of investment elections available to all eligible employees under Baxters tax-qualified Section 401(k) plan. Amounts in a participants account are adjusted on a daily basis upward or downward to reflect the investment return that would have been realized had such amounts been invested in the investments selected by the participant. Participants may elect to change their investment elections once each calendar month. Baxter is also required to match contributions to the deferred compensation plan dollar-for-dollar up to 3.5% of a participants eligible compensation. Any participant who 118 Table of Contents either was hired after December 31, 2006, or elected as of January 1, 2008 not to continue to accrue benefits in the pension plan, receives a company contribution equal to 3.0% of his or her eligible compensation in excess of the compensation that is recognized in the tax-qualified Section 401(k) plan, regardless of whether the participant is otherwise eligible to elect to defer a portion of his or her compensation. Deferrals under the plan are not recognized as eligible compensation for the qualified pension plan (but are recognized in the supplemental pension plan) or in calculating benefit pay under Baxters welfare benefit plan and result in lower compensation recognized for company matching under Baxters tax-qualified Section 401(k) plan. Participants may elect to be paid distributions either in a lump sum payment or in annual installment payments over two to fifteen years. Such election must be made when the participant first becomes eligible to participate in the plan. Distributions will be paid in the first quarter of the plan year following such participants termination of employment unless such participant is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No distributions will be paid in connection with the termination of a specified employee until at least six months following such termination and any amounts that would have otherwise been paid during such six month period shall be accumulated and paid in a lump sum, without interest, at the expiration of such period. Potential Payments Upon Termination Following A Change in Control In consideration for the benefits discussed below, each of Dr. Hantson and Mr. Hombach has agreed with Baxter to be bound for two years from the date of his termination to non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disparagement covenants. A condition for receiving the payments discussed below is the execution of a customary release of claims in a form reasonably acceptable to Baxter. Each of Dr. Hantson and Mr. Hombach has entered into a severance agreement with Baxter that provides for certain payments in the event Baxter undergoes a change in control and such officer is involuntarily terminated by Baxter or voluntarily terminates his employment with Baxter for good reasonthat is, subject to a double trigger. None of Mr. Goff, Ms. Rosa-Björkeson or Dr. Zagame has such an agreement in place at this time, although it is expected that each will enter into some form of severance arrangement on or after the separation. Payments under the agreements with Dr. Hantson and Mr. Hombach include:  a lump sum cash payment generally equal to twice the aggregate amount of such officers salary and target bonus (reported as severance payments in the table below);  a prorated bonus payment;  a lump sum cash payment generally equal to continued retirement and savings plan accruals for two years;  two years of continued health and welfare benefit coverage;  two years of additional age and service credit for retiree health and welfare benefit purposes; and  outplacement expense reimbursement in an amount not exceeding $50,000. Neither of the severance agreements currently in place between Baxter and Dr. Hantson and Baxter and Mr. Hombach contains any tax gross-up provisions. 119 Table of Contents The table set forth below shows Baxters potential payment and benefit obligations to each of Dr. Hantson and Mr. Hombach assuming that a change in control of Baxter has occurred and as a result he either is terminated or terminates his employment for good reason on December 31, 2014. The accelerated vesting of equity awards that is included in the table below would occur as a result of the terms of the equity compensation programs governing these awards, which are broadly applicable to all recipients, rather than the terms of the severance agreements.

(2) Represents the in-the-money value of unvested stock options, the value of unvested restricted stock units and the target amount of performance share units based on Baxters closing stock price on December 31, 2014 ($73.29). Spin-Off Separation Agreement In connection with the planned separation of Baxter and Baxalta, Mr. Hombach has entered into a severance agreement with Baxter, which will be assumed by Baxalta. The executive severance agreements provide for payments to the executive officer if such executive officers employment is terminated by Baxter or Baxalta without cause (as defined in the executive severance agreement) prior to the first anniversary of the completion of the separation. In such event, the payments include a lump sum payment equal to 1.5 times the executive officers salary and target bonus, a lump sum payment covering six months of cost-sharing for health insurance coverage and outplacement expense reimbursement in an amount not exceeding $50,000. Mr. Hombach Severance Payments $ 2,237,625 Health and Welfare Benefit Coverage 30,000 Outplacement Expenses 50,000 Total $ 2,317,625 120 Table of Contents CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS Agreements with Baxter Following the separation and distribution, Baxalta and Baxter will operate separately, each as an independent public company. Prior to the separation and distribution, Baxalta and Baxter will enter into a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements to effect the separation and provide a framework for Baxaltas relationship with Baxter after the distribution. These agreements will govern the relationships between Baxter and Baxalta subsequent to the completion of the distribution and provide for the separation between Baxter and Baxalta of the assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property and employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after the distribution. In addition to the separation and distribution agreement (which contains many of the key provisions related to Baxaltas separation from Baxter and the distribution of Baxaltas shares of common stock to Baxter shareholders), these agreements include:  the transition services agreement;  the long term services agreement;  the tax matters agreement;  the manufacturing and supply agreement;  the employee matters agreement;  the trademark license agreement;  the Galaxy license agreement;  an international commercial operations agreement; and  a shareholders and registration rights agreement with respect to Baxters continuing ownership of Baxalta common stock. See also Description of Material IndebtednessSenior Notes Issuance for a description of the guarantee issued by Baxter in connection with the issuance of Baxaltas senior notes. As described therein, such guarantee will automatically terminate upon the distribution. The material agreements described below have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement on Form S-1 of which this prospectus is a part, and the summaries below set forth the terms of the agreements that Baxalta believes are material. These summaries are qualified in their entireties by reference to the full text of the applicable agreements, which are incorporated by reference into this prospectus. The terms of the agreements described below that will be in effect following the distribution have not yet been finalized. Changes to these agreements, some of which may be material, may be made prior to the distribution. In addition, Baxter and Baxalta will enter into other agreements prior to the distribution that are not material to Baxaltas business. These agreements include lease and sublease agreements, agreements related to sharing of resources and costs related to company planes, as well as certain distribution and other commercial agreements. The Separation and Distribution Agreement The separation and distribution agreement will set forth the agreements between Baxter and Baxalta regarding the principal transactions required to effect Baxaltas separation from Baxter and other agreements governing Baxaltas relationship with Baxter. The separation and distribution agreement will identify assets to be transferred, liabilities to be assumed and contracts to be assigned to each of Baxalta and Baxter as part of the separation, and it will provide for when and how these transfers, assumptions and assignments will occur. In particular, the separation and distribution agreement will provide, among other things, that, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein:  certain assets related to the businesses and operations of Baxters biopharmaceuticals business and any other assets specified in the separation and distribution agreement, which are collectively referred to as the Baxalta Assets, will be transferred to Baxalta or one of Baxaltas subsidiaries; 121 Table of Contents  certain liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise) arising out of or resulting from the Baxalta Assets, other liabilities related to the businesses and operations of Baxters biopharmaceuticals business and any other liabilities specified in the separation and distribution agreement, which are collectively referred to as the Baxalta Liabilities, will be retained by or transferred to Baxalta or one of Baxaltas subsidiaries;  all of the assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise) other than the Baxalta Assets and Baxalta Liabilities (such assets and liabilities are referred to as the Baxter Assets and Baxter Liabilities, respectively) will be retained by or transferred to Baxter or one of its subsidiaries; and  Baxalta and Baxter will use reasonable efforts to cause certain shared contracts to be assigned in part to Baxalta or Baxaltas applicable subsidiaries, appropriately amended, or replaced or otherwise addressed in a manner that allows each of Baxalta and Baxter and their respective subsidiaries to retain the appropriate portion of the benefits and burdens of those contracts in light of the separation of the biopharmaceuticals business from Baxters other businesses. Except as expressly set forth in the separation agreement or any ancillary agreement, neither Baxalta nor Baxter will make any representation or warranty as to the assets, business or liabilities transferred or assumed as part of the separation, as to any approvals or notifications required in connection with the transfers, as to the value of or the freedom from any security interests of any of the assets transferred, as to the absence or presence of any defenses or right of setoff or freedom from counterclaim with respect to any claim or other asset of either Baxalta or Baxter, or as to the legal sufficiency of any assignment, document or instrument delivered to convey title to any asset or thing of value to be transferred in connection with the separation. Except as set forth in the separation agreement or any ancillary agreement, all assets will be transferred on an as is, where is basis and the respective transferees will bear the economic and legal risks that any conveyance will prove to be insufficient to vest in the transferee good and marketable title, free and clear of all security interests, and that any necessary consents or governmental approvals are not obtained or that any requirements of laws, agreements, security interests, or judgments are not complied with. In general, each of Baxter and Baxalta will assume liability for all pending, threatened and unasserted legal matters related to its own business or its assumed or retained liabilities and will indemnify the other party for any liability to the extent arising out of or resulting from such assumed or retained legal matters. In addition, the separation and distribution agreement will provide for cross-indemnities principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of the Baxalta business with Baxalta and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of Baxters remaining business with Baxter. Specifically, each of Baxalta and Baxter will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents against any liabilities resulting from, arising out of or resulting from, directly or indirectly:  the liabilities that each such party assumed or retained pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement (which, in the case of Baxalta, would include the Baxalta Liabilities and, in the case of Baxter, would include the Baxter Liabilities);  in the case of Baxalta, the conduct of any business by it or any of its subsidiaries following the distribution;  in the case of Baxter, the conduct by it and its subsidiaries of their respective businesses, other than as conducted on behalf of Baxalta or any of its subsidiaries;  any breach by such party of the separation and distribution agreement or the other transaction agreements (subject to the limitations, if any, expressly set forth in such agreements);  in the case of Baxalta, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, with respect to all information contained in Baxaltas registration statement on Form 10 initially filed under the Exchange Act on December 10, 2014, together with all amendments and supplements thereto or the information statement forming a part of such registration 122 Table of Contents statement as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time, except to the extent made explicitly in Baxters name or the omission of which makes any statement made explicitly in Baxters name misleading; and  in the case of Baxter, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact made explicitly in Baxters name in Baxaltas registration statement on Form 10 initially filed under the Exchange Act on December 10, 2014, together with all amendments and supplements thereto or the information statement forming a part of such registration statement as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time, or an omission or alleged omission to state a material fact necessary to make any such statement made explicitly in Baxters name not misleading. The separation and distribution agreement also will specify procedures with respect to claims subject to indemnification and related matters. Each of the parties will agree to cooperate with the other party and use commercially reasonable efforts to take or to cause to be taken all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable under applicable law or contractual obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and effectuate the provisions and purposes of, the separation and distribution agreement and the other transaction agreements. The separation agreement provides that, in the event that the transfer or assignment of certain assets and liabilities to Baxalta or Baxter, as applicable, does not occur prior to the distribution (including as a result of governmental or other required third-party consents not being received prior to such time), then until such assets or liabilities are able to be transferred or assigned, Baxalta or Baxter, as applicable, will hold such assets on behalf of and for the benefit of the other party and will pay, perform, and discharge such liabilities, for which the other party will reimburse Baxter or Baxalta, as applicable, for all payments made in connection with the performance and discharge of such liabilities. The separation and distribution agreement also will govern the rights and obligations of Baxter and Baxalta regarding the distribution. The separation and distribution agreement will provide that Baxters obligation to complete the distribution is subject to several conditions that must be satisfied (or waived by Baxter in its sole discretion), which are described in The Separation and DistributionConditions to the Distribution. Under the separation and distribution agreement, following the distribution, Baxalta and Baxter will be obligated to provide each other access to information in certain circumstances. The separation and distribution agreement also will impose obligations with respect to retention of information and confidentiality. The separation and distribution agreement will provide for the allocation among the parties of rights and obligations under existing insurance policies with respect to occurrences prior to completion of the distribution and will set forth procedures for the administration of insured claims. In addition, the separation and distribution agreement will allocate between the parties the right to proceeds and the obligation to incur certain deductibles under certain insurance policies. The separation and distribution agreement may be terminated and the distribution may be amended, modified or abandoned at any time prior to the distribution by Baxter without the approval of Baxalta or any other person. Transition Services Agreement Baxalta and Baxter will enter into a transition services agreement prior to the distribution pursuant to which Baxalta and Baxter and their respective subsidiaries will provide to each other, on an interim, transitional basis, various services. The services to be provided by Baxter will include, among others, finance, information technology, human resources, quality supply chain and certain other administrative services, and will generally be provided on a cost-plus basis. The services generally will commence on the distribution date and will generally terminate within 24 months (or 36 months in the case of certain information technology services) following the distribution date. 123 Table of Contents Baxalta anticipates that it will be in a position to complete the transition away from most of the transition services on or before the date that is 24 months following the distribution date, or 36 months in the case of certain information technology services. The recipient of services will generally have the right to terminate any or all services upon 180 days notice and will have the right to extend the initial duration of some or all of the services for up to six months. Long Term Services Agreement Baxter and Baxalta will enter into a long term services agreement prior to the distribution pursuant to which Baxter and Baxalta and their respective subsidiaries will provide to each other certain services at facilities shared by the parties following the distribution. These services will include providing utilities and other critical services, the absence of which could disrupt the parties operations. The recipient of services will generally have the right to terminate any or all services upon 180 days notice. The services will generally be provided on a cost basis in light of the services generally allowing the parties to each benefit from the continued sharing of fixed costs for services used by each of them. Tax Matters Agreement Baxalta and Baxter will enter into a tax matters agreement prior to the distribution which will generally govern Baxaltas and Baxters respective rights, responsibilities and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes for any tax period ending on or before the distribution date, as well as tax periods beginning before and ending after the distribution date. In addition, the tax matters agreement will address the allocation of liability for taxes that are incurred as a result of restructuring activities undertaken to effectuate the distribution. The tax matters agreement will also provide that Baxalta is liable for taxes incurred by Baxter that may arise if Baxalta takes, or fails to take, as the case may be, certain actions that may result in the distribution failing to meet the requirements of a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Code. Manufacturing and Supply Agreement Baxalta will enter into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Baxter prior to the distribution pursuant to which Baxalta or Baxter, as the case may be, will manufacture, label, and package products for the other party. The terms of the manufacturing and supply agreement will range in initial duration from five to ten years, with the five year arrangements generally having a single one year extension right and the ten year arrangements having four 5-year extension rights. The manufacturing and supply obligations will generally be performed on a cost-plus basis. The terms of the manufacturing and supply agreement will be subject to early termination at the option of the purchaser upon not less than one-years notice, and will also be subject to termination in the event of ongoing breach not cured within 60 days or a bankruptcy-related event of the other party. The manufacturing and supply agreement will provide Baxalta the right during the 10-year initial term for manufacturing of Baxaltas Flexbumin products (plus any extension period thereafter when Baxter continues to have such production capabilities) to purchase equipment that includes Baxter proprietary technology used to manufacture Baxaltas Flexbumin product line. Any such equipment purchased by Baxalta will be at Baxters fully loaded costs thereof, plus the same mark-up applied to other production under the manufacturing and supply agreement. Baxaltas rights to such technology will be limited by the terms of the Galaxy license agreement described in this prospectus, including with respect to the use of such technology and the physical location and ownership of any such equipment. Employee Matters Agreement Baxalta will also enter into an employee matters agreement with Baxter. The employee matters agreement will allocate assets, liabilities and responsibilities relating to employee compensation and benefit plans and programs and other related matters in connection with the separation, including the treatment of outstanding incentive awards and certain retirement and welfare benefit obligations, both in and outside of the United States. 124 Table of Contents The employee matters agreement will provide that, unless otherwise specified, Baxalta will be responsible for liabilities associated with employees who transfer to Baxalta, whether incurred prior to or after the distribution, and Baxter will be responsible for liabilities associated with other employees, including employees retained by Baxter and, except in only a limited number of locations, any former employee. Baxalta employees generally will be eligible to participate in Baxalta benefit plans as of the distribution date. In general, Baxalta benefit plans will contain terms substantially similar to those of the corresponding Baxter plans. In general, Baxalta will credit each employee with his or her service with Baxter prior to the distribution for all purposes under the Baxalta benefit plans, so long as such crediting does not result in a duplication of benefits. Baxalta will establish a deferred compensation plan (the Baxalta DCP), with terms comparable in the aggregate to those of the Baxter International Inc. and Subsidiaries Deferred Compensation Plan as of the distribution date, except that the investment options may be different under the Baxalta DCP. Baxalta will assume, and will cause the Baxalta DCP to assume, all liabilities for obligations under the under the Baxter International Inc. and Subsidiaries Deferred Compensation Plan for the benefits of each transferred employee. Baxter and Baxalta will cause the accounts of each transferred employee participating in the Baxter International Inc. and Subsidiaries Deferred Compensation Plan to be transferred to the Baxalta DCP. Baxalta will credit each transferred employees account with the amount deferred by such person into the Baxter International Inc. and Subsidiaries Deferred Compensation Plan as of the employment transfer date (plus employer contributions) and will recognize and honor all deferral and distribution elections made by such individual. Baxalta will establish pension and retirement plans (whether defined contribution or defined benefit pension plans) with terms reasonably comparable to the corresponding plans at Baxter; provided that in a limited number of countries the parties will continue to share plans for a transitional period. The assets and liabilities under the corresponding Baxter plans with respect to transferred employees will be transferred to the corresponding Baxalta plan. Transferred employees will be eligible to participate in such Baxalta plans to the extent they were eligible to participate in the corresponding Baxter plans as of the applicable pension separation date or employment transfer date, and they will receive credit for Baxter service to the extent credited under the corresponding Baxter Plan and recognition for compensation paid by Baxter that was recognized under the corresponding Baxter plan as though it were compensation paid by Baxalta. Welfare Plans Baxalta will establish health and welfare plans with terms comparable in the aggregate to the corresponding Baxter health and welfare plans. Baxalta will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such plans to waive for purposes of initial enrollment all limitations as to preexisting conditions, service conditions or waiting periods that were not in effect under the corresponding Baxter health and welfare plans as of the employment transfer date, and to take into account eligible expenses incurred by a transferred employee in the portion of the year prior to the transfer date for purposes of satisfying deductible and other out-of-pocket requirements, as well as prior claim experience with the corresponding Baxter health and welfare plans with respect to maximum benefits available. Baxter will retain liability for claims incurred under the Baxter health and welfare plans, except that Baxalta will be responsible for claims incurred by employees who have transferred to Baxalta. Baxalta shall generally be responsible for disability benefits with respect to transferred employees, subject to exceptions specified in the employee matters agreement. Following the distribution date, Baxalta employees will generally participate in Baxaltas health and welfare plans. Baxter will retain liability for retiree medical and life insurance benefits for employees continuing with Baxter and for former employees. 125 Table of Contents Equity Compensation Awards The employee matters agreement will provide that the outstanding Baxter equity awards held by Baxter and Baxalta employees will be treated as described in the section entitled Executive CompensationEffects of the Separation on Outstanding Executive Compensation Awards; Baxalta Compensation. If local regulations outside the United States or the terms of any employment agreement do not permit use of any adjustment method described therein or would cause an adverse effect for equity award holders, a compliant alternative adjustment method will be used. Trademark License Agreement Baxalta and Baxter will enter into a transitional trademark license agreement pursuant to which each will grant the other a non-exclusive, royalty-free and worldwide license to use certain of each others trademarks following the distribution, with the license granted to Baxter limited to use by Baxter in its performance of its obligations under the separation transaction agreements. The license to Baxalta will allow it to continue using certain of Baxters trademarks (including the Baxter name) in order to provide sufficient time for Baxalta to rebrand or phase out its use of the licensed marks. Baxalta will use commercially reasonable efforts to take all such actions necessary to allow it to conduct its business without using Baxters trademarks and will generally discontinue such use as soon as reasonably practicable. In addition to the general requirement that Baxalta discontinue use as soon as reasonably practicable, Baxalta will be required to cease all use of the licensed marks within a specified period of time after the distribution date. If Baxalta is unable to discontinue use of the licensed marks within these time frames, it may request Baxters consent for an extension with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Baxter may immediately terminate its license to Baxalta if Baxalta breaches any of its obligations under the agreement and fails to cure such breach within a reasonable period of time. Galaxy License Agreement Baxalta will enter into an intellectual property license agreement with Baxter pursuant to which Baxalta will receive a perpetual, non-transferrable, non-sublicenseable, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide license to certain intellectual property known as the Galaxy technology in order to allow Baxalta to continue using such technology in its plasma-derived products. This license will primarily provide Baxalta with the right to Galaxy trademarks, as well as know-how and trade secrets necessary to operate and maintain (but not to manufacture) equipment using the Galaxy technology. The license will be exclusive to Baxalta with respect to the production and packaging of products that are primarily and directly derived from the fractionation of plasma, and Baxaltas rights shall only apply to the production and packaging of any of Baxaltas products that are primarily and directly derived from the fractionation of plasma. The license rights granted to Baxalta will only apply with respect to specified equipment purchased or otherwise transferred from Baxter, and only with respect to the use of such equipment at a list of Baxalta-owned locations agreed upon in advance by Baxter and Baxalta. The license will be subject to termination in the event of ongoing breach not cured within 45 days, a bankruptcy-related event of the other party or in connection with any assignment in violation of the agreement. Following any termination or at any time when Baxter has the right to terminate the license agreement, Baxter will have the right to purchase any of the specified equipment to which the license rights apply or applied at a price equal to the then-current net book value of such equipment. International Commercial Operations Agreement The local separation of Baxaltas business in certain countries outside the United States will not occur until after the distribution date due to regulatory requirements, the need to obtain consents from local governmental authorities, and other business reasons. The international commercial operations agreement will provide for the 126 Table of Contents conduct of the Baxalta business by Baxter in such countries until the local separation is completed, and will provide that Baxalta will be subject to all the risks and burdens and entitled to all the rewards generated by the Baxalta business during such period. The international commercial operations agreement will also govern the process for the local separation of Baxaltas business following the distribution date. Shareholders and Registration Rights Agreement Prior to the distribution, Baxter and Baxalta will enter into a Shareholders and Registration Rights Agreement pursuant to which Baxalta will agree that, upon the request of Baxter or certain subsequent transferees as further defined therein, Baxalta will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration under applicable federal and state securities laws of any shares of Baxaltas common stock retained by Baxter. In addition, Baxter will agree to vote any shares of Baxaltas common stock that it retains immediately after the distribution in proportion to the votes cast by Baxaltas other shareholders. In connection with such agreement, Baxter will grant Baxalta a proxy to vote its shares of Baxaltas retained common stock in such proportion. Any such proxy, however, will be automatically revoked as to a particular share upon any sale or transfer of such share from Baxter to a person other than Baxter, and neither the Shareholders and Registration Rights Agreement nor proxy will limit or prohibit any such sale or transfer. Procedures for Approval of Related Person Transactions Baxalta expects to initially operate pursuant to Corporate Governance Guidelines that are substantially similar to those in effect at Baxter. Accordingly, the Baxalta Board of Directors or a committee thereof will be charged with reviewing related person transactions regardless of whether the transactions are reportable pursuant to applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. For purposes of this policy, a related person transaction is expected to include any transaction in which the company was or is to be a participant and in which any related person has a direct or indirect material interest other than transactions that involve less than $50,000 when aggregated with all similar transactions. For any related person transaction to be consummated or to continue, it is expected that the Board of Directors or the applicable committee thereof must approve or ratify the transaction. The Board of Directors or committee thereof is expected to only approve or ratify a transaction if the Board of Directors or such committee first determines that such transaction is in Baxaltas best interest. Related person transactions will be reviewed as they arise and are reported to the Board of Directors or applicable committee. The Board of Directors or applicable committee is also expected to review materials prepared by the Corporate Secretary to determine whether any related person transactions have occurred that have not been reported. It is expected that Baxalta will adopt a policy similar to Baxters policy requiring it to disclose all related person transactions in the companys applicable filings to the extent required by the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 127 Table of Contents SECURITY OWNERSHIP BY CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT Before the distribution, all of the outstanding shares of Baxaltas common stock will be owned beneficially and of record by Baxter. After the distribution, Baxter will own approximately 19.5% of Baxaltas common stock. The following table provides information with respect to the expected beneficial ownership of Baxaltas common stock, immediately following the completion of the distribution by (1) each person who Baxalta believes will be a beneficial owner of more than 5% of the companys outstanding common stock, (2) each of Baxaltas directors and named executive officers, and (3) all directors and executive officers as a group. Baxalta based the share amounts on each persons beneficial ownership of Baxters common stock and stock options or other equity awards as of May 5, 2015, unless Baxalta indicates some other basis for the share amounts, and assumes a distribution ratio of one share of Baxaltas common stock for every share of Baxters common stock. The address of each director and executive officer shown in the table below is c/o Baxalta, One Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, Illinois 60015.

(2) Amount of shares includes options that are exercisable as of May 5, 2015 and options which become exercisable within 60 days thereafter. (3) Number of shares of common stock determined for this purpose based on the assumption that Baxter would receive a number of shares of Baxalta common stock that would result in Baxter owning 19.5% of the total outstanding shares following the distribution. For a description of certain voting arrangements relating to the shares of Baxaltas common stock retained by Baxter, see Certain Relationships and Related Person TransactionsAgreements with BaxterShareholders and Registration Rights Agreement. (4) Based on a Schedule 13G filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2015 related to ownership of Baxter common stock, pursuant to which BlackRock, Inc. reported that it is deemed to be the beneficial owner of Baxter common stock with the sole power to vote or direct the voting of 29,278,838 shares and the sole power to dispose or direct the disposition of 34,216,022 shares. (5) Includes 696 shares not held directly by Mr. Stroucken but in a family trust of which he is a beneficial owner. (6) Includes 24,814 options which are owned by Mr. Hombach in a constructive trust and as to which he disclaims beneficial ownership. (7) Includes 811 shares beneficially owned as of May 5, 2015 by executive officers in Baxters tax-qualified section 401(K) plan, over which such executive officers have voting and investment power. 128 Table of Contents PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION In connection with the separation, outstanding awards granted under Baxters equity compensation programs (whether held by Baxter or Baxalta employees or other participants) will be converted into adjusted awards based on shares of Baxter common stock, shares of Baxalta common stock or both, as described under Executive Compensation-Effects of the Separation on Outstanding Executive Compensation Awards; Baxalta Compensation. Those adjusted awards that are based on Baxalta common stock, which are referred to as Converted Awards, will be granted by Baxalta under the Baxalta Incorporated 2015 Incentive Plan, in accordance with the terms of the employee matters agreement that Baxalta will enter into with Baxter in connection with the separation. The registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part covers shares of Baxalta common stock issued pursuant to Converted Awards that will be granted to individuals who, at the time of the distribution, are no longer employed by or serving on the board of directors of Baxter. The registration statement does not cover any shares of Baxalta common stock issued pursuant to Converted Awards that will be granted to any individual who, upon completion of the distribution, will be employed by or serve on the board of directors of either Baxter or Baxalta, or any other awards that Baxalta may grant under the Baxalta Incorporated 2015 Incentive Plan in the future. 129 Table of Contents BAXALTA INCORPORATED 2015 INCENTIVE PLAN Eligibility All officers, directors or other employees of Baxalta or its subsidiaries, consultants, independent contractors or agents of Baxalta or its subsidiaries, and persons who are expected to become officers, employees, directors, consultants, independent contractors or agents of Baxalta or a subsidiary, including, in each case, directors who are not employees of Baxalta or a subsidiary, are eligible to receive awards under the 2015 Plan. Baxalta expects to employ approximately 16,000 persons as of the distribution date. New Plan Benefits The specific individuals who will be granted awards under the 2015 Plan (Participants) and the type and amount of any such awards will be determined by the Committee (as defined below), subject to annual limits on the maximum amounts that may be awarded to any individual, as described below. Accordingly, future awards to be received by or allocated to particular individuals under the 2015 Plan are not presently determinable. Administration A committee selected by Baxaltas Board of Directors (the Committee) will administer the 2015 Plan. The Committee must be comprised of at least two members of the Board of Directors (unless a larger number is required by applicable Securities and Exchange Commission or stock exchange listing rules). Performance-based awards under the 2015 Plan must be made by a committee that consists solely of outside directors determined under Section 162(m) of the Code. Grants of awards to directors who are not employees of Baxalta or a subsidiary must be made by the full Board of Directors and the full Board of Directors will be the Committee with respect to such awards. Otherwise, unless specified by the Board of Directors, the Committee will be the Compensation Committee. Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange, the Committee may delegate its responsibilities under the 2015 Plan to one or more of its members or to other persons selected by it. Subject to the terms and conditions of the 2015 Plan and the individual award agreements, the Committee will have the authority and discretion to: (i) select eligible individuals who will receive awards under the 2015 Plan; (ii) determine the time or times of receipt of awards; (iii) determine the types of awards and the number of shares covered by the awards; (iv) establish the terms, conditions, performance targets, restrictions, and other provisions of such awards; (v) modify the terms of, cancel, or suspend awards; (vi) reissue or repurchase awards; and (vii) accelerate the exercisability or vesting of any award. In making such award determinations, the Committee may take into account the nature of services rendered by the respective individual, the individuals present and potential contributions to Baxaltas or a subsidiarys success and such other factors as the Committee deems relevant. The Committee will have the authority and discretion to determine the extent to which awards under the 2015 Plan will be structured to conform to the requirements applicable to performance-based compensation (as discussed below), and to take such action, establish such procedures and impose such restrictions at the time such awards are granted as the Committee determines to be necessary or appropriate to conform to those requirements. The Committee also has the authority and discretion to conclusively interpret the 2015 Plan, to establish, amend and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the 2015 Plan, to determine the terms and provisions of any agreements made pursuant to the 2015 Plan, to remedy any defect or omission and reconcile any inconsistency in the 2015 Plan or any award, and to make all other determinations that may be necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2015 Plan. Shares Subject to the 2015 Plan and Limits on Awards The maximum number of shares that may be delivered to Participants and their beneficiaries under the 2015 Plan may not exceed 91,000,000 shares of Baxaltas common stock, subject to adjustment as described below. Any shares subject to full value awards made under the 2015 Plan (see Type of AwardsFull Value Awards 130 Table of Contents below) shall be counted against the 91,000,000 limit as three (3) shares for every one (1) share issued in connection with such award. Any shares subject to an award that expires or is forfeited, cancelled, surrendered, or terminated without issuance of shares (including shares attributable to awards settled in cash) will again be available for awards under the 2015 Plan; provided that if shares subject to any full value award made under the 2015 Plan are forfeited, cancelled, surrendered or terminated without issuance of shares, three (3) times the number of shares so forfeited cancelled, surrendered or terminated will again be available for issuance under the 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan will not permit adding shares back to the number available for issuance when a SAR is net settled, when shares are retained or delivered to Baxalta to pay the exercise price and/or tax withholding requirements associated with an award, or when Baxalta repurchases shares on the open market using the proceeds from payment of the exercise price in connection with the exercise of an outstanding stock option. Substitute awards (that is, awards issued in assumption of, or in substitution or exchange for, an award previously granted or the right or obligation to make a future award, by a company acquired by Baxalta or a subsidiary or with which Baxalta or a subsidiary combines) do not reduce the number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2015 Plan or that may be covered by awards granted during any calendar year to a Participant as described below. Shares used for awards under the 2015 Plan may be shares currently authorized but unissued or currently held or subsequently acquired by Baxalta as treasury shares, including shares purchased in the open market or in private transactions. To the extent provided by the Committee, an award under the 2015 Plan may be settled in cash rather than common stock. The following additional limits apply to awards under the 2015 Plan: (i) no more than 91,000,000 aggregate shares of common stock may be delivered to Participants and their beneficiaries with respect to incentive stock options; (ii) the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be covered by options and SARs granted to any one Participant in any one calendar year is 2,000,000 (not including spin-off awards as defined below); (iii) the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be delivered pursuant to full value awards intended to be performance-based compensation (as described below) that are granted to any one Participant during any one calendar-year period, regardless of whether settlement of the award is to occur prior to, at the time of, or after the time of vesting, is 500,000 (not including spin-off awards); and (iv) the maximum amount of cash incentive awards intended to be performance-based compensation payable to any one Participant for any twelve month performance period will be $10,000,000 (on an aggregate basis if there is more than one performance period in a year). If awards are denominated in cash but an equivalent amount of shares is delivered in lieu of cash, the applicable limits for performance-based compensation will be applied to the cash based on the methodology used by the Committee to convert the cash into shares. Any adjustment in the amount delivered due to deferred delivery of shares or cash is disregarded for purposes of applying the foregoing limits for performance-based compensation. Adjustments In the event a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, distribution, split-up, spin-off, exchange of shares, or similar corporate transaction affects the shares such that the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that an adjustment is warranted in order to preserve the benefits or prevent the enlargement of benefits of awards under the 2015 Plan, then the Committee shall, in the manner it deems equitable: (i) adjust the number and kind of shares that may be delivered under the 2015 Plan (including adjustments to the individual limits); (ii) adjust the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding awards; (iii) adjust the exercise price of outstanding options and SARs; and (iv) make other adjustments, including without limitation, (A) replacement of awards with other awards that the Committee determines have comparable value and are based on stock of a company resulting from or involved in the transaction, and (B) cancellation of the award in return for cash payment of the current value of the award, determined as though the award is fully vested at the time of payment. 131 Table of Contents Types of Awards The types of awards that may be granted by the Committee to Participants under the 2015 Plan are described below. Stock Options The Committee may grant incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options under the 2015 Plan. A stock option gives the Participant the right to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price determined under the option. Incentive stock options are options that are intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code and may only be granted to employees of Baxalta and its subsidiaries (as defined in Section 424 of the Code). The exercise price for an option cannot be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date the option is granted. The Committee may grant options in tandem with SARs, in which case the exercise price of the option and SAR will be the same, and the exercise of the option or SAR with respect to a share will cancel the corresponding tandem SAR or option, as applicable, with respect to such share. Options granted under the 2015 Plan will be exercisable in accordance with the terms established by the Committee; provided, however, that options may only be exercised with respect to whole shares. The exercise price of an option will be payable in cash or cash equivalents, in shares of common stock valued at fair market value as of the day of exercise, or in a combination thereof, and to the extent permitted by the Committee may also be paid through a broker-assisted cashless exercise, by withholding a number of shares with a fair market value equal to the exercise price, or by any other method permitted by applicable law. The exercise price must be paid in full at the time of exercise (except if the exercise price is paid using cash equivalents, payment may be made as soon as practicable after the exercise). The Committee, in its discretion, may impose such conditions, restrictions and contingencies on shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an option as the Committee determines to be desirable. Except for adjustments to shares in connection with corporate transactions or as approved by Baxaltas shareholders, the exercise price of an option cannot be decreased after the date of grant and no option may be surrendered in consideration for the grant of a replacement option at a lower exercise price. In no event will an option expire more than ten years after the date of grant (or such shorter period required by law or the rules of any stock exchange). Stock Appreciation Rights The Committee may grant SARs under the 2015 Plan. An SAR entitles the Participant to receive the amount (in cash or stock) by which the fair market value of a specified number of shares on the exercise date exceeds an exercise price established by the Committee. The exercise price of an SAR cannot be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date the SAR is granted. The Committee may grant SARs in tandem with options, in which case the exercise price of the SAR and option will be the same, and the exercise of the SAR or option with respect to a share will cancel the corresponding tandem option or SAR, as applicable, with respect to such share. SARs granted under the 2015 Plan will be exercisable in accordance with the terms established by the Committee; provided, however, that SARs may only be exercised with respect to whole shares. The Committee, in its discretion, may impose such conditions, restrictions and contingencies on shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an SAR as the Committee determines to be desirable. Except for adjustments to shares in connection with corporate transactions or as approved by Baxaltas shareholders, the exercise price of an SAR cannot be decreased after the date of grant and no SAR may be surrendered in consideration for the grant of a replacement SAR at a lower exercise price. 132 Table of Contents In no event will an SAR expire more than ten years after the date of grant (or such shorter period required by law or the rules of any stock exchange). Full Value Awards The Committee may grant full value awards under the 2015 Plan. A full value award is the grant of one or more shares of common stock or a right to receive one or more shares of common stock in the future (including restricted shares, restricted share units, performance shares, dividend equivalent units and performance share units), with such grant subject to one or more of the following, as determined by the Committee:  The grant may be in consideration of a Participants previously performed services, or surrender of other compensation that may be due.  The grant may be contingent on the achievement of performance or other objectives during a specified period.  The grant may be subject to a risk of forfeiture or other restrictions that will lapse upon the achievement of one or more goals relating to completion of service by the Participant or achievement of performance or other objectives. The grant may also be subject to such other conditions, restrictions and contingencies, as determined by the Committee, including provisions relating to dividend or dividend equivalent rights and deferred payment or settlement. Cash Incentive Awards The Committee may grant cash incentive awards under the 2015 Plan which are the grant of rights to receive a payment of cash (or in the discretion of the Committee, shares of common stock having value equivalent to the cash otherwise payable) that are contingent on achievement of performance objectives over a specified period established by the Committee. The grant of cash incentive awards may also be subject to such other conditions, restrictions and contingencies, as determined by the Committee, including provisions relating to deferred payment. Performance Measures An income tax deduction for Baxalta will generally be unavailable for annual compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the chief executive officer or any of the three most highly compensated officers (other than the chief financial officer under current guidance). However, amounts that constitute performance-based compensation are not counted toward the $1 million limit. It is expected that options and SARs granted under the 2015 Plan will satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation. The Committee may designate whether any full value awards or cash incentive awards being granted to any Participant are intended to be performance-based compensation as that term is used in Section 162(m) of the Code. Any such awards designated as intended to be performance-based compensation will be conditioned on the achievement of one or more performance measures, to the extent required by Code Section 162(m). The performance measures that may be used by the Committee for such awards will be based on any one or more of the following, as selected by the Committee: (i) sales or net sales; (ii) gross profit or margin; (iii) expenses, including cost of goods sold, operating expenses, marketing and administrative expense, research and development, restructuring or other special or unusual items, interest, tax expense, or other measures of savings; (iv) operating earnings, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, or amortization, net earnings, earnings per share (basic or diluted) or other measure of earnings; (v) cash flow, including cash flow from operations, investing, or financing activities, before or after dividends, investments, or capital expenditures; (vi) balance sheet performance, including debt, long or short term, inventory, accounts payable or receivable, working capital, or shareholders equity; (vii) return measures, including return on invested capital, sales, assets, 133 Table of Contents or equity; (viii) stock price performance or shareholder return; (ix) economic value created or added; or (x) implementation or completion of critical projects, including acquisitions, divestitures, and other ventures, process improvements, product or production quality, attainment of other strategic objectives, including market penetration, geographic expansion, product development, regulatory or quality performance, innovation or research goals, or the like. In each case, performance may be measured (A) on an aggregate or net basis; (B) before or after tax or cumulative effect of accounting changes; (C) relative to other approved measures, on an aggregate or percentage basis, over time, or as compared to performance by other companies or groups of other companies; or (D) by product, product line, business unit or segment, or geographic unit. The performance targets may include a threshold level of performance below which no payment will be made (or no vesting will occur), levels of performance at which specified payments will be made (or specified vesting will occur), and a maximum level of performance above which no additional payment will be made (or at which full vesting will occur). Each of the foregoing performance targets will be determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or in accordance with accounting principles established by the International Accounting Standards Board, where applicable, and in any case will be subject to certification by the Committee; provided that the Committee will have the authority to exclude the impact of charges for restructurings, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and other unusual, special, or non-recurring events, asset write downs, litigation or claim judgments or settlements, reorganization or change in the capital structure of Baxalta, foreign exchange gains or losses and the cumulative effects of tax or accounting principles as identified in financial results filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. For awards intended to be performance-based compensation, the grant of the awards and the establishment of the performance measures will be made during the period required under Code Section 162(m). Dividends and Dividend Equivalents Awards may provide for the payment or crediting of dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to the underlying shares, which will either be paid at the same time that dividends are paid on Baxaltas shares, or deferred and paid only at the time and to the extent that the award vests, as determined by the Committee. No Repricing Except as approved by Baxaltas shareholders or as adjusted for corporate transactions described above, the exercise price of an option or SAR may not be decreased after the date of grant nor may an option or SAR be surrendered to Baxalta as consideration for the grant of a replacement option or SAR with a lower exercise price, or repurchased or surrendered for cash consideration if the exercise price of the option or SAR exceeds the fair market value of the stock. Spin-Off Awards As part of the spin-off, certain employees of both Baxter and Baxalta who held awards of options, SARs or full-value awards granted under one of Baxters equity incentive plans will automatically receive, without further action by the Committee, grants of options, SARs or full-value awards with respect to the number of Baxter awards held by them (spin-off awards), as described more fully in the section entitled Executive CompensationEffects of the Separation on Outstanding Executive Compensation Awards; Baxalta Compensation. To the extent that the Baxter award upon which a spin-off award was based requires additional employment in order for the award to vest, the spin-off award will be subject to the same vesting schedule and, if the spin-off award is held by a Participant who is an employee of Baxter, vesting will be conditioned upon the Participants continued employment by Baxter. 134 Table of Contents Special Director Provisions Notwithstanding any other provision of the 2015 Plan to the contrary, unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, awards to non-employee directors shall be made in accordance with the terms of Baxaltas non-employee director compensation plan as in effect from time to time, and all such awards shall be deemed to be made under the 2015 Plan. Baxaltas 2015 non-employee director compensation plan provides for formulaic equity grants to directors. Directors receive annual grants of stock options with a value of $65,000 and restricted stock units with a value of $128,000 on the date of the annual shareholders meeting. The same grants will be received on the date of the spin-off by any non-employee director who was not a non-employee director of Baxter at the time of Baxters 2015 annual shareholders meeting and did not receive an annual grant under Baxters non-employee director compensation plan. If a person becomes a non-employee director other than on the date of an annual meeting, the person will receive a grant of options and restricted stock units with the value set forth above, but pro rated for the number of full months he or she will be a member of the Board of Directors until the next annual meeting. Both options and restricted stock units granted pursuant to the 2015 non-employee director compensation plan generally vest on the date of the first annual shareholders meeting following the date of grant, subject to accelerated vesting if a director dies or leaves the Board of Directors due to disability prior to the next annual shareholders meeting or, in the case of options, leaves the Board of Directors after serving for ten years (counting service on the Baxter Board of Directors) or attaining the age of 72. Change in Control In the event of a Change in Control, as defined in the 2015 Plan, no award that is not otherwise vested shall become vested solely as a result of the Change in Control, except as otherwise determined by the Committee in the case of a Change in Control that results in Baxalta no longer being publicly traded, or being acquired by an acquirer that does not assume the outstanding awards or provide for substitute awards. However, if a Participants employment is terminated by Baxalta without Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason, as both such terms are defined in the Plan, within twenty-four months following a Change in Control, then, unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, all outstanding awards held by the Participant will fully vest on the date of the termination, and in the case of an option or SAR will remain outstanding until the end of the original term of the option or SAR. If vesting is dependent upon the achievement of performance goals, the goals will be deemed to have been met at the target level. A spin-off award held by a Participant who is an employee of Baxter will vest if the Participants employment by Baxter is terminated without Cause or for Good Reason within twenty-four months following a Change in Control of Baxter. Clawbacks All awards granted under the 2015 Plan will be deemed to incorporate any clawback provisions adopted by Baxalta in accordance with applicable law, including those required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Committee may also include clawback provisions in any award agreement in cases including but not limited to violation by a Participant of Baxalta policies or restrictive covenant agreements. Foreign Employees Notwithstanding any other provision of the 2015 Plan to the contrary, the Committee may grant awards to eligible persons who are foreign nationals on such terms and conditions different from those specified in the Plan as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable to foster and promote achievement of the purposes of the 2015 Plan. In furtherance of such purposes, the Committee may make such modifications, amendments, procedures and subplans as may be necessary or advisable to comply with provisions of laws in other countries or jurisdictions in which Baxalta or a subsidiary operates or has employees. 135 Table of Contents Withholding All awards and other payments under the 2015 Plan are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes, which withholding obligations may be satisfied, with the consent of the Committee, through the surrender of shares which the Participant already owns or to which a Participant is otherwise entitled under the 2015 Plan provided that previously-owned shares that have been held by the Participant or shares to which the Participant is entitled under the 2015 Plan may only be used to satisfy the minimum tax withholding required by applicable law (or other rates that will not have a negative accounting impact). Amendment and Termination The 2015 Plan is unlimited in duration and, in the event of termination (as described below) will remain in effect as long as any shares awarded under the 2015 Plan remain outstanding and not fully vested. No new awards can be made under the 2015 Plan on or after the tenth anniversary of the date on which the 2015 Plan was adopted by the Board. No awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation may be granted after the first shareholder meeting to occur in 2017 unless the shareholders approve the plan at or prior to such meeting. The 2015 Plan may be amended or terminated at any time by the Board of Directors and any award under the 2015 Plan may be amended by the Board or the Committee, provided that no amendment or termination may, in the absence of written consent to the change by the affected Participant (or, if the Participant is not then living and if applicable, the affected beneficiary), adversely affect the rights of any Participant or, if applicable, beneficiary under any award granted under the 2015 Plan prior to the date such amendment is adopted by the Board of Directors (or the Committee, if applicable). Adjustments relating to corporate transactions are not subject to the foregoing limitations. No amendment will be made to the provisions of the 2015 Plan relating to prohibitions on repricing without the approval of Baxaltas shareholders and no other amendment will be made to the 2015 Plan without the approval of Baxaltas shareholders if shareholder approval of such amendment is required by law or the rules of any stock exchange on which shares of common stock are listed. It is the intention of Baxalta that, to the extent that any provisions of the 2015 Plan or any awards granted under the 2015 Plan are subject to Section 409A of the Code (relating to nonqualified deferred compensation), the 2015 Plan and the awards comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and it is the intention of Baxalta that the 2015 Plan and awards will be administered in good faith in accordance with such requirements and that the Committee will have the authority to amend any outstanding awards to conform to the requirements of Section 409A. None of Baxalta or any of its subsidiaries, however, guarantees that awards under the 2015 Plan will comply with Section 409A and the Committee is under no obligation to make any changes to any awards to cause such compliance. Transferability Awards under the 2015 Plan generally are not transferable except as designated by the Participant by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or, to the extent provided by the Committee, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order (within the meaning of the Code and applicable rules thereunder). To the extent that the Participant who receives an award under the 2015 Plan has the right to exercise such award, the award may be exercised during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant. The Committee may permit awards under the 2015 Plan to be transferred to or for the benefit of the Participants family (including, without limitation, to a trust or partnership for the benefit of a Participants family), subject to such procedures as the Committee may establish. Incentive stock options may not be transferred to the extent that such transferability would violate the requirements applicable to such option under Section 422 of the Code. United States Federal Income Tax Consequences The following is a brief description of the U.S. Federal income tax treatment that will generally apply to awards under the 2015 Plan to U.S. taxpayers based on current U.S. Federal income tax laws and regulations 136 Table of Contents presently in effect, which are subject to change, and it does not purport to be a complete description of the Federal income tax aspects of the 2015 Plan. A Participant may also be subject to state and local taxes in connection with the grant of awards under the 2015 Plan. Baxalta recommends that Participants consult with their individual tax advisors to determine the applicability of the tax rules to the awards granted to them in their personal circumstances. Under present U.S. Federal income tax laws, awards granted under the 2015 Plan generally will have the following tax consequences: Non-Qualified Options The grant of a non-qualified option (NQO) will not result in taxable income to the Participant. Except as described below, the Participant will realize ordinary income at the time of exercise in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares acquired over the exercise price for those shares, and Baxalta will be entitled to a corresponding deduction, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code and other limitations on the deductibility of compensation generally. Gains or losses realized by the Participant upon disposition of such shares will be treated as capital gains and losses, with the basis in such shares equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise. The exercise of an NQO through the delivery of previously acquired stock will generally be treated as a non-taxable, like-kind exchange as to the number of shares surrendered and the identical number of shares received under the option. That number of shares will take the same basis and, for capital gains purposes, the same holding period as the shares that are given up. The value of the shares received upon such an exchange that are in excess of the number given up will be includible as ordinary income to the Participant at the time of the exercise. The excess shares will have a new holding period for capital gain purposes and a basis equal to the value of such shares determined at the time of exercise. Incentive Stock Options The grant of an incentive stock option (ISO) will not result in taxable income to the Participant. The exercise of an ISO will not result in taxable income to the Participant provided that the Participant was, without a break in service, an employee of Baxalta or a subsidiary (as defined in Section 424 of the Code) during the period beginning on the date of the grant of the option and ending on the date three months prior to the date of exercise (one year prior to the date of exercise if the Participant is disabled, as that term is defined in the Code). The excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of the exercise of an ISO over the exercise price is an adjustment that is included in the calculation of the Participants alternative minimum taxable income for the tax year in which the ISO is exercised. For purposes of determining the Participants alternative minimum tax liability for the year of disposition of the shares acquired pursuant to the ISO exercise, the Participant will have a basis in those shares equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise. If the Participant does not sell or otherwise dispose of the stock within two years from the date of the grant of the ISO or within one year after receiving the transfer of such stock, then, upon disposition of such shares, any amount realized in excess of the exercise price will be taxed to the Participant as capital gain, and Baxalta will not be entitled to any deduction for Federal income tax purposes. A capital loss will be recognized to the extent that the amount realized is less than the exercise price. If the foregoing holding period requirements are not met, the Participant will generally realize ordinary income, and a corresponding deduction will be allowed to Baxalta, at the time of the disposition of the shares, in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price, or (ii) the excess, if any, of the amount realized upon disposition of the shares over the exercise price. If the amount realized exceeds the value of the shares on the date of exercise, any additional 137 Table of Contents amount will be capital gain. If the amount realized is less than the exercise price, the Participant will recognize no income and a capital loss will be recognized equal to the excess of the exercise price over the amount realized upon the disposition of the shares. If a Participant dies either while employed, or within three months after terminating employment (one year in the case of disability), the foregoing provisions will apply to the exercise of an ISO by the Participants estate, even if the exercise occurs more than three months (or one year) after the date of termination and the estate disposes of the stock less than two years from the date (of grant or less than one year from the date of exercise). Stock Appreciation Rights The grant of an SAR will not result in taxable income to the Participant. Upon exercise of an SAR, the amount of cash or the fair market value of shares received will be taxable to the Participant as ordinary income, and a corresponding deduction will be allowed to Baxalta, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code and other limitations on the deductibility of compensation generally. Gains or losses realized by the Participant upon disposition of such shares will be treated as capital gains and losses, with the basis in such shares equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise. Full Value Awards Generally, a Participant who has been granted a full value award will not realize taxable income at the time of grant, and Baxalta will not be entitled to a deduction at that time. The Participant will have taxable income at the time of distribution equal to the amount of cash received and the then fair market value of the distributed shares, and Baxalta will be entitled to a corresponding deduction, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code and other limitations on the deductibility of compensation generally. If the full award consists of shares that are subject to restrictions, then assuming that the restrictions on the award constitute a substantial risk of forfeiture for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Participant will not realize taxable income at the time of grant and Baxalta will not be entitled to a deduction at that time. Upon the vesting of shares subject to the award, the holder will realize ordinary income in an amount equal to the then fair market value of those shares and Baxalta will be entitled to a corresponding deduction, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code and other limitations on the deductibility of compensation generally. Gains or losses realized by the Participant upon disposition of such shares will be treated as capital gains and losses, with the basis in such shares equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of vesting. Dividends, if any, paid to the holder during the restriction period will also be compensation income to the Participant and deductible as compensation expense by Baxalta. If the restrictions on the award do not constitute a substantial risk of forfeiture or if the Participant elects, pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code, to recognize income at the date of grant of the award, the Participant will recognize income at the date of grant equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant, the applicable capital gain holding period will commence as of that date, and Baxalta will be entitled to a deduction for compensation expense at the time of grant, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code and other limitations on the deductibility of compensation generally, and dividends paid during the restriction period will be treated as dividends rather than additional compensation for tax purposes. Cash Incentive Awards A Participant will realize taxable income at the time the cash incentive award is distributed, and Baxalta will be entitled to a corresponding deduction, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code and other limitations on the deductibility of compensation generally. Change in Control Any acceleration of the vesting or payment of awards under the 2015 Plan in the event of a Change in Control (as defined under Section 280G of the Code) in Baxalta may cause part or all of the consideration involved to be treated as an excess parachute payment under the Code, which may subject the Participant to a 20% excise tax and which may not be deductible by Baxalta. 138 Table of Contents THE SEPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION Background On March 27, 2014, Baxter announced that it intended to separate its biopharmaceuticals business from its medical products business. The medical products business offers a broad portfolio of intravenous (IV) solutions and nutritional therapies, infusion pumps and administration sets, premixed and other injectable drugs, inhalation anesthetics, hospital-based biosurgery products, as well as a comprehensive portfolio of products and services to treat end-stage renal disease across the full continuum of care. The biopharmaceuticals business offers a differentiated portfolio of innovative therapies that seek to address unmet medical needs across many disease areas, including hematology, immunology and oncology. Baxter announced that it intended to effect the separation through a pro rata distribution of more than 80% of the common stock of a new entity, which has since been named Baxalta and was formed to hold the assets and liabilities associated with the biopharmaceuticals business. On June 5, 2015, the Baxter Board of Directors approved the distribution of the issued and outstanding shares of Baxalta common stock on the basis of one share of Baxaltas common stock for each share of Baxter common stock held as of the close of business on the record date of June 17, 2015. On July 1, 2015, the distribution date, each Baxter shareholder will receive one share of Baxaltas common stock for each share of Baxter common stock held at the close of business on the record date. Baxter shareholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Baxalta common stock which they would have received after application of this ratio. Shareholders will not be required to make any payment, surrender or exchange your shares of Baxter common stock or take any other action to receive their shares of Baxaltas common stock in the distribution. The distribution of Baxaltas common stock as described in this prospectus is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions. For a more detailed description of these conditions, see this section under Conditions to the Distribution. Reasons for the Separation The Baxter Board of Directors determined that the separation of Baxters biopharmaceuticals business from its medical products businesses would be in the best interests of Baxter and its shareholders and approved the plan of separation. A wide variety of factors were considered by the Baxter Board of Directors in evaluating the separation. Among other things, the Baxter Board of Directors considered the following potential benefits of the separation:  the separation will allow greater management focus on the distinct businesses of biopharmaceuticals and medical products by Baxalta and Baxter, respectively;  the separation will give each of Baxter and Baxalta the ability to commercialize new and existing product offerings more effectively on a global basis;  the separation will give each of Baxter and Baxalta the ability to drive innovation and allocate necessary resources to areas presenting the highest growth potential;  the separation will give each of Baxter and Baxalta the flexibility to pursue aligned growth and investment strategies resulting in revenue acceleration, improved profitability and enhanced returns;  the separation will allow each of Baxter and Baxalta to capitalize on emerging healthcare trends while enhancing operational, commercial and scientific effectiveness;  the separation will allow investors to separately value each of Baxter and Baxalta based on their unique investment identities, including the merits, performance and future prospects of their respective businesses, providing investors with two distinct and targeted investment opportunities; 139 Table of Contents  after the separation, each of Baxter and Baxalta will generate strong cash flow and be well capitalized with a strong balance sheet, an investment-grade profile and a disciplined approach to capital allocation;  the separation will create an independent equity structure that will afford Baxalta direct access to the capital markets and facilitate the ability to capitalize on its unique growth opportunities and effect future acquisitions using its common stock. Neither Baxalta nor Baxter can make any assurances that, following the separation, any of the benefits described above or otherwise will be realized to the extent anticipated or at all. The Baxter Board of Directors also considered a number of potentially negative factors in evaluating the separation, including the one-time costs associated with preparing Baxalta to become an independent public company, the potential for increased operating costs, the time it may take for Baxalta to attract an optimal shareholder base, the possibility of disruptions in the Baxalta business as a result of the separation and distribution, the risk that the combined trading prices of Baxters common stock and Baxaltas common stock after the distribution may drop below the trading price of Baxters common stock before the distribution and the loss of synergies and scale from operating as one company. Notwithstanding these costs and risks, taking into account the factors discussed above, the Baxter Board of Directors determined that the separation and distribution was in the best interests of Baxter and its shareholders and approved the plan of separation. Formation of a New Company Prior to Baxaltas Distribution Baxalta was incorporated in Delaware on September 8, 2014 for the purpose of holding Baxters biopharmaceuticals business. As part of the plan to separate the biopharmaceuticals business of Baxter from the remainder of its businesses, Baxter plans to transfer the equity interests of certain entities that operate the biopharmaceuticals business and certain other assets and liabilities of the biopharmaceuticals business to Baxalta in one or more transfers prior to the distribution in exchange for Baxalta stock, Baxalta debt instruments, all or a portion of the proceeds received by Baxalta from third-party borrowings and the assumption of certain Baxalta Liabilities (as defined in the separation and distribution agreement). When and How Will the Distribution Occur With the assistance of Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (Computershare), the settlement and distribution agent, Baxter expects to distribute Baxalta common stock on July 1, 2015, the distribution date, to all holders of outstanding shares of Baxter common stock as of the close of business on June 17, 2015, the record date. Computershare, which currently serves as the transfer agent and registrar for Baxters common stock, will serve as the settlement and distribution agent in connection with the distribution and the transfer agent and registrar for Baxalta common stock. For shareholders who own shares of Baxter common stock as of the close of business on the record date, the shares of Baxaltas common stock that such shareholder is entitled to receive in the distribution will be issued electronically, as of the distribution date, to such shareholder in direct registration form or to such shareholders bank or brokerage firm on the shareholders behalf. For shareholders who are registered holders, Computershare will then mail such shareholders a direct registration account statement that reflects such shares of Baxalta common stock. Direct registration form refers to a method of recording share ownership when no physical share certificates are issued to shareholders, as is the case in the distribution. Commencing on or shortly after the distribution date, for shareholders holding physical share certificates that represent their shares of Baxter common stock and are the registered holder of the shares represented by those certificates, the distribution agent will mail to such shareholders an account statement that indicates the number of shares of Baxaltas common stock that have been registered in book-entry form in their names. Shareholders who elect to sell shares of Baxter common stock in the regular-way market on or prior to the time of the distribution will be selling their right to receive shares of Baxalta common stock in the distribution. 140 Table of Contents For any shares of Baxter common stock that are held in a shareholders Baxter dividend reinvestment account as of the close of business on the record date, such shareholder will receive shares of Baxalta common stock in a new Baxalta dividend reinvestment program account that will be created for such shareholder. Most Baxter shareholders hold their common stock through a bank or brokerage firm. In such cases, the bank or brokerage firm would be said to hold the shares in street name and ownership would be recorded on the bank or brokerage firms books. For shareholders holding their shares of Baxter common stock through a bank or brokerage firm, such bank or brokerage firm will credit such shareholders account for the Baxalta common stock that such shareholder is entitled to receive in the distribution. Transferability of Baxalta Shares Received in the Distribution Shares of Baxalta common stock distributed to shareholders in connection with the distribution will be transferable without registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, except for shares received by persons who may be deemed to be Baxalta affiliates. Persons who may be deemed to be Baxalta affiliates after the distribution generally include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with Baxalta, which may include certain Baxalta executive officers, directors or principal shareholders. Securities held by Baxalta affiliates will be subject to resale restrictions under the Securities Act. Baxalta affiliates will be permitted to sell shares of Baxalta common stock only pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, such as the exemption afforded by Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The Number of Shares of Baxalta Common Stock Shareholders Will Receive For each share of Baxter common stock outstanding at the close of business on June 17, 2015, the record date, one share of Baxalta common stock will be distributed on the distribution date. To avoid the administrative difficulties and costs associated with the issuance and maintenance of fractional shares of Baxalta common stock, Baxter will distribute any fractional shares of Baxalta common stock to a distribution agent (acting on behalf of Baxter shareholders), who will aggregate fractional shares into whole shares, sell the whole shares in the open market at prevailing market prices and distribute the aggregate cash proceeds (net of discounts and commissions) of the sales pro rata (based on the fractional share such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive) to each holder who otherwise would have been entitled to receive a fractional share in the distribution. The distribution agent, in its sole discretion, without any influence by Baxter or Baxalta, will determine when, how, through which broker-dealer and at what price to sell the whole shares. Any broker-dealer used by the distribution agent will not be an affiliate of either Baxter or Baxalta. Neither Baxalta nor Baxter will be able to guarantee any minimum sale price in connection with the sale of these shares. Recipients of cash in lieu of fractional shares will not be entitled to any interest on the amounts of payment made in lieu of fractional shares. The aggregate net cash proceeds of these sales will be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For a holder of physical certificates for shares of Baxter common stock who is also the registered holder, such holder will receive a check from the distribution agent in an amount equal to such holders pro rata share of the aggregate net cash proceeds of the sales. Baxalta estimates that it will take approximately two weeks from the distribution date for the distribution agent to complete the distributions of the aggregate net cash proceeds. For a holder of shares of Baxter common stock through a bank or brokerage firm, such holders bank or brokerage firm will receive, on behalf of such holder, such holders pro rata share of the aggregate net cash proceeds of the sales and will electronically credit such holders account for such holders share of such proceeds. 141 Table of Contents Results of the Distribution After the distribution, Baxalta will be an independent, publicly traded company. The actual number of shares to be distributed will be determined at the close of business on June 17, 2015, the record date for the distribution, and will reflect any exercise of Baxter options between the date the Baxter Board of Directors declares the distribution and the record date for the distribution. The distribution will not affect the number of outstanding shares of Baxter common stock or any rights of Baxters shareholders. Except as described herein, Baxter will not distribute any fractional shares of Baxalta common stock. Baxalta will enter into the separation agreement with Baxter and will enter into other agreements with Baxter before the distribution to effect the separation and provide a framework for Baxaltas relationship with Baxter after the distribution. These agreements will provide for the allocation between Baxter and Baxalta of Baxters assets, liabilities and obligations (including employee benefits, intellectual property, and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to Baxaltas separation from Baxter and will govern the relationship between Baxter and Baxalta after the distribution. For a more detailed description of these agreements, see Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions. Market for Baxalta Common Stock There is currently no public trading market for Baxaltas common stock on a regular-way basis, although there is a limited when-issued market for such shares that is expected to continue until the distribution. Baxaltas common stock has been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BXLT. Baxalta has not and will not set the initial price of its common stock. The initial price will be established by the public markets. Baxalta cannot predict the price at which its common stock will trade after the distribution. In fact, the combined trading prices, after the distribution, of the shares of Baxalta common stock that each Baxter shareholder will receive in the distribution and the shares of Baxter common stock held at the record date may not equal the regular-way trading price of a Baxter share immediately prior to the distribution. The price at which Baxalta common stock trades may fluctuate significantly, particularly until an orderly public market develops. Trading prices for Baxalta common stock will be determined in the public markets and may be influenced by many factors. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to Baxaltas Common Stock. Trading Between the Record Date and Distribution Date Beginning on June 15, 2015 and expected to continue until the time of the distribution, there will be two markets in shares of Baxter common stock: a regular-way market and an ex-distribution market. Shares of Baxter common stock that trade on the regular-way market will trade with an entitlement to Baxalta common stock distributed pursuant to the distribution. Shares of Baxter common stock that trade on the ex-distribution market will trade without an entitlement to Baxalta common stock distributed pursuant to the distribution. Therefore, if a shareholder sells shares of Baxter common stock in the regular-way market on or prior to the time of the distribution, such shareholder will be selling the right to receive Baxalta common stock in the distribution. If a shareholder own shares of Baxter common stock at the close of business on the record date and sells those shares on the ex-distribution market on or prior to the time of the distribution, such shareholder will receive the shares of Baxalta common stock that such shareholder is entitled to receive pursuant to such shareholders ownership as of the record date of the shares of Baxter common stock. Furthermore, beginning on June 15, 2015 and expected to continue until the time of the distribution, there will be a when-issued market in Baxaltas common stock. When-issued trading refers to a sale or purchase made conditionally because the security has been authorized but not yet issued. The when-issued trading market will be a market for Baxalta common stock that will be distributed to holders of Baxter common stock on the distribution date. Shareholders who owned Baxter common stock at the close of business on the record date are entitled to Baxalta common stock distributed pursuant to the distribution. Such a shareholder may trade this 142 Table of Contents entitlement to shares of Baxalta common stock, without the shares of Baxter common stock such shareholder owns, on the when-issued market. Upon completion of the distribution, when-issued trading with respect to Baxalta common stock will end, and regular-way trading will begin. Conditions to the Distribution Baxalta has announced that the distribution will be effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time, on July 1, 2015, which is the distribution date, provided that the following conditions shall have been satisfied (or waived by Baxter in its sole discretion):  the receipt of an opinion from tax counsel or other third party advisor to Baxter that is in substance and form satisfactory to Baxter;  the receipt and continuing validity of a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service regarding certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the spin-off and certain related transactions under Sections 332, 355, 361 or 368, or related provisions, of the Code;  the making of a cash distribution of approximately $4 billion from Baxalta to Baxter as partial consideration for the contribution of assets to Baxalta by Baxter in connection with the separation, and the determination by Baxter in its sole discretion that following the separation Baxter will have no further liability or obligation whatsoever with respect to any of the financing arrangements that Baxalta will be entering into in connection with the separation;  the receipt of an opinion from an independent appraisal firm to the Baxter Board of Directors confirming the solvency and financial viability of Baxter before the distribution and each of Baxter and Baxalta after the distribution that is in form and substance acceptable to Baxter in its sole discretion;  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declaring effective Baxaltas registration statement on Form 10, and the making available of the information statement forming a part of such registration statement to all holders of record of shares of Baxter common stock as of the close of business on June 17, 2015, the record date;  no order, injunction, or decree issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the separation, distribution or any of the related transactions shall be in effect;  the shares of Baxalta common stock to be distributed shall have been accepted for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of distribution; and  no other event or development existing or having occurred that, in the judgment of Baxters Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, makes it inadvisable to effect the separation, distribution and other related transactions. Baxter will have the sole and absolute discretion to determine (and change) the terms of, and whether to proceed with, the distribution and, to the extent it determines to so proceed, to determine the record date and the distribution date and the distribution ratio. Baxter does not intend to notify its shareholders of any modifications to the terms of the separation that, in the judgment of its Board of Directors, are not material. For example, the Baxter Board of Directors might consider material such matters as significant changes to the distribution ratio, the assets to be contributed or the liabilities to be assumed in the separation. To the extent that the Baxter Board of Directors determines that any modifications by Baxter materially change the material terms of the distribution, Baxter will notify Baxter shareholders in a manner reasonably calculated to inform them about the modification as may be required by law, by, for example, publishing a press release, filing a current report on Form 8-K, or circulating a supplement to this prospectus. 143 Table of Contents DESCRIPTION OF MATERIAL INDEBTEDNESS Senior Notes Issuance On June 23, 2015, Baxalta issued senior notes with a total aggregate principal amount of $5 billion, of which approximately $4 billion was paid to Baxter as a cash distribution as partial consideration for the contribution of assets to Baxalta by Baxter in connection with the separation. Baxalta intends to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to fund acquisitions. Baxaltas debt balance as of the distribution date will be determined based on internal capital planning and take into account factors and assumptions including the anticipated business plan, optimal debt levels, operating activities, general economic contingencies, credit rating and desired financing capacity. The senior notes are governed by an indenture dated as of June 23, 2015 between Baxalta and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated June 23, 2015 (collectively, the Indenture). The following is a description of the material terms of the senior notes, which description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Indenture and the registration rights agreement described below, which are incorporated by reference into this prospectus. On June 23, 2015, Baxalta issued $5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes consisting of the following series:  $375 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2018 (the Floating Rate Notes);  $375 million aggregate principal amount of 2.000% senior notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes);  $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes);  $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.600% senior notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes);  $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.000% senior notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes); and  $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior notes due 2045 (the 2045 Notes, and together with the 2018 Notes, the 2020 Notes, the 2022 Notes and the 2025 Notes, the Fixed Rate Notes). The senior notes were issued and sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. Baxter has guaranteed each series of senior notes on a senior unsecured, unsubordinated basis, and such guarantee will automatically terminate upon the distribution. Baxalta may not redeem the Floating Rate Notes prior to maturity. Baxalta may redeem the 2018 Notes at any time prior to their maturity date, the 2020 Notes at any time prior to the date that is one month prior to their maturity date, the 2022 Notes at any time prior to the date that is two months prior to their maturity date, the 2025 Notes at any time prior to the date that is three months prior to their maturity date and the 2045 Notes at any time prior to the date that is six months prior to their maturity date, in whole at any time or in part, from time to time, at Baxaltas option, at the applicable make-whole redemption price. On or after the date that is one month prior to their maturity date, in the case of the 2020 Notes, two months prior to their maturity date, in the case of the 2022 Notes, three months prior to their maturity date, in the case of the 2025 Notes and six months prior to their maturity date, in the case of the 2045 Notes, such Notes will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part, from time to time, at Baxaltas option at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption. 144 Table of Contents Subject to certain qualifications and exceptions, the Indenture limits Baxaltas ability and the ability of Baxaltas subsidiaries to create or permit to exist mortgages with respect to principal domestic properties and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal domestic properties, and limits Baxaltas ability to merge or consolidate with any other entity or convey, transfer or lease Baxaltas properties and assets substantially as an entirety. The Indenture also provides for certain events of default with respect to each series of senior notes (subject, in certain cases, to receipt of notice of default and/or customary grace or cure periods), including, but not limited to, (i) failure to pay interest for 30 days, (ii) failure to pay principal when due, (iii) failure to perform, or breach of, any other covenant or warranty in the Indenture for 90 days after notice is given by the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior notes of such series and (iv) certain specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Baxalta. In connection with the issuance of the senior notes, Baxalta and Baxter agreed with the initial purchasers under a registration rights agreement to (i) use their reasonable best efforts to cause to be filed a registration statement on an appropriate registration form with respect to a registered offer to exchange the senior notes for new notes, with terms substantially identical in all material respects to the senior notes and (ii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to have such registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act. If the exchange offer is not completed on or before June 17, 2016, Baxalta and Baxter will use their reasonable best efforts to file and will use their commercially reasonable efforts to have become effective a shelf registration statement relating to the resales of the senior notes. The foregoing summarizes some of the terms of Baxaltas notes. However, the foregoing summary does not purport to be complete. Credit Agreements The following summary sets forth information based on Baxaltas current expectations about the financing arrangements anticipated to be entered into prior to the distribution. However, Baxalta has not yet entered into any definitive agreements with respect to such financing arrangements, and, accordingly, the terms of such financing arrangements have not yet been determined, remain under discussion and are subject to change, including as a result of market conditions. Prior to the distribution, Baxalta also expects to enter into a credit agreement providing for a five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.2 billion (and which may from time to time be increased by up to $625 million), as well as a five-year, multi-currency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 200 million (and which may from time to time be increased by up to 100 million). The terms of the revolving credit facilities have not yet been finalized. There may be changes to the expected size and other terms of the credit agreement, some of which may be material. 145 Table of Contents DESCRIPTION OF BAXALTAS CAPITAL STOCK Baxaltas certificate of incorporation and bylaws will be amended and restated prior to the distribution. The following is a summary of the material terms of Baxaltas capital stock that will be contained in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The summaries and descriptions below do not purport to be complete statements of the relevant provisions of the certificate of incorporation or of the bylaws to be in effect at the time of the distribution. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to these documents, which you must read (along with the applicable provisions of Delaware law) for complete information on Baxaltas capital stock as of the time of the distribution. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws to be in effect at the time of the distribution are included as exhibits to Baxaltas registration statement on Form S-1, of which this prospectus forms a part. General Baxaltas authorized capital stock consists of 2.5 billion shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 100 million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which shares of preferred stock are undesignated. Baxaltas Board of Directors may establish the rights and preferences of the preferred stock from time to time. Immediately following the distribution, Baxalta expects that approximately 676,424,202 shares of its common stock will be issued and outstanding and that no shares of preferred stock will be issued and outstanding. Common Stock Each holder of Baxalta common stock will be entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted upon by the holders of Baxalta common stock, and there will be no cumulative voting rights. Subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding preferred stock, holders of Baxalta common stock will be entitled to receive ratably the dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by its Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. If there is a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Baxalta, holders of its common stock would be entitled to ratable distribution of its assets remaining after the payment in full of liabilities and any preferential rights of any then outstanding preferred stock. Holders of Baxalta common stock will have no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. After the distribution, all outstanding shares of Baxalta common stock will be fully paid and non-assessable. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of Baxalta common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that Baxalta may designate and issue in the future. Preferred Stock Under the terms of Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation, its Board of Directors will be authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, and by its amended and restated certificate of incorporation, to issue up to 100 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further action by the holders of its common stock. Baxaltas Board of Directors will have the discretion, subject to limitations prescribed by the DGCL and by Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation, to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, of each series of preferred stock. Anti-Takeover Effects of Various Provisions of Delaware Law and Baxaltas Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws Provisions of the DGCL and Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult to acquire Baxalta by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, or to remove 146 Table of Contents incumbent officers and directors. These provisions, summarized below, are expected to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and takeover bids that its Board of Directors may consider inadequate and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of the company to first negotiate with Baxaltas Board of Directors. Baxalta believes that the benefits of increased protection of its ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure it outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging takeover or acquisition proposals because, among other things, negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute. Baxalta will be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, an anti-takeover statute. In general, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the time the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination or the acquisition of shares that resulted in a stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Generally, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status did own) 15 percent or more of a corporations voting stock. The existence of this provision would be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by Baxaltas Board of Directors, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by Baxaltas shareholders. Classified Board. Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will provide that its Board of Directors will be divided into three classes. At the time of the distribution, Baxaltas Board of Directors will be divided into three classes. The two directors designated as directors in the first of the three classes will have terms expiring at the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders. The three directors designated as directors in the second of the three classes will have terms expiring at the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, and the two directors designated as directors in the third of the three classes will have terms expiring at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. Commencing with the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders, directors for each class will be elected at the annual meeting of shareholders held in the year in which the term for that class expires and thereafter will serve for a term of three years. At any meeting of shareholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, the election will be determined by a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote in the election, with directors not receiving a majority of the votes cast required to tender their resignations for consideration by the Board, except that in the case of a contested election, the election will be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote in the election. Under the classified Board provisions, it would take at least two elections of directors for any individual or group to gain control of Baxaltas Board of Directors. Accordingly, these provisions could discourage a third party from initiating a proxy contest, making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to gain control of Baxalta. Removal of Directors. Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that its shareholders may only remove its directors for cause. Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation. Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of its voting stock then outstanding is required to amend certain provisions, including relating to the number, term and removal of its directors, the filling of its Board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of shareholders, shareholder action by written consent, director and officer indemnification, and the amendment, adoption, alternation or repeal of Baxaltas amended and restated bylaws. Amendments to Bylaws. Baxaltas by-laws will provide that they may be amended, adopted, altered or repealed by Baxaltas Board of Directors or may be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 80% of Baxaltas shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at any meeting of the shareholders if notice of such proposed amendment or repeal is contained in the notice of such meeting. 147 Table of Contents Size of Board and Vacancies. Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the number of directors on its Board of Directors will be fixed exclusively by its Board of Directors at a number of directors not less than four (4) and not more than thirteen (13). Any vacancies created in its Board of Directors resulting from any increase in the number of directors or the death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause will be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum is present, or by a sole remaining director. Any director appointed to fill a vacancy on Baxaltas Board of Directors will be appointed for a term expiring at the next election of the class for which such director has been appointed, and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified. Special Shareholder Meetings. Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that only the chairman of its Board of Directors, its chief executive officer or its Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board of Directors may call special meetings of Baxalta shareholders. Shareholders may not call special shareholder meetings. Shareholder Action by Written Consent. Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation will expressly eliminate the right of its shareholders to act by written consent. Shareholder action must take place at a duly called annual meeting or a special meeting of Baxalta shareholders. Requirements for Advance Notification of Shareholder Nominations and Proposals. Baxaltas amended and restated by-laws will establish advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals and nomination of candidates for election as directors other than nominations made by or at the direction of its Board of Directors or a committee of its Board of Directors. No Cumulative Voting. The DGCL provides that shareholders are denied the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors unless the companys certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not provide for cumulative voting. Undesignated Preferred Stock. The authority that Baxaltas Board of Directors will possess to issue preferred stock could potentially be used to discourage attempts by third parties to obtain control of Baxaltas company through a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making such attempts more difficult or more costly. Baxaltas Board of Directors may be able to issue preferred stock with voting rights or conversion rights that, if exercised, could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock. Limitations on Liability, Indemnification of Officers and Directors, and Insurance The DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their shareholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors fiduciary duties as directors, and Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation will include such an exculpation provision. Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws will include provisions that indemnify, to the fullest extent allowable under the DGCL, the personal liability of directors or officers of Baxalta or any of its subsidiaries, and any director, officer or employee of Baxalta serving at Baxaltas request as a director, officer, employee or agent of, or in a fiduciary capacity with respect to, another entity. Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws will also provide that Baxalta must pay and advance the expenses incurred by the indemnified person in defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, subject to its receipt of an undertaking from the indemnified party that such party will repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that such party is not entitled to be indemnified by Baxalta. Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation will expressly authorize Baxalta to carry insurance to protect Baxalta, its directors, officers and employees, and any director, officer or employee of Baxalta serving at Baxaltas request as a director, officer, employee or agent of, or in a fiduciary capacity with respect to, another entity. The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions that will be in Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for 148 Table of Contents breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against Baxaltas directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit Baxalta and its shareholders. However, these provisions will not limit or eliminate Baxaltas rights, or those of any shareholder, to seek non-monetary relief such as injunction or rescission in the event of a breach of a directors duty of care. The provisions will not alter the liability of directors under the federal securities laws. In addition, investments in Baxalta may be adversely affected to the extent that, in a class action or direct suit, the company pays the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions. Exclusive Forum Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that unless the Board of Directors otherwise determines, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Baxalta, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director or officer of Baxalta to Baxalta or Baxaltas shareholders, creditors or other constituents, any action asserting a claim against Baxalta or any current or former director or officer of Baxalta arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against Baxalta or any current or former director or officer of Baxalta that relates to the internal affairs or governance of Baxalta that arises under or by virtue of the laws of the State of Delaware. However, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware dismisses any such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the action may be brought in another state court sitting in the State of Delaware. Authorized but Unissued Shares Baxaltas authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock will be available for future issuance without shareholder approval unless otherwise required by applicable law, including any stock exchange requirement. Baxalta may use additional shares for a variety of purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, to fund acquisitions and as employee compensation. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of Baxalta by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. Listing Baxaltas common stock has been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BXLT. Sale of Unregistered Securities In connection with the formation of Baxalta on September 8, 2014, Baxalta issued 100 shares of its common stock to Baxter pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. Baxalta did not register this issuance of the issued shares under the Securities Act because such issuance did not constitute a public offering. On June 23, 2015, Baxalta issued $5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes pursuant to an exemption under the Securities Act.

Acquired Hemophilia A : A rare, potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder, which, unlike congenital hemophilia, typically affects older adults and occurs in both males and females. In acquired hemophilia A, individuals typically experience subcutaneous, soft tissue, and post-surgical bleeding. The comorbidities in this typically elderly population also pose a particular challenge to treat serious bleeding episodes. Biologics : Medical products made from a variety of natural sources (human, animal or microorganism) intended to treat diseases and medical conditions or used to prevent or diagnose diseases; products include vaccines, blood and blood products, allergenic extracts, human cells and tissues, gene therapies and cellular therapies. Biosimilars : A biological product that is highly similar to a U.S.-licensed reference biological product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. Extended Half-Life : Prolonged circulation of the replacement clotting factor therapy in the body. Hemophilia A : The most common type of hemophilia which occurs when clotting factor VIII (fVIII), a naturally occurring protein in blood that controls bleeding, is not present in sufficient amounts or is absent. Without enough fVIII, people with hemophilia can experience spontaneous, uncontrolled internal bleeding that is painful, debilitating, damaging to joints and potentially fatal. Hemophilia B : The second most common type of hemophilia (also known as Christmas disease) and the result of insufficient amounts of clotting factor IX, a naturally occurring protein in blood that controls bleeding. Hemophilia B is often a debilitating, chronic disease with complications that include bleeding episodes, hemophilic arthropathy (bleeding into a joint) and hospitalization. Hyaluronidase : A naturally occurring enzyme that temporarily locally degrades hyaluronan (a naturally occurring space-filling, gel-like substance that is a major component of normal tissues throughout the body, such as skin and cartilage, and abnormal tissues, such as tumors) thereby facilitating the penetration and diffusion of other drugs and fluids that are injected under the skin. Hypoalbumenia : A medical condition where levels of albumin in blood serum are abnormally low. Hypogammaglobulinemia : Type of primary immunodeficiency disease with a predisposition toward infections that normally are defended against by antibody responses. Hypovolemia : An abnormal decrease in the volume of blood plasma. Inhibitor Management Therapy : The development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII (fVIII) or factor IX (fIX) is the most significant complication of hemophilia treatment. The major morbidity that results from the development of an inhibitor in patients with hemophilia is bleeding that is difficult to treat. Inhibitor management relies initially on immune tolerance induction, particularly in patients with severe Hemophilia A. Failing that, management depends on hemostatic therapies that bypass the missing clotting factor. Bypassing agents treat bleeding by producing thrombin via pathways that do not require fVIII or fIX, and include recombinant factor VIIa and activated prothrombin complex concentrates. Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) : A rare, auto immune-mediated disorder characterized by slowly progressive, asymmetric, distal weakness of one or more limbs, most commonly starting with the arms, leading 151 Table of Contents to significant difficulty with simple manual tasks. MMN is caused by disorder/malfunctions in the conduction pathway of motor nerves, limiting transmission of electrical impulses and if left untreated, often progresses to more severe weakness, including muscle atrophy, involuntary twitching and cramps. Pharmacokinetic : The rate and extent to which a drugs active ingredient is made available to the body and the way it is distributed in, metabolized by, and eliminated from the human body. Primary Immunodeficiency (PID) : A group of over 150 diseases in which part of the bodys immune system is missing or does not function properly. Normally, the immune system protects the body from pathogenic microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, and fungi, which can cause infectious diseases. When any part of a persons immune system is absent or dysfunctional, they are more likely to become infected and may take longer to recover from infections. When a defect in the immune system is inherited, it is called primary immunodeficiency. von Willebrand Disease (VWD) : An autosomal genetic disorder related to quantitative deficits and/or qualitative defects of von Willebrand Factor, the result of which is impaired hemostasis. It is the most common hereditary coagulation disorder. Many people who have VWD may experience mild symptoms, but some patients can experience severe bleeding events similar to bleeding experienced by patients with hemophilia. 152 Table of Contents INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AUDITED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Financial Statements F-2 Combined Balance Sheets F-3 Combined Statements of Income F-4 Combined Statements of Comprehensive Income F-5 Combined Statements of Cash Flows F-6 Combined Statements of Changes in Equity F-7 Notes to Combined Financial Statements F-8 UNAUDITED CONDENSED COMBINED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Condensed Combined Balance Sheets F-36 Condensed Combined Statements of Income F-37 Condensed Combined Statements of Comprehensive Income F-38 Condensed Combined Statements of Cash Flows F-39 Condensed Combined Statements of Changes in Equity F-40 Notes to Condensed Combined Financial Statements F-41 F-1 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Baxter International Inc.

F-7 Table of Contents THE BIOPHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS OF BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PREPARATION On March 27, 2014, Baxter International Inc. (Baxter or the Parent) announced its plan to create two separate, independent public companies with one focused on developing and marketing biopharmaceuticals and the other on diversified medical products. Under the separation plan, Baxter will spin off its biopharmaceuticals business into Baxalta Incorporated (Baxalta), a wholly owned subsidiary of Baxter that was incorporated on September 8, 2014. The combined biopharmaceuticals business of Baxter is referred to throughout these combined financial statements as the Company. To accomplish the separation, Baxter intends to make a pro rata distribution of more than 80% of Baxaltas common stock to Baxters shareholders. At the time of the distribution, Baxalta will hold the assets and liabilities associated with Baxters biopharmaceuticals business. The distribution is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of a favorable opinion or ruling with respect to the tax-free nature of the distribution and approval by the Baxter Board of Directors. Nature of Business The principal business of the Company is the development, manufacture and marketing of a diverse portfolio of treatments for hemophilia and other bleeding disorders, immune deficiencies, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, burns and shock, and other chronic and acute medical conditions. The Company is also investing in new disease areas, including oncology, as well as emerging technology platforms, including gene therapy and biosimilars. The Companys business strategy is aimed at improving diagnosis, treatment and standards of care across a wide range of bleeding disorders and other rare chronic and acute medical conditions, capitalizing on the Companys differentiated portfolio, ensuring the sustainability of supply to meet growing demand for therapies across core disease areas, and accelerating innovation by developing and launching new treatments while leveraging its expertise into new emerging therapeutics through acquisitions and collaborations. The Companys primary manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, Austria, Switzerland, Singapore and Belgium. The Company distributes its products through its own direct sales force, independent distributors and drug wholesalers, and sells to customers throughout the world. Basis of Preparation The accompanying combined financial statements have been prepared on a standalone basis and are derived from Baxters consolidated financial statements and accounting records. The combined financial statements reflect the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows as the business was operated as part of Baxter prior to the distribution, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). These combined financial statements include the attribution of certain assets and liabilities that have historically been held at the Baxter corporate level but which are specifically identifiable or attributable to the Company. All intercompany transactions and accounts within the Company have been eliminated. All transactions between the Company and Baxter are considered to be effectively settled in the combined financial statements at the time the transaction is recorded. The total net effect of the settlement of these intercompany transactions is reflected in the combined statements of cash flows as a financing activity and in the combined balance sheets as net parent company investment. These combined financial statements include an allocation of expenses related to certain Baxter corporate functions, including executive oversight, treasury, finance, legal, human resources, tax planning, internal audit, F-8 Table of Contents financial reporting, information technology and investor relations. These expenses have been allocated to the Company based on direct usage or benefit where specifically identifiable, with the remainder allocated primarily on a pro rata basis of revenue, headcount, square footage, or other measures. The Company considers the expense methodology and results to be reasonable for all periods presented. However, the allocations may not be indicative of the actual expense that would have been incurred had the Company operated as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented. The income tax amounts in these combined financial statements have been calculated based on a separate return methodology and presented as if the Companys operations were separate taxpayers in the respective jurisdictions. Baxter maintains various benefit and share-based compensation plans at a corporate level and other benefit plans at a country level. The Companys employees participate in such programs and a portion of the cost of those plans is included in the Companys financial statements. However, the combined balance sheets do not include any equity related to share-based compensation plans or any net benefit plan obligations unless the benefit plan covers only active and inactive employees of the Company. The Companys equity balance in these combined financial statements represents the excess of total assets over total liabilities, including the due to/from balances between the Company and Baxter (net parent company investment) and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). Net parent company investment is primarily impacted by contributions from Baxter which are the result of treasury activities and net funding provided by or distributed to Baxter. NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenues from product sales and services when earned. Specifically, revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred (or services have been rendered), the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. For product sales, revenue is not recognized until title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. The shipping terms for the majority of the Companys revenue arrangements are FOB destination. Provisions for rebates, chargebacks to wholesalers and distributors, returns, and discounts are provided for at the time the related sales are recorded, and are reflected as a reduction of sales. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts In the normal course of business, the Company provides credit to its customers and maintains reserves for potential credit losses. The movement in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the periods presented is as follows: years ended of December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 Balance at beginning of year $ 21 $ 20 $ 19 Additions 3 2 2 Deductions from reserves (4 ) (1 ) (1 ) Balance at end of year $ 20 $ 21 $ 20 F-9 Table of Contents Inventories as of December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 Raw materials $ 524 $ 529 Work in process 976 971 Finished goods 460 422 Total $ 1,960 $ 1,922 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market value. Market value for raw materials is based on replacement costs, and market value for work in process and finished goods is based on net realizable value. Property, Plant and Equipment, Net as of December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 Land $ 105 $ 99 Buildings and leasehold improvements 1,260 1,240 Machinery and equipment 2,259 2,101 Construction in progress 2,109 1,518 Total property, plant and equipment, at cost 5,733 4,958 Accumulated depreciation (1,541 ) (1,582 ) Property, plant and equipment (PP&E), net $ 4,192 $ 3,376 Depreciation expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 20 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and from three to 15 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the related facility lease (including any renewal periods, if appropriate) or the asset, whichever is shorter. Machinery and equipment includes capitalized software costs, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software. Depreciation expense was $189 million in 2014, $168 million in 2013, and $150 million in 2012. Gross assets recorded under capital leases and reported in buildings and leasehold improvements were $283 million and $20 million as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, and associated accumulated depreciation was $3 million and $1 million as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Acquisitions Results of operations of acquired companies are included in the Companys results of operations as of the respective acquisition dates. The purchase price of each acquisition is allocated to the net assets acquired based on estimates of their fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any purchase price in excess of these net assets is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of purchase price in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair values during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date. Contingent consideration is recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent considerations are recognized in earnings. Research and Development Research and development (R&D) costs are expensed as incurred. Pre-regulatory approval contingent milestone obligations to counterparties in collaborative arrangements are expensed when the milestone is achieved. F-10 Table of Contents Payments made to counterparties on or after regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization. Acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D) is the value assigned to products under development acquired in a business combination which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use. Acquired IPR&D is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Development costs incurred after the acquisition date are expensed as incurred. Upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related product, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the related product, subject to annual impairment reviews as discussed below. If the R&D project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived asset is charged to expense. Collaborative Arrangements The Company enters into collaborative arrangements in the normal course of business. These collaborative arrangements take a number of forms and structures, and are designed to enhance and expedite long-term sales and profitability growth. These arrangements generally provide that the Company obtain commercialization rights to a product under development. The agreements often require the Company make upfront payments and include additional contingent milestone payments relating to the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalty payments. The Company may also be responsible for other on-going costs associated with the arrangements, including R&D cost reimbursements to the counterparty. Royalty payments are expensed as cost of sales when they become due and payable. Any purchases of product from the partner during the development stage are expensed as R&D, while such purchases during the commercialization phase are capitalized as inventory and recognized as cost of sales when the related finished products are sold. The Company presents upfront payments to collaboration partners as investing activities and milestone payments as operating activities in the combined statements of cash flows. Business Optimization Charges The Company records liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in the period in which the liability is incurred. Employee termination costs are primarily recorded when actions are probable and estimable. Costs for one-time termination benefits in which the employee is required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period. Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an impairment review annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill would be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit, calculated as the present value of estimated cash flows discounted using a risk-free market rate adjusted for a market participants view of similar companies and perceived risks in the cash flows. The implied fair value of goodwill is then determined by subtracting the fair value of all identifiable net assets other than goodwill from the fair value of the reporting unit, with an impairment charge recorded for the excess, if any, of carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value. Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization Indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as acquired IPR&D, are subject to an impairment review annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist. Indefinite-lived intangible assets would be impaired if the carrying amount of the asset exceeded the fair value of the asset. F-11 Table of Contents Other Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, other than goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In evaluating recoverability, the Company groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level such that the identifiable cash flows relating to the Company are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The Company then compares the carrying amounts of the assets or asset groups with the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows. In the event impairment exists, an impairment charge is recorded as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. Income Taxes In the Companys combined financial statements, income tax expense and deferred tax balances have been calculated on a separate return basis although the Companys operations have historically been included in the tax returns filed by the respective Baxter entities of which the Companys business is a part. In the future, as a standalone entity, the Company will file tax returns on its own behalf and its deferred taxes and effective tax rate may differ from those in historical periods. Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and rates. The Company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. With respect to uncertain tax positions, the Company determines whether the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. Any tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured and recognized in the combined financial statements at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The liability relating to uncertain tax positions is classified as current in the combined balance sheets to the extent the Company anticipates making a payment within one year. Interest and penalties associated with income taxes are classified in the income tax expense line in the combined statements of income. The Company maintains an income taxes payable to/from account with Baxter. The Company is deemed to settle current tax balances with the Baxter tax paying entities in the respective jurisdictions. The Companys current income tax balances are reflected as income taxes payable and settlements, which are deemed to occur in the year following incurrence, are reflected as changes in net parent company investment in the combined balance sheets. As a standalone entity, the Company will file tax returns on its own behalf and its deferred taxes and effective tax rate may differ from those in historical periods. Changes in Accounting Standards In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. ASU No. 201409 will be effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on its combined financial statements.

F-13 Table of Contents Chatham Therapeutics, LLC In May 2012, the Company entered into an exclusive global license agreement with Chatham Therapeutics, LLC (Chatham) to develop and commercialize potential treatments for hemophilia B utilizing Chathams gene therapy technology. The Company recognized an R&D charge of $30 million related to an upfront payment. In April 2014, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests in Chatham, obtaining all gene therapy programs related to the development and commercialization of treatments for hemophilia. The Company made an initial payment of $70 million, and may make additional payments of up to $560 million related to the achievement of development, regulatory and first commercial sale milestones, in addition to other sales milestones of up to $780 million. The estimated fair value of the contingent payment liabilities at the acquisition date was $77 million, which was recorded in long-term liabilities, and was calculated based on the probability of achieving the specified milestones and the discounting of expected future cash flows. As of December 31, 2014, there have been no significant changes to these contingent payment liabilities. The Company allocated $74 million of the total consideration to acquired IPR&D, which is being accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, with the residual consideration of $73 million recorded as goodwill. The acquired IPR&D primarily relates to Chathams hemophilia A (factor VIII) program, which was in preclinical stage at the time of the acquisition and is expected to be completed in approximately 10 years. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections adjusted for the inherent technical, regulatory, commercial and obsolescence risks in such activities, discounted at a rate of 12%. Additional R&D will be required prior to obtaining regulatory approval and, as of the acquisition date, incremental R&D costs were projected to be in excess of $130 million. The goodwill, which may be deductible for tax purposes depending on the ultimate resolution of the contingent payment liabilities, includes the value of potential future technologies as well as the overall strategic benefits of the acquisition to the Company in the hemophilia market. AesRx, LLC In June 2014, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests in AesRx, LLC (AesRx), obtaining AesRxs program related to the development and commercialization of treatments for sickle cell disease. The Company made an initial payment of $15 million, and may make additional payments of up to $278 million related to the achievement of development and regulatory milestones, in addition to sales milestones of up to $550 million. The estimated fair value of the contingent payment liabilities at the acquisition date was $65 million, which was recorded in long-term liabilities, and was calculated based on the probability of achieving the specified milestones and the discounting of expected future cash flows. As of December 31, 2014, there have been no significant changes to these contingent payment liabilities. The Company allocated $78 million of the total consideration to acquired IPR&D, which is being accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, with the residual consideration of $2 million recorded as goodwill. The acquired IPR&D relates to AesRxs sickle cell disease program, which was in Phase II clinical trials at the time of the acquisition, and was expected to be completed in approximately five years. The value of IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections adjusted for the inherent technical, regulatory, commercial and obsolescence risks in such activities, discounted at a rate of 15.5%. Additional R&D will be required prior to obtaining regulatory approval and, as of the acquisition date, incremental R&D costs were projected to be in excess of $40 million. Inspiration / Ipsen In March 2013, the investigational hemophilia compound OBIZUR and related assets were acquired from Inspiration BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (Inspiration), and certain other OBIZUR related assets, including F-14 Table of Contents manufacturing operations, were acquired from Ipsen Pharma S.A.S. (Ipsen) in conjunction with Inspirations bankruptcy proceedings. Ipsen was Inspirations senior secured creditor and had been providing Inspiration with debtor-in-possession financing to fund Inspirations operations and the sales process. Additionally, Ipsen was the owner of certain assets acquired in the transaction. OBIZUR is a recombinant porcine factor VIII that was approved in the United States in 2014 for the treatment of patients with acquired hemophilia A, and is being investigated for the treatment of congenital hemophilia A patients with inhibitors. The estimated fair value of contingent payment liabilities at the acquisition date was $269 million, based on the probability of achieving the specified milestones, of up to $135 million, and sales-based payments, and the discounting of expected future cash flows. The estimated fair value of contingent payment liabilities was recorded in other long-term liabilities as part of the consideration transferred. As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of the contingent payments was $386 million, with changes in the estimated fair value recognized in other expense, net within the combined statement of income. Refer to Note 8 for additional information regarding the contingent payment liability. Goodwill of $7 million principally included the value associated with the assembled workforce at the acquired manufacturing facility. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. Other intangible assets of $288 million related to acquired IPR&D activities, and the total was accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections adjusted for the inherent technical, regulatory, commercial and obsolescence risk associated with such activities, discounted at a rate of 13%. In 2014, the acquired IPR&D was reclassified as a definite-lived intangible asset following regulatory approval. Refer to Note 5 for further information regarding the reclassification to a definite-lived intangible asset. Collaborations The Companys significant arrangements are discussed below. Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In September 2014, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

NOTE 5 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET Goodwill The following is a summary of the activity in goodwill: (in millions) December 31, 2012 $ 512 Additions 7 Currency translation and other adjustments 5 December 31, 2013 524 Additions 75 Currency translation and other adjustments (34 ) December 31, 2014 $ 565 Goodwill additions in 2014 and 2013 primarily relate to the acquisitions of Chatham and Inspiration / Ipsen, respectively. See Note 4 for further information. As of December 31, 2014, there were no accumulated goodwill impairment losses. Other Intangible Assets, Net The following is a summary of the Companys other intangible assets: (in millions) Developed technology, including patents Other amortized intangible assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets Total December 31, 2014 Gross other intangible assets $ 440 $ 29 $ 149 $ 618 Accumulated amortization (133 ) (26 ) (159 ) Other intangible assets, net $ 307 $ 3 $ 149 $ 459 December 31, 2013 Gross other intangible assets $ 192 $ 33 $ 288 $ 513 Accumulated amortization (139 ) (25 )  (164 ) Other intangible assets, net $ 53 $ 8 $ 288 $ 349 Intangible asset amortization expense from continuing operations was $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2014 is $31 million in 2015, $28 million in 2016, $25 million in 2017, $24 million in 2018 and $21 million in 2019. The decrease in indefinite-lived intangible assets and corresponding increase in developed technology was primarily driven by the acquired IPR&D from the Inspiration / Ipsen acquisition obtaining regulatory approval. These intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of approximately 15 years. The decrease in indefinite-lived intangible assets was partially offset by additions related to the acquisitions of Chatham and AesRx. F-17 Table of Contents NOTE 6 BUSINESS OPTIMIZATION CHARGES The Company has historically participated in business optimization plans initiated by Baxter. The Companys total charges related to these plans are presented below: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 Cash expenses $ 43 $ 50 $ 30 Non-cash expenses  83 14 Reserve adjustments (10 )   Total business optimization expenses $ 33 $ 133 $ 44 Discontinued operations (8 ) (101 )  Business optimization expenses in continuing operations $ 25 $ 32 $ 44 These expenses primarily related to the Companys costs associated with optimizing the overall cost structure on a global basis, as Baxter streamlined its international operations, rationalized its manufacturing facilities, enhanced its general and administrative infrastructure and re-aligned or cancelled certain R&D activities and programs. The 2014 expenses primarily included severance and other employee-related costs associated with the reorganization of certain R&D activities. The 2013 expenses included severance costs, as well as asset impairments and contract terminations associated with discontinued products and projects. In 2014, the Company refined its expectations and recorded adjustments to previous business optimization reserves that are no longer probable of being utilized. The total business optimization charges for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, included severance and other non-cash impairment losses associated with the discontinuation of certain R&D programs associated with the vaccines business. The business optimization charges are recorded as follows in the combined statements of income:  2014: $2 million in cost of sales, $1 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, and $22 million in R&D expenses (with an additional $8 million recorded in discontinued operations).  2013: $5 million in cost of sales, $3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, and $24 million in R&D expenses (with an additional $101 million recorded in discontinued operations).  2012: $18 million in cost of sales, $10 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, and $16 million in R&D expenses. The following table summarizes cash activity in the reserves related to business optimization initiatives: (in millions) Reserve at December 31, 2011 $ 36 Current year charges 30 Utilization (21 ) Reserve at December 31, 2012 45 Current year charges 50 Utilization (31 ) Reserve at December 31, 2013 64 Current year charges 43 Reserve adjustments (10 ) Utilization (37 ) Reserve at December 31, 2014 $ 60 The reserves are expected to be substantially utilized by the end of 2016. The Company believes that the reserves are adequate. However, adjustments may be recorded in the future as the programs are completed. F-18 Table of Contents NOTE 7 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITY Interest Rate Risk Management The Company is exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in benchmark interest rates relating to its anticipated issuances of debt in connection with the separation. The Companys policy is to manage this risk to an acceptable level. Cash Flow Hedges In December 2014, the Company entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge the risk to earnings associated with movements in benchmark interest rates relating to the anticipated issuance of debt in connection with the separation. The Company designated these interest rate contracts as cash flow hedges. The total notional amount of the interest rate contracts outstanding was $550 million as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of the interest rate contracts in liability positions was $2 million, reported in accrued liabilities, and the fair value of the interest rate contracts in asset positions was $1 million, reported in prepaid expenses and other assets. The Company recorded a net loss of $1 million in other comprehensive income during the year ended December 31, 2014. There was no ineffectiveness during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company did not have any interest rate contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2013. NOTE 8 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company engages in business with foreign governments in certain countries that have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions, including Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Companys net accounts receivable from the public sector in these countries totaled $88 million and $146 million, respectively. Global economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses. Global economic conditions, governmental actions and customer-specific factors may require the Company to re-evaluate the collectability of its receivables and the Company could potentially incur additional credit losses. These conditions may also impact the stability of the Euro. Fair Value Measurements The fair value hierarchy under the accounting standard for fair value measurements consists of the following three levels:  Level 1Quoted prices in active markets that the Company has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities;  Level 2Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; and  Level 3Valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and include the use of judgment by the Companys management about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. F-19 Table of Contents The following tables summarize the bases used to measure financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the combined balance sheets: Basis of fair value measurement (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2014 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Assets Available-for-sale securities Equity securities $ 71 $ 71 $  $  Foreign government debt securities 18  18  Interest rate contracts 1  1  Total assets $ 90 $ 71 $ 19 $  Liabilities Contingent payments related to acquisitions $ 518 $  $  $ 518 Interest rate contracts 2  2  Total liabilities $ 520 $  $ 2 $ 518 Basis of fair value measurement (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2013 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Assets Available-for-sale securities Equity securities $ 94 $ 94 $  $  Foreign government debt securities 18  18  Total assets $ 112 $ 94 $ 18 $  Liabilities Contingent payments related to acquisitions $ 291 $  $  $ 291 Total liabilities $ 291 $  $  $ 291 For assets that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, the fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The fair values of foreign government debt securities are obtained from pricing services or broker/dealers who use proprietary pricing applications, which include observable market information for like or same securities. F-20 Table of Contents Contingent payments related to acquisitions consist of development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, in addition to sales-based payments, and are valued using discounted cash flow techniques. The fair value of development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments reflects managements expectations of probability of payment, and increases as the probability of payment increases or expectation of timing of payments is accelerated. As of December 31, 2014, managements expected weighted-average probability of payment for regulatory, development and commercial milestone payments expected to occur was approximately 24%, with individual probabilities ranging from 10%-100%. The fair value of sales-based payments is based upon probability-weighted future revenue estimates, and increases as revenue estimates increase, probability weighting of higher revenue scenarios increase or expectation of timing of payment is accelerated. The following table provides information relating to the Companys investments in available-for-sale equity securities: (in millions) Amortized cost Unrealized gains Unrealized (losses) Fair value December 31, 2014 Available-for-sale equity securities $ 59 $ 21 $ (9 ) $ 71 December 31, 2013 Available-for-sale equity securities $ 104 $ 20 $ (30 ) $ 94 In July 2012, the Company acquired approximately 3 million shares of Onconova preferred stock for $50 million, which the Company classified as available-for-sale debt securities as a result of certain mandatory redemption rights held by Baxter. In 2013, the Company reclassified the securities to available-for-sale equity securities as a result of the conversion of the preferred stock to common stock upon the completion of Onconovas initial public offering. In 2014, the Company recorded a $45 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write-down the investment in Onconova to its fair value of $9 million based on the duration and severity of the loss. The loss was reported in other expense, net. In 2013, the Company acquired approximately 16 million shares of CTI BioPharma common stock, which are classified as available-for-sale equity securities, for $27 million. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Onconova and CTI BioPharma arrangements. The Company had cumulative unrealized gains for the available-for-sale debt securities of $1 million and less than $1 million as of December 31, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The following table is a reconciliation of the fair value measurements that use significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), which consist of contingent payments related to acquisitions and preferred stock: (in millions) Contingent payments Preferred stock Fair value as of December 31, 2012 $  $ 51 Purchases 269  Net losses recognized in earnings 18  Currency translation adjustments 4  Conversion to a publicly traded equity security  (51 ) Fair value as of December 31, 2013 $ 291 $  Additions 142  Payments (12 )  Net losses recognized in earnings 124  Currency translation adjustments (27 )  Fair value as of December 31, 2014 $ 518 $  The Companys additions in 2014 related to the contingent payment liabilities associated with the acquisitions of Chatham and AesRx. Refer to Note 4 for additional information regarding the contingent payment liabilities. The net loss recognized in earnings and reported in other expense, net primarily related to an increase in the estimated fair value of contingent payment liabilities associated with OBIZUR and related assets from Inspiration/Ipsen. F-21 Table of Contents Book Values and Fair Values of Financial Instruments In addition to the financial instruments that the Company is required to recognize at fair value on the combined balance sheets, the Company has certain financial instruments that are recognized at historical cost or some basis other than fair value. For these financial instruments, the following table provides the values recognized on the combined balance sheets and the approximate fair values: Book values Approximate fair values as of December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Assets Investments $ 31 $ 5 $ 31 $ 5 Liabilities Capital lease obligations $ 276 $ 19 $ 276 $ 19 As of December 31, 2014, the Company recorded $64 million of income in other expense, net related to equity method investments, which primarily represented distributions from funds that sold portfolio companies as well as gains from the sale of certain investments. The fair value of capital lease obligations is based on Level 2 inputs. Investments include certain cost method investments whose fair value is based on Level 3 inputs. NOTE 9 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Collaboration Agreement Contingent Payments Refer to Note 4 for information regarding the Companys unfunded contingent payments associated with collaborative arrangements. Limited Partnership Commitments The Company has unfunded commitments of $32 million as a limited partner in an equity investment as of December 31, 2014. Indemnifications During the normal course of business, the Company enters into indemnities, commitments and guarantees pursuant to which the Company may be required to make payments related to specific transactions. In addition, Baxter indemnifies the Companys directors and officers for certain losses and expenses upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events. The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential for future payments that the Company could be obligated to make. To help address some of these risks, the Company maintains various insurance coverages. Based on historical experience and evaluation of the agreements, the Company does not believe that any significant payments related to its indemnities will occur, and therefore the Company has not recorded any associated liabilities. Lease Commitments The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under capital and operating leases expiring at various dates. The leases generally provide for the Company to pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other operating costs of the leased property. Most of the operating leases contain renewal options. Operating lease rent expense was $42 million in 2014, $40 million in 2013 and $41 million in 2012. F-22 Table of Contents Future Minimum Lease Payments During 2014, the Company entered into a leasing arrangement for a new global innovation and research and development center in Cambridge, Massachusetts and recorded a capital lease obligation of $263 million. The arrangement calls for approximately $170 million in lease payments over an initial term of 12 years and includes two additional five year renewal options. The following table summarizes future minimum lease payments: as of and for the years ended December 31 (in millions) Operating leases Capital leases 2015 $ 43 $ 1 2016 38 7 2017 34 7 2018 26 7 2019 19 7 Thereafter 58 247 Total obligations and commitments 218 276 Interest on capital leases  94 Total lease obligations $ 218 $ 370 NOTE 10 SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Baxter maintains an incentive stock program for the benefit of its officers, directors, and certain employees, including certain Company employees. As the Company receives employee services in consideration for the participation of the Companys employees in these plans, a share-based payment expense for the awards granted to the Companys employees has been reflected in the combined statements of income. The Companys employees participate in Baxter International Inc.s 2001 Incentive Compensation Program, 2003 Incentive Compensation Program, 2007 Incentive Plan, 2011 Incentive Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Baxters share-based compensation generally includes stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance share units (PSUs) and purchases under Baxters employee stock purchase plan. The Companys share-based compensation has been derived from the equity awards granted by Baxter to the Companys employees. As the share-based compensation plans are Baxters plans, the amounts have been recognized through net parent company investment on the combined balance sheets. Share-Based Compensation Expense Share-based compensation expense relating to the Companys employees was $31 million, $26 million and $20 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The related tax benefit recognized was $10 million in 2014, $9 million in 2013 and $7 million in 2012. Approximately 50% of share-based compensation expense from continuing operations was classified in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2014, 2013 and 2012. In 2014, approximately 25% was classified in each of cost of sales and R&D expenses. In 2013 and 2012, approximately 30% was classified in cost of sales and approximately 20% was classified in R&D expenses. Stock Options Stock options are granted with exercise prices at least equal to 100% of the market value on the date of grant. Stock options granted to Company employees generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period. F-23 Table of Contents Stock options typically have a contractual term of 10 years. The grant-date fair value, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the substantive vesting period. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted during each year with respect to the Company employees, along with the weighted-average grant-date fair values, were as follows: years ended December 31 2014 2013 2012 Expected volatility 23 % 25 % 25 % Expected life (in years) 5.5 5.5 5.5 Risk-free interest rate 1.7 % 0.9 % 1.0 % Dividend yield 2.8 % 2.6 % 2.3 % Fair value per stock option $ 11 $ 12 $ 10 The expected volatility assumption is based on a weighted-average of the historical volatility of Baxters stock and the implied volatility from traded options on Baxters stock, with historical volatility more heavily weighted. The expected life assumption is primarily based on the vesting terms of the stock option, historical employee exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate for the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield reflects historical experience as well as future expectations over the expected life of the option. The following table summarizes stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 and stock option information at December 31, 2014 for Company employees: (options and aggregate intrinsic values in thousands) Options Weighted- average exercise price Weighted- average remaining contractual term (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value Outstanding at December 31, 2013 5,473 $ 57.37 Granted 1,523 69.45 Exercised (1,201 ) 52.42 Forfeited (152 ) 68.15 Transferred 444 59.57 Expired (33 ) 52.99 Outstanding at December 31, 2014 6,054 $ 61.31 6.5 $ 72,595 Vested or expected to vest as of December 31, 2014 5,925 $ 61.12 6.4 $ 72,125 Exercisable at December 31, 2014 3,387 $ 55.93 4.8 $ 58,777 The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the difference between the exercise price and Baxters closing stock price on the last trading day of 2014. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $25 million, $25 million and $22 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, $15 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years. RSUs RSUs granted to Company employees generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period. The grant-date fair value, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the substantive vesting period. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of Baxters common stock on the date of grant. F-24 Table of Contents The following table summarizes nonvested RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 for Company employees: (share units in thousands) Share units Weighted- average grant- date fair value Nonvested RSUs at December 31, 2013 464 $ 63.41 Granted 367 70.89 Vested (189 ) 60.96 Transferred 39 67.76 Forfeited (32 ) 67.62 Nonvested RSUs at December 31, 2014 649 $ 68.40 As of December 31, 2014, $23 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $70.89, $70.19 and $58.36, respectively. The fair value of RSUs vested in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $14 million, $9 million and $3 million, respectively. PSUs Baxters stock compensation program for senior management includes the issuance of PSUs based on return on invested capital (ROIC) as well as market conditions. The vesting condition for ROIC PSUs is set at the beginning of each year for each tranche of the award during the three-year service period. Compensation cost for the ROIC PSUs is measured based on the fair value of the awards on the date that the specific vesting terms for each tranche of the award are established. The fair value of the awards is determined based on the quoted price of the Companys stock on the grant date for each tranche of the award. The compensation cost for these PSUs is adjusted at each reporting date to reflect the estimated probability of achieving the vesting condition. The fair value of PSUs based on market conditions is determined using a Monte Carlo model. A Monte Carlo model uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the resulting fair value of the award. The assumptions used in estimating the fair value of these PSUs granted during the period, along with the grant-date fair values, were as follows: years ended December 31 2014 2013 2012 Baxter volatility 20% 21% 24% Peer group volatility 13%-58% 13%-38% 14%-50% Correlation of returns 0.23-0.66 0.37-0.62 0.26-0.54 Risk-free interest rate 0.7% 0.3% 0.4% Fair value per PSU $ 57 $ 67 $ 72 Unrecognized compensation cost related to granted unvested PSUs of $2 million at December 31, 2014 is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. F-25 Table of Contents The following table summarizes nonvested PSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 for Company employees: (share units in thousands) Share units Weighted- average grant-date fair value Nonvested PSUs at January 1, 2013 42 $ 70.03 Granted 24 61.81 Vested (24 ) 71.51 Transferred 5 65.27 Forfeited   Nonvested PSUs at December 31, 2014 47 $ 64.54 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Nearly all Baxter employees, including the Companys employees, are eligible to participate in Baxters employee stock purchase plan. The employee purchase price is 85% of the closing market price on the purchase date. In 2011, shareholders approved the Baxter International Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan which reflected the merger of the previous plans for U.S. and international employees. This employee stock purchase plan provides for 10 million shares of common stock available for issuance to eligible participants. Baxter issued approximately 0.3 million shares in 2014, 0.2 million shares in 2013 and 0.2 million in 2012 under the prior and current employee stock purchase plans to the Companys employees. The number of shares under subscription with respect to the Companys employees at December 31, 2014 totaled approximately 0.2 million. NOTE 11 RETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFIT PROGRAMS Shared Baxter Plans The Companys employees participate in defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sponsored by Baxter, which include participants of Baxters other businesses. Such plans are accounted for as multiemployer plans in these combined financial statements and as a result, no asset or liability was recorded by the Company to recognize the funded status of these plans. The Company recorded expense of $37 million, $45 million, and $36 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, relating to the Companys employees participation in Baxter sponsored plans. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no required contributions outstanding. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, such multiemployer defined benefit pension plans were approximately 62% and 69% funded, respectively. Baxter made total aggregated contributions of $92 million, $83 million and $95 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The most significant shared defined benefit plan is the U.S. Qualified plan. The Companys employees represent approximately 40% of total participants in the U.S. Qualified plan. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the U.S. Qualified plan was approximately 77% and 87% funded, respectively. Baxter did not make any contributions to the U.S. Qualified plan in 2014, 2013, or 2012. Baxter has no obligation to fund the U.S. Qualified plan in 2015. F-26 Table of Contents Austrian Pension Plan The Company is the sole sponsor for certain Austrian defined benefit pension plans. Information for these defined benefit plans are as follows: as of and for the years ended December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 Change in benefit obligation: Projected benefit obligation, beginning of period $ 156 $ 146 Service cost 6 6 Interest cost 5 5 Actuarial loss/(gain) 33 (3 ) Benefit payments (5 ) (5 ) Settlements (3 ) (2 ) Foreign exchange and other (26 ) 9 Projected benefit obligation, end of period $ 166 $ 156 Change in plan assets: Employer contributions $ 8 $ 7 Settlements (3 ) (2 ) Benefits paid (5 ) (5 ) Fair value of plan assets, end of year   Under funded status of the plans $ (166 ) $ (156 ) Amounts recognized in the combined balance sheets: Current liability $ (5 ) $ (6 ) Noncurrent liability (161 ) (150 ) Net liability recognized at December 31 $ (166 ) $ (156 ) for the years ended December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 Net periodic benefit cost: Service cost $ 6 $ 6 $ 4 Interest cost 5 5 5 Amortization of actuarial loss 3 4 1 Settlement charge 1 1  Total net periodic benefit cost $ 15 $ 16 $ 10 Net periodic benefit cost in the table above includes net periodic benefit costs from discontinued operations of $1 million, $2 million and $1 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for the Austrian defined benefit plan was $133 million and $125 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligations exceeded plan assets at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. Other comprehensive loss, net of tax for the Austrian defined benefit plan was $1 million, $7 million, and $27 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which solely consisted of net actuarial losses. The weighted average assumptions used to determine the net cost and benefit obligations for the Austrian defined benefit plan are as follows: 2014 2013 2012 Discount rate 2.00 % 3.30 % 3.25 % Rate of compensation increase 3.50 % 3.50 % 3.50 % F-27 Table of Contents Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants are as follows: (in millions) Pension benefits 2015 $ 5 2016 5 2017 6 2018 7 2019 7 2020 through 2024 45 Total expected net benefit payments for next 10 years $ 75 U.S. Defined Contribution Plan Most of the Companys U.S. employees are eligible to participate in Baxters qualified defined contribution plan. The Company recorded expense of $20 million in 2014, $16 million in 2013 and $13 million in 2012 related to this plan. NOTE 12 ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity that do not arise from transactions with the Parent and consists of net income, foreign currency translation, pension and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and other. The following is a net-of-tax summary of the changes in AOCI by component for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.

(b) These AOCI components are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost disclosed in Note 11. NOTE 13 INCOME TAXES In the Companys combined financial statements, income tax expense and deferred tax balances have been calculated on a separate tax return basis although the Companys operations have historically been included in the tax returns filed by the respective Baxter entities of which the Companys business is a part. In the future, as a standalone entity, the Company will file tax returns on its own behalf and its deferred taxes and effective tax rate may differ from those in the historical periods. The Company maintains an income taxes payable to/from account with Baxter. The Company is deemed to settle current tax balances with the Baxter tax paying entities in the respective jurisdictions. The Companys current income tax balances are reflected as income taxes payable and settlements, which are deemed to occur in the year following incurrence, are reflected as changes in net parent company investment in the combined balance sheets. Income Before Income Tax Expense by Category years ended December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 United States $ 728 $ 881 $ 710 International 804 732 851 Income before income taxes $ 1,532 $ 1,613 $ 1,561 F-29 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense years ended December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 Current United States $ 273 $ 326 $ 267 International 5 42 67 Current income tax expense 278 368 334 Deferred United States 27 (40 ) 23 International 41 (3 ) (1 ) Deferred income tax expense (benefit) 68 (43 ) 22 Income tax expense $ 346 $ 325 $ 356 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 Deferred tax assets Accrued expenses $ 245 $ 295 Retirement benefits 45 40 Tax credits and net operating losses 3 2 Total deferred tax assets 293 337 Deferred tax liabilities Subsidiaries unremitted earnings (34 ) (53 ) Asset basis differences (288 ) (284 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (322 ) (337 ) Net deferred tax liability $ (29 ) $  At December 31, 2014, the Company had foreign operating loss carryforwards totaling $3 million, and no foreign tax credit carryforwards. Realization of the foreign operating loss carryforwards depends on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. No valuation allowances were recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets associated with the net operating loss carryforwards because the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will be fully realized prior to expiration. The Company will continue to evaluate the need for valuation allowances and, as circumstances change, the valuation allowance may change. Income Tax Expense Reconciliation years ended December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 Income tax expense at U.S. statutory rate $ 536 $ 565 $ 546 Tax incentives (111 ) (146 ) (132 ) State and local taxes 26 31 26 Foreign taxes less than U.S. Rate (98 ) (89 ) (94 ) Branded Prescription Drug Fee 20 7 6 Permanent Items 8 (3 ) (5 ) Credits (7 ) (10 ) (7 ) Uncertain tax position (UTP) (19 ) (30 ) 12 Other (9 )  4 Income tax expense $ 346 $ 325 $ 356 F-30 Table of Contents Management intends to continue to reinvest previous earnings in several jurisdictions outside of the United States indefinitely, and therefore has not recorded a U.S. income tax liability related these earnings. As of December 31, 2014 the Company had unremitted earnings of approximately $1.3 billion. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the United States, the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. It is not practicable to determine the net tax effects of a repatriation of these earnings. Unrecognized Tax Benefits The Company classifies interest and penalties associated with income taxes in the income tax expense line in the combined statements of income. Net interest and penalties (payments) expense recorded during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were ($14) million, $2 million and $6 million, respectively. The liability recorded at December 31, 2014 and 2013 related to interest and penalties was $34 million and $47 million, respectively. The following is a reconciliation of the Companys unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. as of and for the years ended (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 Balance at beginning of the year $ 81 $ 259 $ 253 Increase associated with tax positions taken during the current year 2 7 3 Increase associated with tax positions taken during a prior year (4 )  3 Settlements (6 ) (179 )  Decrease associated with lapses in statutes of limitations (8 ) (6 )  Balance at end of the year $ 65 $ 81 $ 259 Of the gross unrecognized tax benefits, $99 million and $129 million were recognized as liabilities in the combined balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. None of the positions included in the liability for uncertain tax positions related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Tax Incentives The Company has received tax incentives in Switzerland, and certain other taxing jurisdictions outside the United States. The financial impact of the reductions as compared to the statutory tax rates is indicated in the income tax expense reconciliation table above. Examination of Tax Returns As of December 31, 2014, the Company had on-going audits in the United States, Switzerland, Austria and Italy. While the final outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain, the Company believes that it has made adequate provisions for all years subject to examination. NOTE 14 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company, as a part of Baxter, is involved in product liability, patent, commercial, and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of the Companys business. The Company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no liability is recorded. As of December 31, 2014, the Companys total recorded reserves with respect to legal matters were $24 million. F-31 Table of Contents The Company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for certain contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved. While the liability of the Company in connection with the claims cannot be estimated and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations and cash flows for that period, the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys combined financial position. While the Company believes that it has valid defenses in these matters, litigation is inherently uncertain, excessive verdicts do occur, and the Company may incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims. The Company remains subject to the risk of future administrative and legal actions. With respect to governmental and regulatory matters, these actions may lead to product recalls, injunctions, and other restrictions on the Companys operations and monetary sanctions, including significant civil or criminal penalties. With respect to intellectual property, the Company may be exposed to significant litigation concerning the scope of the Companys and others rights. Such litigation could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. General Litigation The Company was a defendant, along with others, in a number of lawsuits combined for pretrial proceedings in the U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the Company and certain of its competitors conspired to restrict output and artificially increase the price of plasma-derived therapies since 2003. The Company settled with the direct purchaser plaintiffs for $64 million, which was paid during the first quarter of 2014.

NOTE 16 RELATED PARTIES The Company has not historically operated as a standalone business and has various relationships with Baxter whereby Baxter provides services to the Company. Corporate Overhead and Other Allocations from Baxter Baxter provides the Company certain services, which include, but are not limited to, executive oversight, treasury, finance, legal, human resources, tax planning, internal audit, financial reporting, information technology and investor relations. The financial information in these combined financial statements does not necessarily include all the expenses that would have been incurred had the Company been a separate, standalone entity. Baxter charges the Company for these services based on direct and indirect costs. When specific identification is not practicable, a proportional cost method is used, primarily based on sales, headcount, or square footage. These allocations were reflected as follows in the combined financial statements: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 Cost of sales allocations $ 12 $ 37 $ 28 Selling, general and administrative allocations 511 540 552 Research and development allocations 14 15 14 Other expense, net allocations 1 4  Total corporate overhead and other allocations from Baxter $ 538 $ 596 $ 594 The financial information herein may not necessarily reflect the combined financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in the future or what they would have been had the Company been a separate, standalone entity during the periods presented. Management believes that the methods used to allocate expenses to the Company are reasonable. Share-based Compensation As discussed in Note 10, the Companys employees participate in Baxter share-based compensation plans, the costs of which have been allocated to the Company and recorded in cost of sales, selling and administrative F-33 Table of Contents expenses, and R&D expenses in the combined statements of income. Share-based compensation costs related to the Companys employees were $31 million, $26 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Retirement Plans As discussed in Note 11, the Companys employees participate in defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sponsored by Baxter, the costs of which have been recorded in cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and R&D expenses in the combined statement of income. The costs of such plans related to the Companys employees were $37 million, $45 million and $36 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Centralized Cash Management Baxter uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing of operations. The majority of the Companys subsidiaries are party to Baxters cash pooling arrangements with several financial institutions to maximize the availability of cash for general operating and investing purposes. Under these cash pooling arrangements, cash balances are swept regularly from the Companys accounts. Cash transfers to and from Baxters cash concentration accounts and the resulting balances at the end of each reporting period are reflected in net parent company investment in the combined balance sheets. Debt Baxters third-party debt and the related interest expense have not been allocated to the Company for any of the periods presented as the Company was not the legal obligor of the debt and Baxter borrowings were not directly attributable to the Companys business. NOTE 17 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In July 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with Pfizer Inc. to sell its commercial vaccines business, including NeisVac-C, a vaccine which helps protect against meningitis caused by group C meningococcal meningitis, and FSME-IMMUN, which helps protect against tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), an infection of the brain transmitted by the bite of ticks infected with the TBE-virus, and committed to a plan to divest the remainder of its vaccines business, which includes certain R&D programs. The Company completed the divestiture of the commercial vaccines business in December 2014 and received cash proceeds of $639 million and recorded an after-tax gain of $417 million. The Company entered into a separate agreement with Nanotherapeutics, Inc. for the sale of the remainder of the vaccines business in December 2014, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2015. As a result of the divestitures, the operations and cash flows of the vaccines business have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the Company.

SuppreMol Acquisition In March 2015, the Company acquired SuppreMol GmbH (SuppreMol), a privately held biopharmaceutical company based in Germany, for approximately $225 million. Through the acquisition, the Company has acquired SuppreMols early-stage pipeline of treatment options for autoimmune and allergic diseases and its operations in Munich, Germany. The acquired investigational treatments will complement and build upon the Companys immunology portfolio and offer an opportunity to expand into new areas with significant market potential and unmet medical needs in autoimmune diseases. The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination in the first quarter of 2015. The initial accounting for the transaction is incomplete, pending completion of valuations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

F-40 Table of Contents THE BIOPHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS OF BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) NOTE 1 BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF PREPARATION Background On March 27, 2014, Baxter International Inc. (Baxter or the Parent) announced its plan to create two separate, independent public companies with one focused on developing and marketing biopharmaceuticals and the other on diversified medical products. Under the separation plan, Baxter will spin off its biopharmaceuticals business into Baxalta Incorporated (Baxalta), a wholly owned subsidiary of Baxter that was incorporated on September 8, 2014. The combined biopharmaceuticals business of Baxter is referred to throughout these combined financial statements as the Company. To accomplish the separation, Baxter intends to make a pro rata distribution of more than 80% of Baxaltas common stock to Baxters shareholders. At the time of the distribution, Baxalta will hold the assets and liabilities associated with Baxters biopharmaceuticals business. The distribution is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of a favorable opinion or ruling with respect to the tax-free nature of the distribution and approval by the Baxter Board of Directors. Basis of Preparation The accompanying condensed combined interim financial statements have been prepared on a standalone basis and are derived from Baxters consolidated financial statements and accounting records. The unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements reflect the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows as the business was operated as part of Baxter prior to the distribution, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). These unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements include the attribution of certain assets and liabilities that have historically been held at the Baxter corporate level but which are specifically identifiable or attributable to the Company. All intercompany transactions and accounts within the Company have been eliminated. All transactions between the Company and Baxter are considered to be effectively settled in the unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements at the time the transaction is recorded. The total net effect of the settlement of these intercompany transactions is reflected in the condensed combined statements of cash flows as a financing activity and in the condensed combined balance sheets as net parent company investment. These unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements include an allocation of expenses related to certain Baxter corporate functions, including executive oversight, treasury, finance, legal, human resources, tax planning, internal audit, financial reporting, information technology and investor relations. These expenses have been allocated to the Company based on direct usage or benefit where specifically identifiable, with the remainder allocated primarily on a pro rata basis of revenue, headcount, square footage, or other measures. The Company considers the expense methodology and results to be reasonable for all periods presented. However, the allocations may not be indicative of the actual expense that would have been incurred had the Company operated as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented. Baxter maintains various benefit and share-based compensation plans at a corporate level and other benefit plans at a country level. The Companys employees participate in such programs and a portion of the cost of those plans is included in the Companys financial statements. However, the condensed combined balance sheets do not include any equity related to share-based compensation plans or any net benefit plan obligations unless the benefit plan covers only active and inactive employees of the Company. F-41 Table of Contents The Companys equity balance in these unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements represents the excess of total assets over total liabilities, including the due to/from balances between the Company and Baxter (net parent company investment) and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). Net parent company investment is primarily impacted by contributions from Baxter which are the result of treasury activities and net funding provided by or distributed to Baxter. The unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 has been derived from the audited combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. These unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the combined financial statements and notes for the three years ended December 31, 2014, included elsewhere in this Prospectus. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed interim combined financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim periods. All such adjustments, unless otherwise noted herein, are of a normal, recurring nature. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year. Changes in Accounting Standards In April 2014, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity (ASU 2014-08) which amends the definition of a discontinued operation in Accounting Standard Codifications (ASC) 205-20 and provides additional requirements for the entities with its disposal transaction to qualify as a discontinued operation. ASU 2014-08 is effective prospectively for all disposals beginning on or after December 15, 2014 (with early adoption permitted). The Company did not early adopt the new guidance and it is effective for the Company for periods beginning with its first interim period ending March 31, 2015. ASU 2014-08 did not have a material impact on the condensed combined interim financial statements upon adoption. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. ASU No. 2014-09 will be effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. In April 2015, the FASB issued an exposure draft that would delay the effective date of the standard by one year and allow early adoption as of the original effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on its condensed combined interim financial statements.

Through the acquisition, the Company has acquired SuppreMols early-stage pipeline of treatment options for autoimmune and allergic diseases, as well as its operations in Munich, Germany. The acquired investigational treatments will complement and build upon the Companys immunology portfolio and offer an opportunity to expand into new areas with significant market potential and unmet medical needs in autoimmune diseases. The following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration transferred and the recognized amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date: (in millions) Consideration transferred Cash, net of cash acquired $ 228 Fair value of consideration transferred $ 228 Assets acquired and liabilities assumed Other intangible assets $ 179 Other assets (including deferred tax assets of $17) 19 Long-term liabilities (including deferred tax liabilities of $52) (53 ) Total identifiable net assets 145 Goodwill 83 Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 228 F-43 Table of Contents While the valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is substantially complete, measurement period adjustments may be recorded in the future as the Company finalizes its fair value estimates. Pro forma financial information has not been included because the pro forma impact of the acquisition was not material to the Companys condensed combined financial statements. The Company allocated $179 million of the total consideration to acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D), which is being accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. The acquired IPR&D primarily relates to SuppreMols lead candidate SM-101, an investigational immunoregulatory treatment, which had completed Phase IIa studies at the time of the acquisition and is expected to be completed in approximately 5 years. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections adjusted for the inherent technical, regulatory, commercial and obsolescence risks in such activities, discounted at a rate of 20%. Additional research and development (R&D) will be required prior to regulatory approval, and as of the acquisition date, incremental R&D costs were projected to be in excess of $400 million. The goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes, includes the value of potential future technologies as well as the overall strategic benefits of the acquisition to the Company. Unfunded Contingent Payments At March 31, 2015, the Companys unfunded contingent milestone payments associated with all of its collaborative arrangements totaled $2.2 billion. This total excludes contingent royalty and profit-sharing payments. Based on the Companys projections, any contingent payments made in the future will be more than offset by the estimated net future cash flows relating to the rights acquired for those payments. Milestone Payments to Collaboration Partners The Company did not make any milestone payments to collaboration partners during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Milestone payments to collaboration partners classified as R&D expenses were $25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014. NOTE 4 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill The following is a summary of the activity in goodwill: (in millions) December 31, 2014 $ 565 Additions 83 Currency translation adjustment (CTA) (19 ) March 31, 2015 $ 629 The addition in the three months ended March 31, 2015 relates to the acquisition of SuppreMol. See Note 3 for further information. As of March 31, 2015, there were no accumulated goodwill impairment losses. F-44 Table of Contents Other intangible assets, net The following is a summary of the Companys other intangible assets: (in millions) Developed technology, including patents Other amortized intangible assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets Total March 31, 2015 Gross other intangible assets $ 420 $ 28 $ 313 $ 761 Accumulated amortization (133 ) (26 )  (159 ) Other intangible assets, net $ 287 $ 2 $ 313 $ 602 December 31, 2014 Gross other intangible assets $ 440 $ 29 $ 149 $ 618 Accumulated amortization (133 ) (26 )  (159 ) Other intangible assets, net $ 307 $ 3 $ 149 $ 459 Intangible asset amortization expense was $8 million and $4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of March 31, 2015 is $27 million in 2015, $26 million in 2016, $24 million in 2017, $23 million in 2018, $19 million in 2019 and $19 million in 2020. The increase in other intangible assets, net from the IPR&D acquired in the acquisition of SuppreMol during the first quarter of 2015 was partially offset by amortization expense and CTA. NOTE 5 BUSINESS OPTIMIZATION CHARGES The Company has historically participated in business optimization plans initiated by Baxter. The Companys total charges (benefits) related to these plans are presented below: Three months ended March 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 Cash expenses $  $ 16 Reserve adjustments (10 )  Total business optimization expenses (10 ) 16 Discontinued operations  (8 ) Business optimization (benefits) expenses in continuing operations $ (10 ) $ 8 For the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company adjusted its previously estimated business optimization charges due to changes in assumptions resulting in a $10 million benefit recorded during the period. For the three months ended March 31, 2014, business optimization charges primarily related to the Companys costs associated with optimizing the overall cost structure on a global basis, as Baxter rationalized its manufacturing facilities and re-aligned certain R&D activities. The charges during the three months ended March 31, 2014 consisted of $2 million in cost of sales and $6 million in R&D expenses (with an additional $8 million recorded in discontinued operations). F-45 Table of Contents The following table summarizes cash activity in the reserves related to business optimization initiatives: (in millions) Reserves as of December 31, 2014 $ 60 Charges  Reserve adjustments (10 ) Utilization (4 ) Reserves as of March 31, 2015 $ 46 The reserves are expected to be substantially utilized by the end of 2016. Management believes that these reserves are adequate. However, adjustments may be recorded in the future as the programs are completed. NOTE 6 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITY Interest Rate Risk Management The Company is exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in benchmark interest rates relating to its anticipated issuances of debt in connection with the separation. The Companys policy is to manage this risk to an acceptable level. Cash Flow Hedges In December 2014 and during the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge the risk to earnings associated with movements in benchmark interest rates relating to the anticipated issuance of debt in connection with the separation. For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is accumulated in AOCI and then recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the combined balance sheets and are classified as short-term or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. The following table presents the gross notional amount and estimated fair value of the Companys derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014: (in millions) Notional amount Derivatives in asset positions Derivatives in liability positions Balance sheet location Fair value Balance sheet location Fair value March 31, 2015 Interest rate contracts $ 1,800 Other current assets $ 1 Accrued liabilities $ 57 December 31, 2014 Interest rate contracts $ 550 Other current assets $ 1 Accrued liabilities $ 2 The Company recorded a loss of $55 million in other comprehensive income during the three months ended March 31, 2015. There was no ineffectiveness during the three months ended March 31, 2015. In certain instances, the Company may discontinue cash flow hedge accounting because the forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring. As of March 31, 2015, all forecasted transactions are probable of occurring and no gains or losses were reclassified into earnings. F-46 Table of Contents As of March 31, 2015, $1 million of deferred, net after-tax losses on derivative instruments included in AOCI are expected to be recognized in earnings during the next 12 months, coinciding with when the hedged items are expected to impact earnings. Refer to Note 8 for the balance in AOCI associated with cash flow hedges. NOTE 7 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company engages in business with foreign governments in certain countries that have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions, including Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy. As of March 31, 2015, the Companys net accounts receivable from the public sector in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled $79 million. Global economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses. Governmental actions and customer-specific factors may also require the Company to re-evaluate the collectability of its receivables and the Company could potentially incur additional credit losses. These conditions may also impact the stability of the Euro. Fair Value Measurements The fair value hierarchy under the accounting standard for fair value measurements consists of the following three levels:  Level 1Quoted prices in active markets that the Company has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities;  Level 2Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; and  Level 3Valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and include the use of judgment by the Companys management about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. F-47 Table of Contents The following tables summarize the bases used to measure financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the condensed combined balance sheets: Basis of fair value measurement (in millions) Balance as of March 31, 2015 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Assets Available-for-sale securities Equity securities $ 68 $ 68 $  $  Foreign government debt securities 15  15  Interest rate contracts 1  1  Total assets $ 84 $ 68 $ 16 $  Liabilities Contingent payments related to acquisitions $ 496 $  $  $ 496 Interest rate contracts 57  57  Total liabilities $ 553 $  $ 57 $ 496 Basis of fair value measurement (in millions) Balance as of December 31, 2014 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Assets Available-for-sale securities Equity securities $ 71 $ 71 $  $  Foreign government debt securities 18  18  Interest rate contracts 1  1  Total assets $ 90 $ 71 $ 19 $  Liabilities Contingent payments related to acquisitions $ 518 $  $  $ 518 Interest rate contracts 2  2  Total liabilities $ 520 $  $ 2 $ 518 For assets that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, the fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The fair values of foreign government debt securities are obtained from pricing services or broker/dealers who use proprietary pricing applications, which include observable market information for like or same securities. Contingent payments related to acquisitions consist of development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, in addition to sales-based payments, and are valued using discounted cash flow techniques. The fair value of development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments reflects managements expectations of probability of payment, and increases or decreases as the probability of payment or expectation of timing of payments changes. As of March 31, 2015, managements expected weighted-average probability of payment for development and commercial milestone payments was approximately 24%, with individual probabilities ranging from 10%-95%. The fair value of sales-based payments is based upon probability-weighted future revenue estimates, and increases as revenue estimates increase, probability weighting of higher revenue scenarios increase or expectation of timing of payment is accelerated. F-48 Table of Contents The following table provides information relating to the Companys investments in available-for-sale equity securities: (in millions) Amortized cost Unrealized gains Unrealized (losses) Fair value March 31, 2015 Available-for-sale equity securities $ 43 $ 26 $ (1 ) $ 68 December 31, 2014 Available-for-sale equity securities $ 59 $ 21 $ (9 ) $ 71 The Company recorded $9 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges based on the duration of losses related to two of the Companys investments during the three months ended March 31, 2015. The Company had cumulative unrealized gains on available-for-sale debt securities of $1 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The following table is a reconciliation of the fair value measurements that use significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), which consists of contingent payments related to acquisitions: (in millions) Contingent payments Fair value as of December 31, 2014 $ 518 CTA (22 ) Fair value as of March 31, 2015 $ 496 Book Values and Fair Values of Financial Instruments In addition to the financial instruments that the Company is required to recognize at fair value on the condensed combined balance sheets, the Company has certain financial instruments that are recognized at historical cost or some basis other than fair value. For these financial instruments, the following table provides the values recognized on the condensed combined balance sheets and the approximate fair values: Book values Approximate fair values (in millions) March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Assets Investments $ 38 $ 31 $ 38 $ 31 Liabilities Capital lease obligations $ 318 $ 276 $ 318 $ 276 The fair value of capital lease obligations is based on Level 2 inputs. Investments include certain cost method investments whose fair value is based on Level 3 inputs. In connection with the Companys initiative to invest in early-stage products and therapies, the Company increased its unfunded commitments as a limited partner in multiple investment companies to $80 million as of March 31, 2015 from $32 million as of December 31, 2014. In the three months ended March 31, 2014, the Company recorded $25 million of income in other (expense) income, net related to equity method investments, which primarily represented gains from the sale of certain investments. F-49 Table of Contents NOTE 8 ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity that do not arise from transactions with the Parent and consists of net income, foreign currency translation, pension, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and hedging activities.

NOTE 9 INCOME TAXES Effective Tax Rate The Companys effective income tax rate was 22.7% and 24.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Companys effective income tax rate differs from the United States federal statutory rate each year due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives, state and local taxes, and foreign taxes that are different than the U. S. federal statutory rate. In addition, the effective tax rate can be impacted each period by discrete factors and events. The effective tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2015 was favorably impacted by separation costs incurred during the period that were deductible at tax rates higher than the effective tax rate and the resolution of miscellaneous tax contingent liabilities. The effective tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2014 was negatively impacted by R&D charges associated with milestone payments made to collaboration partners that were deductible at tax rates lower than the effective tax rate. NOTE 10 SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Share-based compensation expense totaled $10 million and $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, approximately 60% of share-based compensation expense from continuing operations was classified in selling, general and administrative expenses, approximately 25% was classified in cost of sales, and approximately 15% was classified in R&D expenses. During the three months ended March 31, 2014, approximately 50% was classified in selling, general and administrative expenses, approximately 30% was classified in cost of sales, and approximately 20% was classified in R&D expenses. F-51 Table of Contents During the three months ended March 31, 2015, Baxter awarded annual stock compensation grants consisting of 2.2 million stock options and 329,000 Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), with respect to the Companys employees. Stock Options The weighted-average Black-Scholes assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted during the period, along with the weighted-average grant-date fair values, were as follows: Three months ended March 31, 2015 2014 Expected volatility 20 % 24 % Expected life (in years) 5.5 5.5 Risk-free interest rate 1.7 % 1.7 % Dividend yield 3.0 % 2.8 % Fair value per stock option $ 9 $ 12 The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $4 million and $11 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of March 31, 2015, the unrecognized compensation cost related to all unvested stock options of $30 million is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years. RSUs As of March 31, 2015, the unrecognized compensation cost related to all unvested RSUs of $39 million is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. Performance Share Units (PSUs) As of March 31, 2015, the unrecognized compensation cost related to all granted unvested PSUs of $2 million is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 1.2 years. NOTE 11 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company, as part of Baxter, is involved in product liability, patent, commercial, and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of the Companys business. The Company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no liability is recorded. As of March 31, 2015, the Companys total recorded reserves with respect to legal matters were $19 million. The Company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for certain contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved. While the liability of the Company in connection with the claims cannot be estimated and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations and cash flows for that period, the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys combined financial position. While the Company believes that it has valid defenses in these matters, litigation is inherently uncertain, excessive verdicts do occur, and the Company may incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims. F-52 Table of Contents The Company remains subject to the risk of future administrative and legal actions. With respect to governmental and regulatory matters, these actions may lead to product recalls, injunctions, and other restrictions on the Companys operations and monetary sanctions, including significant civil or criminal penalties. With respect to intellectual property, the Company may become exposed to significant litigation concerning the scope of the Companys and others rights. Such litigation could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. NOTE 12 RELATED PARTIES The Company has not historically operated as a standalone business and has various relationships with Baxter whereby Baxter provides services to the Company. Corporate Overhead and Other Allocations from Baxter Baxter provides the Company certain services, which include, but are not limited to, executive oversight, treasury, finance, legal, human resources, tax planning, internal audit, financial reporting, information technology and investor relations. The financial information in these unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements does not necessarily include all the expenses that would have been incurred had the Company been a separate, standalone entity. Baxter charges the Company for these services based on direct and indirect costs. When specific identification is not practicable, a proportional cost method is used, primarily based on sales, headcount, or square footage. These allocations were reflected as follows in the unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements: Three months ended March 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 Cost of sales allocations $ 9 $ 5 Selling, general and administrative allocations 122 122 Research and development allocations 1 3 Total corporate overhead and other allocations from Baxter $ 132 $ 130 The financial information herein may not necessarily reflect the condensed combined financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in the future or what they would have been had the Company been a separate, standalone entity during the periods presented. Management believes that the methods used to allocate expenses to the Company are reasonable. Share-based Compensation The Companys employees participate in Baxter share-based compensation plans, the costs of which have been allocated to the Company and recorded in cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and R&D expenses in the condensed combined statements of income. Share-based compensation costs related to the Companys employees were $10 million and $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Retirement Plans The Companys employees participate in defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sponsored by Baxter, the costs of which have been recorded in cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and R&D expenses in the condensed combined statements of income. The costs of such plans related to the Companys employees were $12 million and $9 million for three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. F-53 Table of Contents Centralized Cash Management Baxter uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing of operations. The majority of the Companys subsidiaries are party to Baxters cash pooling arrangements with several financial institutions to maximize the availability of cash for general operating and investing purposes. Under these cash pooling arrangements, cash balances are swept regularly from the Companys accounts. Cash transfers to and from Baxters cash concentration accounts and the resulting balances at the end of each reporting period are reflected in net parent company investment in the condensed combined balance sheets. Debt Baxters third-party debt and the related interest expense have not been allocated to the Company for any of the periods presented as the Company was not the legal obligor of the debt and Baxter borrowings were not directly attributable to the Companys business. NOTE 13 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In July 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with Pfizer, Inc. to sell its commercial vaccines business and committed to a plan to divest the remainder of its vaccines business, which includes certain R&D programs. In December 2014, the Company completed the divestiture of the commercial vaccines business. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company recorded an after-tax gain of $9 million as a result of a purchase price adjustment. In December 2014, the Company also entered into a separate agreement for the sale of the remainder of the vaccines business. As a result of the divestitures, the operations and cash flows of the vaccines business have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the Company. Following is a summary of the operating results of the vaccines business, which have been reflected as discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014: (in millions) Three months ended March 31, 2015 2014 Net sales $ 1 $ 103 Income from operations before income taxes, excluding gain on sale 1 56 Gain on sale before income taxes 10  Income tax expense (1 ) (7 ) Income from discontinued operations, net of tax $ 10 $ 49 NOTE 14 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluated subsequent events for recognition or disclosure through May 19, 2015, the date the condensed combined interim financial statements were available to be issued. Oncaspar ® Acquisition In May 2015, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Oncaspar ® (pegaspargase) product portfolio from Sigma-Tau Finanziaria S.p.A, a privately held biopharmaceutical company based in Italy, for approximately $900 million before working capital and other transaction adjustments. Through the acquisition, the Company will gain the marketed biologic treatment Oncaspar ® , the investigational biologic calaspargase pegol, and an established oncology infrastructure with clinical and sales resources. Oncaspar ® is a first-line biologic used as part of a chemotherapy regimen to treat patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It is currently marketed in the United States, Germany, Poland and certain other countries and has approximately $100 million in annual sales. The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2015 and be accounted for as a business combination. F-54 Table of Contents PART II INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS ITEM 13. OTHER EXPENSES OF ISSUANCE AND DISTRIBUTION . The following table sets forth the costs and expenses payable by the registrant in connection with the issuance of the securities being registered. All amounts are estimates except the Securities and Exchange Commission registration fee. Item Amount Securities and Exchange Commission registration fee $ 13,086 Legal fees and expenses $ 50,000 Accounting fees and expenses $ 20,000 Printing expenses $ 25,000 Total $ 108,086 ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their shareholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors fiduciary duties as directors, and Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation will include such an exculpation provision. Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws will include provisions that indemnify, to the fullest extent allowable under the DGCL, the personal liability of directors or officers of Baxalta or any of its subsidiaries, and any director, officer or employee of Baxalta serving at Baxaltas request as a director, officer, employee or agent of, or in a fiduciary capacity with respect to, another entity. Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws will also provide that Baxalta must pay and advance the expenses incurred by the indemnified person in defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, subject to its receipt of an undertaking from the indemnified party that such party will repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that such party is not entitled to be indemnified by Baxalta. Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation will expressly authorize Baxalta to carry insurance to protect Baxalta, its directors, officers and employees, and any director, officer or employee of Baxalta serving at Baxaltas request as a director, officer, employee or agent of, or in a fiduciary capacity with respect to, another entity. The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions that will be in Baxaltas amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against Baxaltas directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit Baxalta and its shareholders. However, these provisions will not limit or eliminate Baxaltas rights, or those of any shareholder, to seek non-monetary relief such as injunction or rescission in the event of a breach of a directors duty of care. The provisions will not alter the liability of directors under the federal securities laws. In addition, investments in Baxalta may be adversely affected to the extent that, in a class action or direct suit, the company pays the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions. ITEM 15. RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES. In connection with the formation of Baxalta on September 8, 2014, Baxalta issued 100 shares of its common stock to Baxter pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. Baxalta did not register this issuance of the issued shares under the Securities Act because such issuance did not constitute a public offering. On June 23, 2015, Baxalta issued $5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes pursuant to an exemption under the Securities Act. See Description of Material Indebtedness. II-1 Table of Contents ITEM 16. EXHIBITS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES. (a) Exhibits See Exhibit Index. (b) Financial Statement Schedules None. ITEM 17. UNDERTAKINGS. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. II-2 Table of Contents Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. II-3 Table of Contents SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement on Form S-1 to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Deerfield, State of Illinois, on June 23, 2015.
