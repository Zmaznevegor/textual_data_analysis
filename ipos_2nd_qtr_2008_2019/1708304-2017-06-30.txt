Our shares of common stock are not traded on any national exchange and in accordance with Rule 457(o) the offering price was determined by the price of the shares that were sold to some of our shareholders in a private placement. We intend to apply to have our shares of Common Stock quoted on the OTCBB. The price of $5.00 is a fixed price at which the selling shareholders may sell their shares until our shares of common stock are quoted on the OTCBB marketplace and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices or in transactions that are not in the public market. Before our shares of Common Stock can be quoted on the OTCBB, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) must approve a Form 211 application filed by a licensed market maker. There can be no assurance that: (1) a market maker will agree to file the Form 211 Application; (2) that FINRA will approve the Form 211 Application; or (3) that our application to be quoted on the OTCBB marketplace will be approved. (2) Calculated under Section 6(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 as .00003930 of the aggregate offering price.

The selling shareholders are offering 3,059,500 shares of the Company’s common stock and the Company is offering 267,914 shares of its common stock. The shares may only be offered and sold, from time to time, using this prospectus in transactions at a fixed offering price of $5.00 per share until a trading market develops in our common stock, at which time the selling shareholders may sell shares at prevailing market prices, which may vary, or they may sell shares at privately negotiated prices. The proceeds from the sale of the selling shareholders' shares will go directly to the selling shareholders and will not be available to us, while the proceeds from the sale of shares by the Company will go directly to the Company. The selling shareholders and any broker/dealer executing sell orders on behalf of the selling shareholders are "underwriters" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Currently, no public market exists for our common stock. We will seek to have a market maker publish quotations for our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board ("OTCBB"), which is maintained by the Financial Institutions National Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). However, we have no agreement or understanding with any potential market maker to do so. We cannot assure you that a public market for our common stock will develop.

We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. For more details regarding emerging growth companies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARDLOOKING STATEMENTS The information contained in this prospectus, including in the documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus, includes some statements that are not purely historical and that are “forwardlooking statements.” Such forwardlooking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our Company and management’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future, including our financial condition, results of operations, and the expected impact of the offering on the parties’ individual and combined financial performance. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forwardlooking statements. The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “continue,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plans,” “possible,” “potential,” “predicts,” “projects,” “seeks,” “should,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions, or the negatives of such terms, may identify forwardlooking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forwardlooking. The forward looking statements contained in this prospectus are based on current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and the potential effects on the parties and the transaction. There can be no assurance that future developments actually affecting us will be those anticipated. These forwardlooking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the parties’ control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements. RISK FACTORS Please consider the following risk factors before deciding to invest. This offering and any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all of the information contained in this prospectus before deciding whether or not to purchase our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that our management currently believes may significantly affect us. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed and investors in our common stock could lose part or all of their investment in our shares. RISKS RELATED TO THE NATURE OF OUR SERVICE As a patient website aimed at promoting communication among patients, our success will be dependent upon two factors: 1. The user base (UB) 2. Average user's engagement level (AUEL). The subscription scale (SS), which is expressed as SS= {UB, AUEL...}if we cannot maintain an adequate SS level, we will not be successful. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUFFICIENT USERS/CLIENTS IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS. IF WE CAN’T ATTRACT SUFFICIENT USERS, QUITE SIMPLY OUR BUSINESS GROWTH MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED. Users of our website will be able to stay connected with their family, friends, medical professionals, various products, and social resources. The concept User here refers only to subscribers to this website. Advertisers, medical suppliers and facilities, MD’s, pharmaceutical companies are also users of the site and provide a significant share of our revenue. The User base is aggregate subscribers of our website during a certain period. In general, the monthly active user base (MAUB) is a measure of the success of a website. As a new website, the ability to enroll subscribers must be proven, and the promotion of our website will be one of our singular goals. In theory, the MAUB growth rate is affected by: 8 1. Patient population; 2. Patient’s willingness to share public communication; 3. The convenience of our website; 4. The brand strength of our business; 5. The products we provide or advertisers have; 6. The contents subscribers post; 7. The competition among similar services; 8. The existing social media; 9. Our website promotional investments; and 10. The technical security of our website. The negative result of any one of the above factors can adversely affect our revenue and our potential for success. THE DEVELOPMENT OF USER’S ENGAGEMENT LEVEL IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS. IF WE CANNOT PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY EXPERIENCE TO USERS, OUR BUSINESS MAY NOT GROW. Users can create contents and generate feedback, and the more they do, the better their engagement. User engagement level has a direct relation to the experience they have with a website, and their expectations. Of course, a consumer's expectations and experience is difficult to ascertain in advance. All websites are not successful, and we may not be successful in engaging a sufficient number of users. Theoretically, user engagement level is affected by: 1. The quality and diversification of products and services we provide; 2. Number of Users; 3. Efficient Internet displays of contents that Users present; 4. Fast updates and velocity of contents; 5. The level of communication among clients; and 6. The number of regular customers. The negative result of any of the one above factors will adversely affect our revenues and potential for success. WE ARE SUBJECT TO SEVERE COMPETITION TO ATTRACT ADVERTISING DOLLARS TO OUR WEBSITE Advertisement here refers to advertisers posting their products and services onto our website, which includes but is not limited to online advertising, online marketing for other sites and apps, plus our website platform may deliver promotional messages to Users. As an online advertising site, we face substantial competition, including competition from websites with much more resources than we have. For example, people may use new technologies to block or obscure the display of our website’s ads and contents, which could result in site interruption or site corruption. Enrolling advertisers in an increasingly competitive market is very difficult and we may not be successful in doing so. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR REVENUE WILL COME MOSTLY FROM ADVERTISING. THE LOSS OF ADVERTISERS, OR REDUCTION IN SPENDING BY ADVERTISERS, COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR REVENUE As a patient website which can meet the demands of multiple advertisers, our advertising revenue is mainly dependent on two factors: 1. Advertiser scale or quantity (AS) 2. Average investment per advertisement (AIPA). The advertisement revenue (AR) can be expressed as AR = {AS, AIPA...} If we cannot maintain a satisfactory AR level we will not be successful. 9 THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADVERTISING DOLLARS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS. IF WE CANNOT ATTRACT SUFFICIENT ADVERTISERS, OUR BUSINESS GROWTH MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED Advertising quantity is the aggregate advertisers invest on our website during a certain period. As a new website, we will require a certain timespan to acquire and attract advertisers. In theory, advertiser quantity is affected by the following factors: 1. The macroscopic economic cycle; 2. The economic development of medical and pharmacology business; 3. The quantity of users as subscribers; 4. The experience our website provides to users; 5. Advertising revenue from our website; 6. Our website promotion and marketing; 7. The advertising resource management proficiency of our website, including ad inventory management which affects the number, size, and prominence of ads to be displayed; 8. The competitive strength among companies in the same industry; and 9. The balance between advertising effectiveness (Type, frequency, prominence, and size of ads) and other contents displayed. The negative result of any one of the above noted factors will adversely affect earnings and our potential for success. IF WE CAN'T PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY RETURN TO ADVERTISERS, AND IF WE CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THAT RETURN TO OUR ADVERTISERS OUR REVENUE MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY HARMED Average investment per advertisement is the advertising investment amount per advertiser by average during certain period. Advertisers emphasize w eb traffic, which is the amount of data sent and received by visitors to a web site. As a new site, since we have no traffic statistics, our preliminary advertisers may invest on our website tentatively. That investment may be short-term, for small amounts and irregular. Theoretically, the investment amount per advertiser is affected by the following factors: 1. The expected ROI of advertisers; 2. The macroscopic economic cycle; 3. Advertiser’s economic status and business strategy; 4. Our subscriber quantity; 5. The style, design, products, and services available on our website and related resources; 6. The promotional investment quantity of our website; 7. Our practices and ability to maximize the Website's advertising for value; and 8. The comparative advantages and weakness of our website among services of a similar nature, although our delivery of creativity should make us unique. The negative result of any one of the above will adversely affect our earnings and our potential for success. 10 THERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES OF INTERNET ADVERTISING INCLUDING INTERACTIVE ADVERTISING, E-MAIL ADVERTISING, AND VIRAL MARKETING THAT ARE REGULATED BY MANY STATUTES, PARTICULARLY THOSE ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC). IF THERE ARE VIOLATIONS, OUR ADVERTISEMENT SERVICES COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. The FTC monitors and enforces laws regarding online advertising, and has enforcement or administrative responsibilities under more than 70 statutes. Online advertising issues may be through false advertising, theft of intellectual property rights, privacy, contests and sweepstakes, and much more. FTC has issued “Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising”, which may require those giving testimonials to disclose their relationship with a Company if it benefits them directly. The best references are untouched by the advertisers, and many do this now, including even any and all negative referrals, which encourages potential buyers to trust them. For some of our advertising and promotional events, we may use patient’s names and photos and post them on our website, obviously with permission only. In Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, it defines a commercial electronic mail message as “any electronic mail message, the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service.” (Including content on an Internet website operated for a commercial purpose) More importantly, it clearly points out the legitimate ways to use emails for normal commercial services. If we fail to comply with these requirements we could suffer damages. RISKS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUBSCRIBERS AND MARKETING Investment is important to the development of subscribers. Developing clients is also an art and science, and the most successful websites have learned this. If we are unable to develop a reasonable subscriber base we might not be successful. WEBSITE PROMOTION SKILL IS CRITICAL TO ENROLL SUBSCRIBERS. IF WE CANNOT MOTIVATE VISITORS TO ULTIMATELY SUBSCRIBE, WE WILL FAIL To attract clients and medical professionals to use our website, there are many promotional skills to develop potential subscriber’s interest about our website. Some of the skills are listed below: 1. Integration and compromise between our business target and customer’s demands; 2. An efficient way to communicate with patients and medical professionals in a simple to understand way; 3. Critical editing, and the creation of unique stories, and a forum’s topic and original posts, great contents in all respects, including chat room conversations, etc.; 4. Convenience of graphics for audience and the plan of introducing pictures, info-graphic and graphic stories & contents, favicons, emoticons, and videos; 5. Display pleasing aesthetics through designs for primary and all pages plus graphics and videos, including ads. Appearances count, viewers will always return more to visually pleasing and easy to use sites; 6. The management talents of the content administrator and moderator in dealing with topics, threads, posts, private messages, chat discussions, and stopping any trolling or spamming. 7. Introducing new technologies as they become available to promote communications between the website and potential and existing users; To be a leader in the field by the rational allocation of our resources and continuously learning from competitors; and 8. The ability to design an aesthetically pleasing website. A poor result of any one of the above noted factors will adversely affect our business. 11 THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED MEMBERS IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS. IF WE CAN’T ATTRACT SUFFICIENT ADVANCED MEMBERS, OUR BUSINESS GROWTH MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. The development of unique applications will allow the Company to charge a monthly, quarterly, or annual fee for access to certain advanced applications and content. We anticipate that such advanced memberships will be an important source of revenue. We anticipate that our ability to attract such advanced memberships will be affected by the following factors, among others: 1. The quality of the Patient Daily to be delivered to advanced members; 2. The purchase discount we provide to advanced members; 3. The sophistication and attractiveness of events for advanced members; and 4. The aesthetic design, and the products and services of our website and related resources. If we are unable to attract advanced members our revenue will be adversley affected. WE MAY FACE LOSSES AS A WEBSITE CONTENT PROVIDER The opinion of our users and members about the patient website may change dramatically when they are stimulated by internal and external factors. The patient's opinions on the quality, value or usefulness of our products will vary. This will be a challenge for our service. The web chat room's primary use is to share information via text between a group of people. Some users may post rumors and false information on occasion. An internet forum, blog, or message board, is an online discussion site where users can hold conversations in the form of posted messages. It can also be used for illegal purposes. As a content provider, we are exposed to claims related to defamation, violation of intellectual property rights, and privacy rights. THE COMPANY FACES RISKS RELATED TO THE CONTENT POSTED BY USERS AND OUR EMPLOYEES Third parties may attempt to coerce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to proprietary data or our user's personal data. Some platform developers may store information provided by our users through apps on the company platform or web sites integrated with the Company. If these third parties or platform developers fail to comply with security terms and policies, our user's data may be improperly disclosed and we could face liability for such disclosure. LIABILITY FOR CONTENT NOT COVERED BY THE COMMUNICATION DECENCY ACT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACY OUR BUSINESS. The Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996 protects freedom of expression and innovation on the Internet and says that "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider." Regardless, the Company may still face the following liability related to content service in some situations: 1. Fraudulent information posted by users and our employees; 2. Deceptive advertising; 3. Illegal disclosure of patient's medical records and related information; 4. Intellectual Property infringement issues; and 5. Libel and false claims. The negative impact of any one above items could adversely affect our earnings, and our potential for success. 12 FAILURE TO OBTAIN USEFUL INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE COULD RESULT IN LOSSES Several of our competitor’s high traffic blogs or discussion groups will compete for users with the Company. A blog allows posting of text, images, audio, video, hyperlinks to other web pages and other related material. Readers may post comments in an interactive format. Any “thread” could become popular and see much activity. Our topic may overlap with our competitor’s blogs. We are not certain that our users will be satisfied with the content we present and consider the information useful and relevant to them. If the content is not the type users are looking for, the Company will have to invest more time and effort improving content, costing money and it will decreasing our earnings. WE HAVE INSUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH POTENTIAL THREATS SUCH AS DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, UNAUTHORIZED USE/INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, DEFAMATION, and FALSE ENDORSEMENTS Some content may be very sensitive. We may be exposed to losses related to claims of libel, defamation of character, and breach of privacy. As a form of social media, we may have some content such as employee blogs, disclosure of trade secrets, disclosure of financial information, or information related to children, which could expose us to losses. WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR EXPOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service's HIPAA Privacy Rule requires doctors, nurses, pharmacies, hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care providers to protect the privacy of individual health information. If we allow such information to be disclosed we could face liability. WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR THE ACTION OF HACKERS E-Commerce faces a variety of challenges. The Company’s website will provide an online exhibition of products for sale by users. Users may create a Patient Shopping Mall (P-Mall). Our e-commerce platform may be attacked by hackers, viruses, worms, malware and possibly even company employees. Hacktivists may attack our platform for political cause; computer criminals may hack for profit or financial benefits, and cyberterrorists may damage the infrastructure of our website. Such articles could damage our website and could expose us to legal liability. THE DEVELOPMENT OF E-COMMERCE IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS. IF WE CANNOT DEVELOP PATIENTS' PRODUCTS FOR SALE, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. The E-commerce here refers to the exhibition and sale of users’ creative works, products and intellectual property on our e-commerce platform. Our Company will receive a percentage of the sale price as a commission on the sale of such products. ClickWrap technology will be used to record contracts with sellers. The Terms of Service will be amended as needed to address problems as the occur. The revenue from E-commerce may be affected by the following factors: 1. The value of products exhibited and sold; 2. The quality, diversity, and price of the products offered for sale; 3. The actual sale price; 4. The ease of use of our e-Commerce service; 5. The commission paid by the seller for using our website; 6. The effectiveness of sales and marketing campaigns; 7. Returns and charge backs; 8. Delivery and logistics; and The negative result of any one above factor will adversely affect our earnings and our potential for success. 13 THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL ENTERTAINMENT SERVICE IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS. IF THE SERVICE CAN'T REACH A BREAK-EVEN POINT, OUR BUSINESS GROWTH MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Our website will provide digital entertainment to patients in order to help them cope during difficult times. Content will include films, videos, animation, gaming and music. Content can be displayed on PCs, tablets or mobile devices. Authors may offer free content or may charge based on download. These charges will be a source of revenue to the Company and such revenues may be affected by the following factors: 1. The quality and popularity of the entertainment content provided; 2. The size the Patient Website user base; 3. The total cost to use the entertainment products including rates charge by the Website; and 4. The sales and marketing resources committed to expand the service. Failure to achiever the factors listed above could negatively affect our business and our prospect for success. CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS MAY CREATE CERTAIN RISKS TO THE COMPANY Our services may also be impacted by issues related to money transmission, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, banking and lending. These electronic transfers could put the Company at risk of violations for charge backs as well as other legal violations such as money laundering, terrorist financing and gambling. Charge backs and customer disputes may increase our costs and divert our management time with negotiation and/or arbitration. It is possible that illegal activities by users, developers, employees or third parties and these could create liabilities for the Company. DIGITAL ENTERTAINMENT HAS ARTISTIC COPYRIGHTS. IF THERE IS VIOLATION OF COPYRIGHTS, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Copyright issues for film, television, animation, game and music are litigated frequently in the U.S. and the world. The digital entertainment services we provide could create risks associated with the following: 1. IP for written and artistic expression; 2. Patents for tangible items; and 3. Trademarks for brands and logos. There are so many regulations governing digital entertainment such as USPTO and Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, The Copyright Act of 1976, Rules of Practice in Trademark Cases; the Trademark Act of 1946, and Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016. Copyrights created after January 1, 1978 have protection during the life of the author plus 70 years, and the Work-Made-For-Hire rule has 95 years term and 120 years term. While "fair use" allows limited use of a copyrighted works for those purposes such as teaching, criticism, reviews, news reporting, and research, sometimes only a court can decide what kind of use is "fair use". If we violate such laws or if we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, the Company may be liable for economic compensation or other penalties. SPECIAL EVENT MANAGEMENT IS IMPORTANT TO OUR SUCCESS. IF THE PLANNING, LIVE STREAMING, ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Special events are one of the most powerful keys to penetrate a target market and build the Website's brand. It functions to increase both subscriber sales, and advertiser revenues that generate cash flow. A clever Special Events marketing strategy will help the Website to increase sustainability. Factors related to special events management include: 14 1. A well-prepared events strategy, and both short-term and long-term plans; 2. A professional team to manage events efficiently; 3. Substantial sales and marketing budget; 4. Professional events promotion to maximize value; 5. Multiple media market advertising of events; and 6. Reliable technical support; Failure to accomplish the factors noted above will adversely affect our revenues and our potential for success. Failure to attract users to our events could degrade our revenues and revenue growth. RISKS RELATED TO TECHNIQUE AND PLATFORM The patient website will operate in an open environment. The physical server is provided by a hosting company. The subscribers will come from around the world and have diversified knowledge and skills. Today, network security remains a concern. We will rely on the hosting company that hosts our website to provide advanced security technology to protect our users from any viruses. We need a stable and online hosting platform with competent engineers. If our hosting company does not perform well or if we should have a security breach, we may incur heavy losses. OUR TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR SERVICE. IF THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE CAN'T BE MANAGED WELL TO MEET THE USER'S REQUIREMENTS, OUR BUSINESS GROWTH MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Our platform may contain software with undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Any programming problem discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our service and could create losses due to legal liability issues. A SUCCESSFUL PLATFORM MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO OUR COMPANY. IF A PLATFORM STRATEGY IS FLAWED WE COULD INCURE LOSS. Platform management is very important in the context of operating a website. Maintaining the reliability of the website is always an ongoing priority. Engineers will concentrate on hardware and software configuration, reliable technical support, mobile operation, all in conjunction with our web hosting company. Failure to attain successful platform management could damage our business model and business results. WHEN HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IS NOT OPTIMAL, BUSINESS WILL SUFFER. We consider our human resource plan and implementation critical to the success of our business plan. If we do not have the right plan or if we do not have the right employees and partners to implement our plan our business will suffer. RISKS RELATED TO FINANCE MANAGEMENT INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS AND IF WE FAIL IN OUR EFFORT OUR OVERALL DEVELOPMENT WILL BE HARMED 15 The following factors are key to the Company's international development: language, foreign currency, accounting and tax policies, human resource regulations and insurance, corporate culture, business promotion models, community relations, social environment, content censoring, and other local internet administrative regulations. As a patient website, we may also face additional risks. We are going to provide content in English the following languages: Chinese, French, German, Spanish, Japanese, Italian, and Korean. Multiple-language, multiple-nation and multiple-culture operation ask for experienced local managers. As a new company, we do not have experienced management like our competitors. Hence, we face the following risks: 1. We are not sure we can build up a harmonious local public relations to prevent risks by political, social, or economic instability; 2. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights from country to country; 3. Local media, our reputation, and brand will be affected differently in different countries; 4. Every country has its own laws and regulations to protect patients. Our business behavior may not comply with local laws and regulations concerned with clients and all other user's privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content management, intellectual property, electronic contracts, transmission and distribution and 5. Raising funds in other countries could be challenging. If we are unable to overcome these risks our business will suffer. THERE IS PRESENTLY NO TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK AND NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT AN ACTIVE AND LIQUID TRADING MARKET WILL DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE. ACCORDINGLY, YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO LIQUIDATE YOUR SHARES QUICKLY There is currently no market for our Common Stock and we cannot assure you that a market will develop. We intend to apply to have our shares of Common Stock quoted on the OTCBB, but there are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining such a listing. Once our Common Stock is listed or quoted on an active trading market, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or nonexistent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales. We cannot give you any assurance that an active public trading market for our shares of Common Stock will develop or be sustained. You may not be able to liquidate your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our Common Stock is not active. THE OFFERING PRICE OF THE COMMON STOCK WAS DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRICE OF THE SHARES THAT WERE SOLD TO SOME OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT, AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE USED AS AN INDICATOR OF THE FUTURE MARKET PRICE OF THE SECURITIES. The facts considered in determining the offering price were our financial condition and prospects, our limited operating history, the market capacity, and the general condition of the securities market. The offering price bears no relationship to the book value, assets or earnings of our company or any other recognized criteria of value. The offering price should not be regarded as an indicator of the future market price of the securities. FUTURE ISSUANCE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS. If we raise capital through the issuance of equity, the percentage ownership of our Company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and those shareholders may experience dilution. In addition, we may also have to issue securities that may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our Common Stock. In the event we seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt or its equivalents, this will result in increased interest expense. 16 OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE CONSIDERED A PENNY STOCK, WHICH MAY BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETABILITY. We may be subject now and in the future to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules if our shares of Common Stock sell below $5.00 per share. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. The penny stock rules require broker dealers to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The brokerdealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to completing the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction, the broker dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. The penny stock rules are burdensome and may reduce the purchases of any offerings and reduce the trading market for our shares. As long as our shares of Common Stock are subject to the penny stock rules, the holders of such shares of Common Stock may find it more difficult to sell their securities. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS WE DO NOT HAVE AN INDEPENDENT AUDIT OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, THE ABSENCE OF WHICH COULD LEAD TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OF OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AND WORK AS A DETRIMENT TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS We do not have an independent audit or compensation committee. The absence of an independent audit and compensation committee could lead to conflicts of interest of our officers and directors, which could work as a detriment to our shareholders. WE HAVE A VERY LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS WILL RESULT IN REVENUES OR PROFITS. IF WE CANNOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO OPERATE PROFITABLY, THEN WE MAY SUSPEND OR CEASE OUR OPERATIONS AND YOU COULD EVEN LOSE YOUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK We were incorporated on December 9, 2016 and generated zero revenues or profits through March 31, 2017. We also have very little operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. As of March 31, 2017, we had incurred a net loss of approximately $20,838 since our inception. The success of our future operations is dependent upon our ability to carry out our planned activities, fund our operations and compete effectively with other similar businesses. Based on our current business plan, we expect to incur operating losses during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. We cannot guarantee that we will ever be successful in generating revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and overhead or achieve profitability. Our failure to achieve profitability may cause us to suspend or cease our operations. THERE MAY BE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN OUR MANAGEMENT AND OUR NON-MANAGEMENT STOCKHOLDERS Conflicts of interest create the risk that management may have an incentive to act adversely to the interests of other investors. A conflict of interest may arise between our management's personal pecuniary interest and its fiduciary duty to our stockholders. Further, our management's own pecuniary interest may at some point compromise its fiduciary duty to our stockholders. In addition, our management is involved in other businesses and they may not devote their full attention to the business of the Company. 17 WE DEPEND HEAVILY ON OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND CONSULTANTS AND THE LOSS OF ANY OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKEN OUR MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE AND ABILITY TO RUN OUR BUSINESS Our business strategy and success is dependent on the skills and knowledge of our management team and consultants. As of the date of this prospectus, Dr. Wenyi Yu is our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Jonathan Jay Willard is our Treasurer and Secretary. Both Dr. Wenyi Yu and Ms. Fang Li are directors. We have no other officers or directors and rely on third party consultants to assist with management and, therefore, have little backup capability for their activities. The loss of services of Dr. Wenyi Yu could weaken significantly our management expertise and our ability to efficiently run our business. We do not maintain key man life insurance policies on the life of Dr. Wenyi Yu. TRADING IN OUR SECURITIES COULD BE SUBJECT TO EXTREME PRICE FLUCTUATIONS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT YOUR INVESTMENT Historically speaking, the market prices for securities of small publicly traded companies have been highly volatile. Publicized events and announcements may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock market from time to time experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations that particularly affect the market prices for small publicly traded companies and which are often unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. Following the effectiveness of this offering we plan to seek the listing of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board. However, we cannot assure you that following such a transaction, we will be able to meet the initial listing standards of the OTC Bulletin Board or any other stock exchange, or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on an exchange. In addition, we would be subject to an SEC rule that, if it failed to meet the criteria set forth in such rule, imposes various practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities governed by the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such rule may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our common stock, which may further affect its liquidity. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital following a business combination. SUBSTANTIAL SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY IMPACT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares that we may issue upon exercise of options and warrants, and the resale of shares by investors who may have registration rights, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock, the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be reduced and the price of our common stock may fall. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE We will use any earnings generated from our operations to finance our business and will not pay any cash dividends to our shareholders in the foreseeable future. ISSUING PREFERRED STOCK WITH RIGHTS SENIOR TO THOSE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK Our charter documents grant our board of directors the authority to issue various series of preferred stock without a vote or action by our shareholders. Our board also has the authority to determine the terms of preferred stock, including price, preferences and voting rights. The rights granted to holders of preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock. For example, a series of preferred stock may be granted the right to receive a liquidation preference that would reduce the amount available for distribution to holders of our common stock. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. As a result, common shareholders could be prevented from participating in transactions that would offer an optimal price for their shares. 18 WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE PERIODIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 WHICH WILL REQUIRE US TO INCUR AUDIT FEES AND LEGAL FEES IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION OF SUCH REPORTS. THESE COSTS COULD REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR ABILITY TO EARN A PROFIT We will be required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to comply with these regulations, our independent registered public accounting firm must review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel has to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for their services cannot be accurately predicted at this time, because of factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports. The issues cannot be determined at this time and will have a major effect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys and the fees they charge. The incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our future operations and could have a negative effect on our profits. SHAREHOLDERS MAY BE DILUTED SIGNIFICANTLY THROUGH OUR EFFORTS TO OBTAIN FINANCING AND SATISFY OBLIGATIONS THROUGH ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK We have no committed source of financing. Wherever possible, our board of directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations that have not. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of restricted shares of our common stock. Our board of directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, to issue all or part of our authorized, but unissued, shares of our common stock. Future issuances of shares of our common stock will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders, may further dilute common stock book value and that dilution may be material. OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION PROVIDES FOR INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AT OUR EXPENSE AND LIMIT THEIR LIABILITY, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A MAJOR COST TO US AND HURT THE INTERESTS OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS, BECAUSE CORPORATE RESOURCES MAY BE EXPENDED FOR THE BENEFITS OF OFFICERS AND/OR DIRECTORS Our certificate of incorporation and applicable New York State laws provide for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees and agents under certain circumstances, against attorney's fees and other expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with or activities on our behalf. We will also bear the expenses of such litigation for any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, upon such person's written promise to repay us, if it is ultimately determined that any such person shall not have been entitled to indemnification. This indemnification policy could result in substantial expenditures by us that we may be unable to recoup. We have been advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws is against public policy and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by a director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will (unless in the opinion of our counsel, the matter has been settled by controlling precedent) submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the question of whether indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The legal process relating to this matter, if it were to occur, is likely to be very costly and may result in us receiving negative publicity, either of which factors is likely to materially reduce the market price for our shares, if such a market ever develops. 19 OUR COMMON STOCK BEING REGISTERED WHICH MAY BE SOLD BY SELLING SHAREHOLDERS IS LIKELY TO DEPRESS THE MARKET FOR AND PRICE OF OUR SHARES IN ANY MARKET THAT MAY DEVELOP Our common stock held by the selling shareholders that are being registered in this offering may be sold subsequent to the date of this prospectus, either at once or over a period of time. See also "Selling Shareholders" and "Plan of Distribution" elsewhere in this prospectus. The ability to sell these shares of common stock and/or the sale thereof reduces the likelihood of the establishment and/or maintenance of an orderly trading market for our shares at any time in the near future. THERE ARE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements regarding management's plans and objectives for future operations including plans and objectives relating to our planned marketing efforts and future economic performance. The forward-looking statements and associated risks set forth in this prospectus include or relate to, among other things, (a) our projected sales and profitability, (b) our growth strategies, (c) anticipated trends in our industry, (d) our ability to obtain and retain sufficient capital for future operations and (e) our anticipated needs for working capital. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, the risks outlined under "Risk Factors" and matters described in this prospectus, generally. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus will, in fact, occur. WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FINANCING IN THE FUTURE We have experienced losses from the inception of the Company. As a result, it is likely that we will be required to seek additional financing in the future to respond to increased expenses or shortfalls in anticipated revenues, respond to competitive pressures, develop new or enhanced products, or take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities. We may not be able to find such additional financing on reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when needed, we could be required to modify our business plan in accordance with the extent of available financing. INABILITY TO ATTRACT MARKET MAKERS There is currently no public trading market for our Common Stock. The development of a public trading market depends not only the existence of willing buyers and sellers, but also on market makers. Following the completion of this offering it is contemplated that certain broker-dealers may become market makers for the Common Stock. Under these circumstances, the market bid and asked prices for our Common Stock may be significantly influenced by decisions of the market makers to buy or sell the Common Stock for their own account, which may be critical for the establishment and maintenance of a liquid public market in the Common Stock. Market makers are not required to maintain a continuous two-sided market and are free to withdraw firm quotations at any time. We currently have no market makers. We may not be able to obtain any market makers in the future, and the failure to obtain such market makers could have an adverse impact on the market price of the shares. WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN CONTINUING TO GROW OUR BUSINESS, THEN WE MAY HAVE TO SCALE BACK OR EVEN CEASE OUR ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS We have a limited history of revenues from operations and limited tangible assets. We have yet to generate positive earnings and there can be no assurance that we will ever operate profitably. Our company has a limited operating history and must be considered in the development stage. Our company’s operations will be subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of a developing enterprise and the uncertainties arising from the absence of a significant operating history. If our business plan is not successful, and we are not able to operate profitably, investors may lose some or all of their investment in our company. 20 ANY CHANGE TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION/ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE AND OUR PROFITABILITY The laws, regulations, policies or current administrative practices of any government body, organization of any applicable jurisdiction, may be changed, applied or interpreted in a manner which will fundamentally alter the ability of our Company to carry on our business. The actions, policies or regulations, or changes thereto, of any government body or regulatory agency, or other special interest groups, may have a detrimental effect on us. Any or all of these situations may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and/or our profitability. OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE OTHER TIME COMMITMENTS THAT WILL PREVENT THEM FROM DEVOTING FULL-TIME TO OUR OPERATIONS, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS Our officers and directors do not devote their full working time to operation and management, and as a consequence the implementation of our business plans may be impeded. Our officers and directors have other obligations and time commitments, which may slow our operations and impact our financial results. Additionally, we may not be able to hire additional qualified personnel to replace our officers and directors in a timely manner. If our officers or directors should be unable to fulfill their duties, we may not be able to implement our business plan in a timely manner or at all. FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY (FINRA) SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS MAY LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH COULD DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR SHARES FINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our share price. OUR SECURITY HOLDERS MAY FACE SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON THE RESALE OF OUR SECURITIES DUE TO STATE “BLUE SKY” LAWS Each state has its own securities laws, often called “blue sky” laws, which (i) limit sales of securities to a state’s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (ii) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or the transaction must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker must be registered in that state. We do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. A determination regarding registration will be made by those broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as the market-makers for our common stock. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our securities. You should therefore consider the resale market for our common stock to be limited, as you may be unable to resell your shares without the significant expense of state registration or qualification. 21 INVESTING IN THE COMPANY IS A HIGHLY SPECULATIVE INVESTMENT AND COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF YOUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT A purchase of the offered shares is significantly speculative and involves significant risks. The offered shares should not be purchased by any person who cannot afford the loss of his or her entire purchase price. The business objectives of the Company are also speculative, and we may be unable to satisfy those objectives. The stockholders of the Company may be unable to realize a substantial return on their purchase of the offered shares, or any return whatsoever, and may lose their entire investment in the Company. For this reason, each prospective purchaser of the offered shares should read this prospectus and all of its exhibits carefully and consult with their attorney, business advisor and/or investment advisor prior to purchasing the share. AS A PUBLIC COMPANY, WE WILL INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES Upon the effectiveness of the registration of our shares we will become subject to this the information and reporting requirements of the United States securities laws. The United States securities laws require, among other things, review, audit, and public reporting of our financial results, business activities, and other matters. SEC regulations, including regulations enacted as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has also substantially increased the accounting, legal, and other costs related to becoming and remaining an SEC reporting company. If we do not have current information about our company available to market makers, they will not be able to trade our stock. The public company costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders, will cause our expenses to be higher than they would be if we were privately-held. In addition, we are incurring substantial expenses in connection with the preparation of this Registration Statement. These increased costs may be material and may include the hiring of additional advisors and professionals. Our failure to comply with the federal securities laws could result in private or governmental legal action against us and/or our officers and directors, which could have a detrimental effect on our business, on the value of our stock and on the ability of shareholders to resell the stock. YOU SHOULD RELY ONLY ON THE INFORMATION CONTAINED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS PROSPECTUS AND IN ANY ACCOMPANYING PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT. NO ONE HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE YOU WITH DIFFERENT INFORMATION THE SECURITIES ARE NOT BEING OFFERED IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE THE OFFER IS NOT PERMITTED. YOU SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT THE INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS OR ANY PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT IS ACCURATE AS OF ANY DATE OTHER THAN THE DATE ON THE FRONT OF SUCH DOCUMENTS. WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION This prospectus is part of a registration statement on Form S-1 that we filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the Shares of common stock offered by this prospectus. This prospectus does not contain all of the information set forth in the registration statement and the exhibits and schedule filed therewith. For further information about us and the Shares offered by this prospectus, reference is made to the registration statement and the accompanying exhibits and schedules. A copy of the registration statement and the associated exhibits and schedules may be inspected without charge at the public reference facilities maintained by the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549, and copies of all or any part of the registration statement may be obtained from such office upon the payment of the fees prescribed by the SEC. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information about its public reference room. The SEC maintains a World Wide Web site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding registrants, including us, that file electronically with the SEC. The address of the website is http://www.sec.gov. Our registration statement and the exhibits and schedules we filed electronically with the SEC are available on this site. We are not currently subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, however, we expect to be subject to those informational requirements following the effectiveness of this registration statement. At that time, we will we file reports and other information with the SEC. Such reports and other information can be inspected and/or obtained at the locations and website set forth above. 22 SELLING SHAREHOLDERS AND ANY PURCHASERS OF OUR SECURITIES SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THE MARKET IN OUR STOCK WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RESTRICTIONS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward looking statements. These statements relate to future events or future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this prospectus to confirm our prior statements to actual results. Further, this prospectus contains forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements include, without limitation, all statements as to expectation or belief and statements as to our future results of operations, the progress of the development of our website, the need for, and timing of, additional capital and capital expenditures, partnering prospects, the protection of and the need for additional intellectual property rights, effects of regulations, the need for additional facilities and potential market opportunities. TAX CONSIDERATIONS We are not providing any tax advice as to the acquisition, holding or disposition of the common stock offered herein. In making an investment decision, investors are strongly encouraged to consult their own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal, state and any applicable foreign tax consequences relating to their investment in our common stock. USE OF PROCEEDS Of the 3,327,414 shares of common stock being offered hereby 3,059,500 shares are being registered on behalf of the selling shareholders for an estimated sales price of $ 5.00. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling shareholders. The Company will sell 267,914 shares of common stock for its benefit, and the proceeds to us from this Offering, assuming the sale of all shares being offered hereby are estimated to be approximately $1,339,570. We expect to use such net proceeds as follows: Approximate Approximate Percentage Application of Proceeds Dollar Amount of Net Proceeds Offering expenses $ 279,270 21 % Personnel costs $ 600,000 45 % Website development $ 308,300 23 % Working Capital and General Corporate Purposes(1) $ 152,000 11 % Total: $ 1,339,570 100 % (1) Represents amounts to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including corporate overhead, administration and ongoing professional fees. The net proceeds from this offering, together with internally generated funds, are expected to be adequate to fund our working capital needs for the next 12 months. See "Plan of Operation". There can be no assurance that such funds will be sufficient to fund our operations for 12 months. If not, we could be forced to seek additional funding. There is no assurance we could obtain such funding. (See "Risk Factors".) Pending use of the proceeds from this offering as set forth above, we may invest all or a portion of such proceeds in marketable securities, short-term, interest-bearing securities, U.S. Government securities, money market investments and short-terms, interest-bearing deposits in banks. 23 CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our capitalization at March 31, 2017, and as adjusted to show the sale of the Company shares at a public offering price of $5.00 per share, including the application of the net proceeds of such sale, as described in "Use of Proceeds" above. (Actual) Proforma 3/31/2017 3/31/2017 Current Liabilities 50,582 50,582 Long term liabilities — — Total Liabilities $ 50,582 $ 50,582 Common Stock $.0001 per value per Share; 500,000,000 shares authorized; 20,278,400 and 20,546,314 Shares issued and outstanding, respectively as adjusted (assuming the maximum number of Shares are sold) Par 2,028 2,055 APIC 290,313 1,536,086 Subscription receivable (1 ) (1 ) Accumulated Deficit (25,508 ) (25,508 ) Total Stockholders’ Equity 266,832 1,512,632 Total Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity $ 317,414 $ 1,563,214 (1) Assumes the sale of 267,914 shares, or the maximum number of shares offered by the Company. DILUTION Our net tangible book value at March 31, 2017 is $266,832 or $.013 per share of common stock. Net tangible book value per Share represents the amount of total tangible assets less liabilities, divided by 20,278,400, the number of shares of common stock outstanding at March 31, 2017. See "Description of Capital Stock". "Dilution" means the difference between the public offering price and the pro-forma net tangible book value per share after giving effect to the offering. After giving effect to the sale of 267,914 shares (assuming that the maximum number of shares offered hereby are sold), the as adjusted net tangible book value at March 31, 2017 would be $1,152,632 or $.074 per share. The following table illustrates this per share dilution to investors in the offering: Maximum (2) Public offering per Share of Common Stock Offered herby (1) 5.000 Net tangible book value per Share before offering 0.013 Increase per share attributable to new investors 0.06 As adjusted net tangible book value per share after offering 0.074 Dilution per Share to new investors 4.93 (1) ASSUMES AN OFFERING PRICE OF $5.00 PER SHARE. (2) ASSUMES THE SALE OF 267,914 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OFFERED HEREBY. 24 SHAREHOLDERS As of the date of this Prospectus, the following table sets forth the percentage of equity represented by the Company shares to be purchased by public investors in this offering compared to the percentage of equity to be owned by the present stockholders, and the comparative amounts paid for the shares by the public investors as compared to the total consideration paid by our present stockholders.

The value of our Patient Website is determined by the facts considered in determining the offering price, our financial condition and prospects, our limited operating history and the general condition of the securities market. The offering price of the shares of our Common Stock does not necessarily bear any relationship to our book value, assets, past operating results, financial condition or any other established criteria of value. There is currently no market for our Common Stock and we cannot assure you that a market will develop. We intend to apply to have our shares of Common Stock quoted on the OTCBB marketplace. Before our shares of Common Stock can be quoted on the OTCBB marketplace, FINRA will have to approve a Form 211 Application filed a by a market maker. There can be no assurance that: (1) a market maker will agree to file the Form 211 Application; (2) that FINRA will approve the Form 211 Application; or (3) that our application to be quoted on the OTCBB marketplace will be approved by OTC Markets Group Inc. SELLING SHAREHOLDERS The Selling Shareholders purchased their common stock in a private placement. The shares offered by this prospectus may be offered from time to time by the selling shareholders listed in the following table (“Selling Shareholder”). Each Selling Shareholder will determine the number of shares to be sold and the timing for the sales. Our registration of the shares does not necessarily mean theat the selling shareholders will sell all or any of their shares. Because the Selling Shareholders may offer all, some or none of their shares, no definitive estimate as to the number of shares thereof that will be held by the Selling Shareholders after such offering can be provided, and the following table has been prepared on the assumption that all shares of the common stock offered under this prospectus will ultimately be sold. None of the Selling Shareholders are FINRA registered broker-dealers or affiliates of FINRA registered broker-dealers. None of the Selling Shareholders has had any position, as office director or other material relationship with the Company within the past three years and none of the Selling Shareholders has any continuing relationship with the Company going forward. The Company will file a prospectus supplement to name successors to any named Selling Shareholders who are able to use this prospectus to resell their securities. The Selling Shareholders are listed below along with the number of shares they own and the number of shares they are selling. 25 Prior to the Offering Selling Security Holder (1) Number of Shares of Common Stock Beneficially Owned (2) Shares being Offered (3) Shuwei Jia 1,075,200 1,075,200 Mingchen Gao 930,000 930,000 Jianbin Yan 357,600 357,600 US Export, Inc. 290,000 290,000 Hongyue Sun 100,000 100,000 Huanhuan Wang 88,800 88,800 Kebao Zhang 74,000 74,000 Baoxia Yue 59,200 59,200 Wanming Li 50,000 50,000 Juan Wang 14,800 14,800 Na Li 14,800 14,800 Antoine M.

(3) Assumes that all securities registered will be sold, and that there will be no common stock owned by the Selling Shareholders after such sale. 26 PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION Selling Shareholders None of the Selling Shareholders are FINRA registered broker-dealers or affiliates of FINRA broker-dealers. The Selling Shareholders may offer the common stock at various times in one or more of the following transactions: * on any market that might develop; * in transactions other than market transactions; * by pledge to secure debts or other obligations; * purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account; or * in a combination of any of the above Our shares of common stock offered hereby by the Selling Shareholders may be sold from time to time by such shareholders, or by their pledgees, donees, transferees and other successors in interest thereto. These pledgees, donees, transferees and other successors in interest will also be deemed "Selling Shareholders" for the purposes of this prospectus. The Selling Shareholders will sell at a fixed price of $5.00 per share until our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB), although there is no assurance that our shares will be quoted on the OTCBB on the Board. If our listing on the OTCBB is successful then the Selling Shareholders will sell their shares at prevailing market prices or at privately negotiated prices. In order to comply with the securities laws of certain states, if applicable, the shares may be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. The Selling Shareholders may use broker-dealers to sell shares. If this happens, broker-dealers will either receive discounts or commissions from the Selling Shareholders, or they will receive commissions from purchasers of shares from whom they have acted as agents. To date, no discussions have been held or agreements reached with any broker-dealer. The Selling Shareholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus. Rule 144 provides that any affiliate or other person who sells restricted securities of an issuer for his own account, or any person who sells restricted or any other securities for the account of an affiliate of the issuer of such securities, shall be deemed not to be engaged in a distribution of such securities and, therefore, not to be an underwriter thereof within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, if all of the conditions of Rule 144 are met. Conditions for sales under Rule 144 include: a. adequate current public information with respect to the issuer must be available; b. restricted securities must meet a six-month holding period if purchased from a non-affiliate reporting company or a 12-month holding period if purchased from an affiliate, measured from the date of acquisition of the securities from the issuer or from an affiliate of the issuer; c. sales of restricted or other securities sold for the account of an affiliate during any three-month period, cannot exceed the greater of 1% of the securities of the class outstanding as shown by the most recent statement of the issuer (There is no 1% limitation applied to non-affiliate sales); d. the securities must be sold in ordinary "broker's transactions" within the meaning of section 4(4) of the Securities Act or in transactions directly with a market maker, without solicitation by the selling security holders and without the payment of any extraordinary commissions or fees; 27 e. if the amount of securities to be sold pursuant to Rule 144 during any three month period by an affiliate exceeds 5,000 shares/units or has an aggregate sale price in excess of $50,000, the Selling Shareholder must file a notice on Form 144 with the Commission. The current information requirement listed in (a) above, the volume limitation listed in (c) above, the requirement for sale pursuant to broker's transactions listed in (d) above, and the Form 144 notice filing requirements listed in (e) above, cease to apply to any restricted securities sold for the account of a non-affiliate if at least six months has elapsed from the date the securities were acquired from the issuer or from an affiliate, if purchased from a reporting issuer or 12 months if purchased from a non-reporting issuer. The Selling Shareholders shall have the sole and absolute discretion not to accept any purchase offer or make any sale of shares if they deem the purchase price to be unsatisfactory at any particular time. The Selling Shareholders or their respective pledgees, donees, transferees or other successors in interest, may also sell the shares directly to market makers acting as principals and/or broker-dealers acting as agents for themselves or their customers. Such broker-dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the Selling Shareholders and/or the purchasers of shares for whom such broker-dealer may act as agents or to whom they sell as principal or both, which compensation as to a particular broker-dealer might be in excess of customary commissions. Market makers and block purchasers purchasing the shares will do so for their own account and at their own risk. It is possible that a Selling Shareholder will attempt to sell shares of common stock in block transactions to market makers or other purchasers at a price per share which may be below the then market price. The Selling Shareholders cannot assure that all or any of the shares offered in this prospectus will be sold by the Selling Shareholders. The Selling Shareholders, alternatively, may sell all or part of the shares offered in this prospectus through an underwriter. No Selling Shareholder has entered into any agreement with a prospective underwriter and there is no assurance that any such agreement will be entered into by a Selling Shareholder. In the event that a Selling Shareholder sells all or part of the shares offered in this prospectus through an underwriter, the maximum compensation paid to any such underwriter shall be 8% and shall be paid by such Selling Shareholder. In addition, the selling shareholders may enter into hedging transactions with brokerdealers who may engage in short sales, if short sales were permitted. The selling shareholders may also enter into option or other transactions with brokerdealers that require the delivery by such brokerdealers of the shares, which shares may be resold thereafter pursuant to this prospectus. None of the selling shareholders are brokerdealers or affiliates of broker dealers. We will advise the selling shareholders that the anti-manipulation rules of Regulation M under the Exchange Act may apply to sales of shares in the market and to the activities of the selling shareholders and their affiliates. In addition, we will make copies of this prospectus (as it may be supplemented or amended from time to time) available to the selling shareholders for the purpose of satisfying the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. Brokers, dealers, or agents participating in the distribution of the shares may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling shareholders and/or the purchasers of shares for whom such brokerdealers may act as agent or to whom they may sell as principal, or both (which compensation as to a particular brokerdealer may be in excess of customary commissions). Neither the selling shareholders nor we can presently estimate the amount of such compensation. We know of no existing arrangements between the selling shareholders and any other stockholder, broker, dealer or agent relating to the sale or distribution of the shares. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of the selling shareholders pursuant to this prospectus. We have agreed to bear the expenses of the registration of the shares. Affiliates and/or promoters of the Company who are offering their shares for resale, the Selling Shareholders and any broker-dealers who act in connection with the sale of the shares hereunder will be deemed to be "underwriters" of this offering within the meaning of the Securities Act and any commission they receive and proceeds of any sale of the shares may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act. 28 Selling Shareholders and any purchasers of our securities should be aware that if a trading market develops in our shares, it is anticipated that such trading will be subject to “penny stock” restrictions. We will pay all expenses incident to the registration, offering and sale of the common stock other than commissions or discounts of underwriters, broker-dealers or agents. The Selling Shareholders must comply with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the offer and sale of the common stock. In particular, during such times as the Selling Shareholders may be deemed to be engaged in a distribution of the common stock, and, therefore, be considered to be an underwriter, they must comply with applicable law and we have informed them that they may not, among other things: 1. engage in any stabilization activities in connection with the shares; 2. effect any sale or distribution of the shares until after the prospectus has been appropriately amended or supplemented, if required, to describe the terms of the sale or distribution; and 3. bid for or purchase any of the shares or rights to acquire the shares or attempt to induce any person to purchase any of the shares or rights to acquire the shares, other than as permitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The offering will conclude when all of the 3,327,414 shares of common stock have been sold or we, in our sole discretion, decide to terminate the registration of the shares. We may decide to terminate the registration if it is no longer necessary due to the operation of the resale provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. We also may terminate the offering for no reason whatsoever. CORPORATION The Company will sell the shares directly without the payment of commissions or in the alternative it may engage registered broker dealers. In the latter instance, commissions up to 7% will be paid. At this time the Company has no agreement with a broker dealer to sell the shares. OTCBB CONSIDERATIONS The OTCBB is separate and distinct from the NASDAQ stock market. NASDAQ has no business relationship with issuers of securities quoted on the OTCBB. The SEC's order handling rules, which apply to NASDAQ-listed securities, do not apply to securities quoted on the OTCBB. Although the NASDAQ stock market has rigorous listing standards to ensure the high quality of its issuers and can delist issuers for not meeting those standards, the OTCBB has no listing standards. Rather, it is the market maker who chooses to quote a security on the system, files the application and is obligated to maintain information about the issuer in its files. The only requirement for ongoing inclusion in the OTCBB is that the issuer must be current in its reporting requirements with the SEC. Investors may have difficulty in getting orders filled, because trading activity on the OTCBB in general is not conducted as efficiently and effectively as with NASDAQ-listed securities. As a result, investors' orders may be filled at prices much different than expected when orders are placed. Investors must contact a broker-dealer to trade OTCBB securities. Investors do not have direct access to the bulletin board service. For bulletin board securities, there only has to be one market maker. OTCBB transactions are conducted almost entirely on a manual basis. Because there are no automated systems for negotiating trades on the OTCBB, they are conducted via telephone. In times of heavy market volume, the limitations of this process may result in a significant increase in the time it takes to execute investor orders. Therefore, when investors place market orders-- an order to buy or sell a specific number of shares at the current market price-- it is possible for the prices of a stock to go up or down significantly during the lapse of time between placing a market order and obtaining execution. 29 SECTION 15(g) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 = PENNY STOCK RULES Our shares are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rules 15g-1 through 15g-6 promulgated thereunder. They impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities -- assuming our shares are traded on the OTCBB and that our shares are traded below $5.00 per share -- to persons other that established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worths in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouses). Rule 15g-1 exempts a number of specific transactions from the scope of the penny stock rules (but is not applicable to us). Rule 15g-2 declares unlawful broker-dealer transactions in penny stocks unless the broker-dealer has first provided to the customer a standardized disclosure document. Rule 15g-3 provides that it is unlawful for a broker-dealer to engage in a penny stock transaction unless the broker-dealer first discloses and subsequently confirms to its customers current quotation prices or similar market information concerning the penny stock in question. Rule 15g-4 prohibits broker-dealers from completing penny stock transactions for a customer unless the broker-dealer first discloses to the customer the amount of compensation or other remuneration received as a result of the penny stock transaction. Rule 15g-5 requires that a broker-dealer executing a penny stock transaction, other than one exempt under Rule 15g-1, disclose to its customer, at the time of or prior to the transaction, information about the sales person's compensation and the compensation of any associated person of the broker-dealer. Rule 15g-6 requires broker-dealers selling penny stocks to provide their customers with monthly account statements. Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a "penny stock" for purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a minimum bid price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to a limited number of exceptions. It is likely that our shares will be considered to be penny stocks for the immediately foreseeable future. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the penny stock rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchase. In order to approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives of the person and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that that person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, sets forth: * the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and * that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. The above-referenced requirements may create a lack of liquidity, making trading in our common stock difficult or impossible, and accordingly, shareholders may find it difficult to dispose of our shares. 30 STATE SECURITIES-BLUE SKY LAWS There is no established public market for our common stock and there can be no assurances that any market will develop in the foreseeable future. Transfer of our common stock may also be restricted under the securities laws or securities regulations promulgated by various states, commonly referred to as "blue sky" laws. Absent compliance with such individual state laws, our common stock may not be traded in such jurisdiction. Because the common stock registered hereunder has not been registered for resale under blue sky laws of every state, the holders of such shares and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future, should be aware that there may be significant state blue sky law restrictions upon the ability of investors to sell the common stock. Accordingly, investors may not be able to liquidate their investments and should be prepared to hold the common stock for an indefinite period of time. Selling Shareholders may contact us directly to ascertain procedures necessary for compliance with blue sky laws in the applicable states relating to sellers and/or purchasers of shares of our common stock. We may apply for listing in Mergent, Inc., a leading provider of business and financial information on publicly listed and quoted companies, which, once published, will provide the "manual" exemptions in approximately 39 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands, as indicated in CCH Blue Sky Law Desk Reference at Section 6301 entitled "Standard Manuals Exemptions." Thirty-nine states, certain U.S. Territories (Guam, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands) and the District of Columbia have what is commonly referred to as a "manual exemption" for secondary trading of securities such as those to be resold by Selling Shareholders under this registration statement. In these states, territories and district, so long as we obtain and maintain a listing in Mergent, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporate Manual, secondary trading of our common stock can occur without filing, review or approval by state regulatory authorities in these states. These states are: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Delaware, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. We cannot secure this listing, and thus this qualification, until after our registration statement is declared effective, however, there is no assurance we will be able to obtain this listing. Once we secure this listing, secondary trading can occur in these states without further action. We currently do not intend to and may not be able to qualify securities for resale in other states which require shares to be qualified before they can resold by our shareholders. LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY REGULATION M Under applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the shares may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to our common stock for a period of two business days prior to the commencement of such distribution. In addition and without limiting the foregoing, each Selling Shareholder will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the associated rules and regulations thereunder, including, without limitation Regulation M, which provisions may limit the timing of purchases and sales of shares of our common stock by the Selling Shareholders. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the Selling Shareholders and have informed them of the need for delivery of copies of this prospectus to purchasers at or prior to the time of any sale of the shares offered hereby. We have notified the Selling Shareholders that the Company will assume no obligation to deliver copies of this prospectus or any related prospectus supplement. That will be the obligation of the Selling Shareholders. 31 MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS As of March 31, 2017, we had 20,278,400 shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. There currently exists no public trading market for our common stock. We do not expect a public trading market to develop until we become a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. There can be no assurance that a public trading market will develop now or in the future. Without an active public trading market, investors in this offering may be unable to liquidate their shares of our common stock without considerable delay, if at all. If a market does develop, the price for our shares may be highly volatile and may bear no relationship to our actual financial condition or results of operations. Factors we discuss in this prospectus, including the many risks factors associated with an investment in the Company, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. Also, because of the relatively low price at which our common stock will likely trade, many brokerage firms may not effect transactions in our common stock. (See discussion regarding penny stocks.) At the present time, none of our shares of common stock are eligible for sale under Rule 144 of the Securities and Exchange Commission. HOLDERS As of March 31, 2017, there were approximately 19 shareholders of record of our common stock. DIVIDENDS We have not paid cash dividends on any class of common equity since formation and we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our outstanding common stock in the foreseeable future; however, there are no material restrictions that prohibit or limit our ability to pay dividends on our outstanding securities. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES COMMON STOCK We are authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $.0001 per share. As of March 31, 2017, 20,278,400 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding. Each outstanding share of common stock is entitled to one vote, either in person or by proxy, on all matters that may be voted upon by the owners thereof at meetings of the stockholders. Our shareholders have no pre-emptive rights to acquire additional shares of common stock. The common stock is not subject to redemption or any sinking fund provision, and it carries no subscription or conversion rights. In the event of our liquidation, the holders of the common stock will be entitled to share equally in the corporate assets after satisfaction of all liabilities. The description contained in this section does not purport to be complete. Reference is made to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which are available for inspection upon proper notice at our offices, as well as to the New York Corporation Code for a more complete description covering the rights and liabilities of shareholders. The holders of our common stock: (i) have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available therefore, if declared by our Board of Directors, (ii) are entitled to share ratably in all our assets available for distribution to holders of common stock upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up; (iii) do not have preemptive, subscription or conversion rights or redemption or sinking fund provisions; and (iv) are entitled to one non-cumulative vote per share on all matters on which stockholders may vote at all meetings of our stockholders. 32 The holders of shares of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more than fifty percent (50%) of outstanding shares voting for the election of directors can elect all of our directors if they so choose and, in such event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any of our directors. DIVIDENDS Our board of directors has not declared a dividend on our common stock since our inception and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the near future, as we intend to reinvest our earnings, if any, to improve and increase our operations. SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE There has been no public market for our common stock and we cannot assure you that a significant public market for our common stock will be developed or be sustained in the future. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the possibility of substantial sales occurring, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock or our future ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities. We have not issued any options or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into, our common stock. PREFERRED STOCK We are authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share from time to time in one or more series. As of the date of this prospectus, no shares of preferred stock have been issued. Our Board of Directors, without further approval of our stockholders, is authorized under our Articles of Incorporation to provide for the issuance of shares of preferred stock, by resolution or resolutions, and, by filing an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation under Nevada law, to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof without any further vote or action by the shareholders. Any shares of preferred stock so issued are likely to have priority over our common stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights. The authority of the Board of Directors with respect to the Preferred Stock shall include, but not be limited to, setting or changing the following: 1. the annual dividend rate, if any, on shares of Preferred Stock, the times of payment and the date from which dividends shall be accumulated, if dividends are to be cumulative; 2. whether the shares of Preferred Stock shall be redeemable and, if so, the redemption price and the terms and conditions of such redemption; 3. the obligation, if any, of the Company to redeem shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to a sinking fund; 4. whether shares of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of stock of any other class or classes and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange, including the price or prices or the rate or rates of conversion or exchange and the terms of adjustment, if any; 5. whether the shares of Preferred Stock shall have voting rights, and, if so, the extent of such voting rights; 6. the rights of the shares of Preferred Stock in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation; and 7. any other relative rights, powers, preferences, qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof relating to the Preferred Stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction, or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders. In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock. Although the Board of Directors is required to make any determination to issue such stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of our stockholders, the Board of Directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock. The Board of Directors does not at present intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized preferred stock, unless otherwise required by law. 33 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS Article III of the Company’s Bylaws provides that present or future directors or officer may be indemnified and held harmless for their acts as representative of the Company to the fullest extent legally permissible under the laws of the state of Nevada. The expenses of officers and directors incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by us as they are incurred and in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding, if and only if the officer or director undertakes to repay said expenses to us if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the officer or director is not entitled to be indemnified by us. The indemnification and advancement of expenses may not be made to or on behalf of any officer or director if a final adjudication establishes that the officer’s or director’s acts or omission involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law and was material to the cause of action. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the Company under the terms of the bylaws, the Company has been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is therefore unenforceable. WARRANTS AND OPTIONS We have no outstanding stock options or warrants. However, we anticipate implementing a stock option and compensation plan in the future to provide for the issuance of common stock our officers, key personnel and consultants. REGISTRATION RIGHTS We have not granted registration rights to the Selling Shareholders or to any other person. REPORTS TO SHAREHOLDERS We intend to furnish our shareholders with annual reports that will describe the nature and scope of our business and operations for the prior year and will contain a copy of our audited financial statements for our most recent fiscal year. LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS Article VI of the Company's amended Certificate of Incorporation provides that our directors and officers shall not be personally liable to the Company or our stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty. However, Article III of the Company’s Bylaws provides that a director shall be liable to the extent provided by applicable law (i) for acts or breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Company or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, or (iii) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Company History US EXP GROUP INC. was incorporated in New York State on December 9, 2016. It was migrated to Nevada effective June 14, 2017. Its principal business address is 160 Kerns Avenue, Buffalo, NY 14211. It is authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stocks at par value $0.0001. The founder of the Company is Dr. Wenyi Yu. Dr. Yu has three degrees: 1. Bachelor of Medicine (Clinical Practice, 1984), 2. Master of Medicine (Surgery, 1991), 3. Ph.D. of Economics (Industrial Economics, 1993). Dr. Yu lectured for MBA candidates in industrial management (1993-1998), was a senior economist in industrial investment (1999), and was a professor in labor economics (2010-2011). He was a founder of the Center for Film and Television Studies (2005), and currently is a senior research fellow in cultural industries and finance. His expertise is in regional economic development and planning of cultural industries. His interests range from robotic film production to theater renovation. In 2012, Dr. Yu produced a regional economic development strategy called the Regional Economy Engine (REE). His company US Export, Inc. purchased a campus in east Buffalo, New York to begin this project. Since that time, he met neighbors and found many people suffering from diseases such as: lung cancer, diabetes, obesity, drug addiction, chronic pain, lupus, heart disease, and retina detachment. Some patients had families or lived alone. Regardless of their situation, life became harder because their illness and due to their agony. Dr. Yu found that once people had suffered a chronic disease, their life goals had to be adjusted. The goal was no longer to have a good life, but to make a difficult life better. This is especially true for patients with a long history of illness. In March of 2016, Dr. Yu began to study the relationship between patients and social concerns. In November 2016, Dr. Yu conceived a solution to these problems. His solution was to develop in a specialized social media platform focused on patient communications through a patient communication website. Dr. Yu and his team members have developed a comparison among four different programs and requested advice from well-known experts. He visited Harvard Medical School to investigate a North American medical magazine; he has drafted a plan with a pharmaceutical scientist of a famous cancer institute in New York State for the establishment of New Concept Anti-Cancer Therapeutics Center. On December 26, 2016, after evaluation of four different business proposals, Dr. Yu and his team made an important decision to develop the patient website. One of the reasons supporting this decision was that they had found that few material achievements have been made for most diseases though huge investments that have been made in drug development and bio-engineering. They were astonished by WHO’s statistics which indicate, “It is expected that annual cancer cases will rise from 14 million in 2012 to 22 (million) within the next 2 decades,” and the American Cancer Society’s report which noted: “In 2016, there will be an estimated 1,685,210 new cancer cases diagnosed and 595,690 cancer deaths in the US.” 35 Corporate Strategy A successful corporate management endeavor needs a strong leadership team with rich successful practice experience. Director Fang Li is well qualified with extensive experience which makes her the clear choice for this position. She will be responsible for leading the planning and implementation of our corporate strategy. Ms. Li’s independent achievements in medicine and business demonstrate her proven track record. After opening her own clinic, and as the only doctor providing service, Ms. Li grew her clinic for 29 years (1988-2017) into a hospital with 120 employees. Dr. Wenyi Yu is a senior expert in industrial planning, has served as chief economist and team leader, and presided over 10 plans for regional economic and industrial development. As a Director and CEO of the Company, he has significant theoretical training and experience in the studies of corporate strategy and business models. As an MBA instructor and senior research fellow, he has published original works such as Science of Management Analysis (580 pages, 1988); Super Movie Study (260 pages, 2005). As a business manager, he founded UFSOFT Management Institute of YONYOU NETWORK TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD in 1998. Dr. Yu will support Director Fang Li in corporate strategic management through quantitative economic models. By comparative study, difference study, and SWOT analysis, the Company has decided to introduce Events-Driven Strategy (EDS) to incubate the website. The Brand Strategy, quality control strategy, and sustainable development strategy will be integrated into EDS. US EXP GROUP INC. was formed under the laws of the State of New York on December 9, 2016, for the purpose of developing and operating an internet website designed to respond to the needs of healthcare patients. The Internet has untapped potential for treating psychological and spiritual infirmities, yet there are few websites that focus on patients’ psychological and spiritual recovery. This leaves an opportunity for our business development. We have designed a website that will create a patient world (PWORLD) where patients can communicate, create, exhibit, transact, invest, entertain, date, look for jobs, hold events, raise funds, donate, and search medical resources. We are going to introduce a literature and artistic event-driven model (L Model) to activate the target population. We believe this approach will enrich patients’ lives, and make their lives better. Today, the principal focus of medical websites is oriented towards diagnosis and treatment. Their direct purpose is to solve a specific physical problem, not to promote a patient’s psychological and spiritual well-being. Other online medical resources have not fully realized the value of patients’ spiritual resources, which can highly benefit patients. One of the most difficult obstacles for patients in these situations is the need to share their thoughts with others. However, a small hospital ward or an empty family house makes such sharing of ideas impossible. From the moment a patient suffers from an illness, their quality of life may begin to decrease. Under these circumstances, the only thing we can do is to prevent deterioration and fight for a quality of life undiminished by illness. If one accepts it, the Internet and web technology presents a historic opportunity. Based on the Hawthorne Effect in industrial relations research, we anticipate communication, creative endeavors, and entertainment may improve a patient’s life. Therefore, we have produced a business plan designed to create a virtual patient world (PWORLD), as described in detail below: Presumption : communication and creative work can improve a patients’ quality of life Mission : to enrich the patients’ life, to make patients’ life more enjoyable 36 Vision: to create a virtual patient world Target : to serve 8 different language groups within 2 years Platform : www.PWORLD.net Design: Presumption and Philosophy Our presumption is that appropriate, patient enabled communications and social concerns will have the potential to enrich a patient’s life. This presumption has something in common with The Hawthorn Effect which concluded that the workers’ productivity was not being affected by the changes in working conditions, but rather by the fact that someone cared about their working conditions. Our principle is Patient Priorities, where we will treasure a patient’s own social expressions and their creative works. Our way is trying to assist a patient, if they are not already active, to become a writer, a musician, a poet, a painter, a film producer, an artistic crafts creator, a toy designer, or even a medical researcher. In fact the website can function as a micro online publisher. We can exhibit patient’s works in multiple languages and let patients around the world share their experiences, thoughts, and achievements simultaneously. To avoid loneliness, patients not only need to share experiences with other patients, but they also need to communicate with doctors, psychologists, nutritionists, medical equipment representatives, and physical therapists. Patients also demand to share cutting edge medical achievements. Undoubtedly, medical professionals are capable of playing a critical role in enriching patient’s life. We also expect to publish medical news. The website provides space for both sides, the professional, as well as patient-driven content. Our goal is to improve our patients quality of life through information, sharing experiences, and publishing creative works, descriptions of treatment, comments and suggestions to doctors and therapists, impressions of surgeries, equipment, rehabilitation, hospital and clinic culture, family responses, and social concerns, etc. The patient’s contribution may be a journal, a novel, poetry or prose, essays, music, paintings, photography, videos, any method at all. Only when we can utilize all our talents are we self-actualized people. We believe that the publication of these works can promote communication for all, patients, family, and the medical community. Works by patients will be crucial in enriching their lives and all of us too. We also believe that full communication will increase a patient’s spiritual and emotional resources in order to help them to overcome difficulties. We also anticipate that the creative works have commercial value for the author. Creative endeavors enrich patients’ lives, and this is the essence of our world outlook, and also the philosophy in designing and operating www.PWORLD.net.

Cost per impression (CPI), or "cost per thousand impressions" (CPM) refers to the cost of internet marketing where advertisers pay each time an ad is displayed. 2. Cost Per Click (CPC) is a method websites use to bill based on the number of times a visitor clicks on an advertisement. 3. Cost per acquisition (CPA), also known as "Cost per action" or pay per acquisition (PPA) and cost per conversion, is an online advertising pricing model where the advertiser pays for a specified acquisition - for example a sale, click, or form submit (e.g., contact request, newsletter sign up, registration etc.) 4. Flat rate. The advertiser pays a fixed price to display an ad for a period of time.

Revenue Recognition principle We plan to develop virtual currency, which can be used to buy things on our website. When a user buys our virtual currency, upon receipt of the payment, we record the value purchased as deferred revenue and we credit the user’s deposit. As a general rule, an entity is considered a principal if it controls a good or service before it is transferred to a customer. A principal provides goods or services to the customer, and reports revenue based on the gross amount received from the customer. On the other hand, an agent arranges for another party to provide goods or services and the agent recognizes only its fee or commission. We will comply with applicable accounting guidelines and identify the Company’s status as a principal or as an agent, based on the following criteria: 1. If we receive revenue as a principal, we will pay platform developer associated fees, and account for the rest of the transaction amount as our revenue; 2. If we receive revenue as an agent, we will record a fee from the transaction, and remit the rest of the revenue to the platform developer.

We will require our employees, consultants, sub-contractors and all users to comply with the website's Terms of Use and to comply with federal and state laws and regulations. There are four important statutes that will impact our services: 1. Section 512 (c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998. This law removes liability for copyright infringement from websites that allow users to post, as long as the site has a mechanism in place whereby the copyright owner can request the removal of infringing content. According to the section on intellectual property (IP), if a user posted content with IP issues on our website, this may not be our responsibility, and we can protect our Company from copyright infringement claims, the prerequisite is our site must not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity. However, we will ask our employees and users not to publish other people’s private facts such as medical condition, sexual activities, or financial troubles on our website without permission. 2. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act(CDA) of 1996. This law immunizes website from certain liability resulting from the publication of information provided by another. It protects freedom of expression and innovation on the internet and says that “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider,” but CDA provides protection only if an employee or someone acting under the Company’s instruction does not make the mistake but instead the posts are made by users on our blog or website. This situation usually arises in the context of defamation, privacy, negligence and other tort claims which are governed by other laws. CDA 230 does not cover criminal liability, copyright infringement or other intellectual property claims. 3. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule §312.3 (COPPA) of Electronic Code of Federal Regulations. This law spells out what a web site operator must include in a privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent and what responsibilities an operator has to protect children’s privacy and safety online. Our website will have contents of patients under the age of 18 years and are liable for compliance under the Act. 4. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services HIPAA Privacy Rule. This rule requires doctors, nurses, pharmacies, hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care providers to protect the privacy of individual health information. We will remind users of the risks and responsibilities related to the posting of health information. In addition, we also plan to put procedures in place to protect against potential threats such as disclosure of confidential information, unauthorized use/infringement of intellectual property, defamation, endorsements, et al, which may happen on web forum, threads, and blog where users may post anything they want. Other Regulations We are also subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations based on our event-driven and multiple-service business model. All services related to online advertising, e-commerce, and digital entertainment may be involved into intellectual property issues. In order to assure to our compliance we will prepare a law directory as integrated standing tool of our services while planning the website and all the events. The Company will implement policies to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we will establish a channel connecting our professional legal service team to deal promptly with legal issues that might arise from the operation of the website.

ICD-11: Disease Coding Standards The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the standard diagnostic tool for epidemiology, health management, and clinical purposes. This includes the analysis of the general health situation of population groups. It is used to monitor the incidence and prevalence of diseases and other health problems, providing a picture of the general health situation of countries and populations. Our website will use these codes to group blog post discussions and featured articles in easy to find database. The Management of Digital Entertainment and Contents Classification We are planning to classify films by the type of disease. For example, Love Story, a 1970 film directed by Arthur Hiller, is the story of a patient with leukemia. Our users who suffer the same disease may watch the film, and hopefully improve their spiritual state. We are going to set up our own film classification system in order to provide individualized service. This is a very complicated assignment and needs a professional team to fulfill it. 62 DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS PLAN Events Plan To fulfill the mission of enriching patients’ lives, the Company plans to sponsor four kinds of events: P-Day, Seasonal Events, Holiday Events, and Individualized Events.

We consider a quality individualized service as a sign that we can improve patients’ life. Our individualized service will become a regular, daily program. The following are some of the programs we plan to develop for individuals. P-Birthday . Birthday events may be recognized as an important milestone in a patient’s life. To bring more public concerns to our patients, we will utilize our resources to improve the patient’s spirits. Since birthdays are very important to a patient, we are going to invite, a professional birthday event management consultant to produce a plan for us in order to organize a quality virtual birthday party for our users. We may hire a professional event manager and a good presenter to assure the quality of the event. Recovery Day . A recovery day is the day when you feel good, your pain is relieved, your lab results turn normal, your operation is successful, you stop using medication, you are discharged from the hospital, your hypochondriasis is released..., which is a historic moment that deserves to be celebrated. You can request a song, a film, an animation or a game and enjoy it without charge. Audiences may order a flower as a gift for you from the website. Delivery Day. It is the day a mother gives birth to a child. It is also a most happy day that people worldwide should celebrate. Our website shall invite people around the world to share the excitement of the mother and her family, and also celebrate the birth of the child.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (Unaudited) and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Registration Statement. Our discussion includes forward – looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward – looking statements as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. Although management believes that the assumptions made and expectations reflected in the forward – looking statements are reasonable, there is no assurance that the underlying assumptions will, in fact, prove to be correct or that actual results will not be different from expectations expressed in this report. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Assets Total assets comprised of cash and property and equipment. During the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (Unaudited), the company has purchased the building at 160 Kerns Avenue, Buffalo, NY, at its historical cost of $290,000, which will act as its headquarter and facilities for events to be sponsored by the company. The building on the property is 83,553 square foot and has a theatre, gymnasium, cafeteria, press conference room, store, dormitory, outdoor sports field and parking lot. The property in general is in good condition. Liabilities The only liability of $50,582 is an advance of funds by a shareholder for use as working capital. Operating Expenses During the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (Unaudited), the Company incurred expenses of $20,838 for its initial start-up and public offering. These consisted mainly of professional fees and salaries. Earnings or Losses after Taxes The company incurred a net loss of $20,838 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (Unaudited) resulting from its operating expenses as there was no operating income in the quarter. Cash Flow from Operations The company generated a positive cash flow of $21,754 from its operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (Unaudited), which is mainly attributable to the financing activities of the company. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The company has also entered into 3 consulting agreements and 1 employment agreement. The compensation for these agreements included payment of cash and issuance of common stock of the company at a price of $5 per share. In total 1,400 shares were issued for these agreements. As of March 31, 2017 (Unaudited), the company has $24,499 cash on hand. The company also had a stockholders’ equity of $266,832, but a working capital deficiency of $26,083 and accumulated deficit of $25,508. The positive stockholders’ equity was due to the issuance of 3,064,900 common shares for a value of $290,577. 74 FINANCIAL CONDITION The company currently anticipates that its available cash resources will not be sufficient to meet its anticipated working capital for the next 12 months. We intend to rely upon the issuance of common stock and loans and advances from shareholders to fund the operation of the company and the development of the website. If additional funds are raised through the further issuances of equity, the percentage ownership of current stockholders will be reduced. In addition, the company may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on terms favorable to the company, the business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. GOING CONCERN Note 2 of the company’s attached financial statements notes that the company has yet to achieve profitable operations and that it has incurred losses from its inception in the amount of $25,508.

(See accompanying notes to condensed financial statements) 80 US EXP GROUP INC. Notes to Condensed Financial Statements March 31, 2017 (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations US EXP Group Inc. (the “Company” or “we” or “us”) was incorporated in New York on December 9, 2016. The Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock (see note 6) with a with par value $0.0001. The Company will build www.PWORLD.net (the “Website”), which aims at creating a platform for patients. The Website will provide a communication platform for patients and medical professionals, provide information, digital entertainment, exhibit patients’ creative works, organize events, and conduct fund raising. The Website will also provide an e-commerce function. Online advertisement will be its important revenue source. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim information Regulation S-K. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of a normal and recurring nature considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2017. US EXP Group Inc. (Company) is a business whose planned principal operations are the creation, operation, and maintenance of www.PWORLD.net (the Website) that aims at creating a virtual patient world to provide humanistic and artistic concerns for patients through enriching their lives by the online platform for communication among patients and medical professionals, the exhibition and auction of patients’ creative works, the publication of Patients’ Daily and Medical Daily, the services of wellness digital entertainment, e-commerce, and advertising, which is driven by a series of events all year round. The presumption is that communication and creative work can make patients’ life more enjoyable, hence to enhance spiritual and psychological recovery and improve quality of life. The Company is currently conducting the design of the Website, the preparation of promotional events and related activities in order to operationalize the online services. During the last year, the Company completed the conceptual and technical design of the Website, which combines the classic theory of Hawthorne Effect, the function of artistic creation, and the technology and service of Internet in order to produce a unique service model through the multiple language virtual patients’ world PWORLD.net. The Company registered “www.PWORLD.net” as a pending trademark in international classes of 41 and 42. The LOGO design has also finished. On March 3, 2017, the Company purchased a high school in Buffalo, NY as the headquarter and events center of the Website. A Wellness Film Academy is under design based on the property. The building of the Website is scheduled to be completed by June 28, 2017, the site technical support is GoDaddy, located in Arizona. 81 US EXP GROUP INC. Notes to Condensed Financial Statements March 31, 2017 (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) February 18, 2017, the Wellness Film Festival, the Wellness Game Platform, and the Wellness Painting and Photography Exhibition and Auction (P Mall) all are in the preparation. We have a 20-member think tank in Buffalo, NY, including an economist, strategic consultant, business leadership lecturer, MBA, medical doctor, acupuncturist, pharmacologist, film studio director, film producer and film festival organizer, photographer, professional painter, professional writer, language scholar, professor in sociology, professor in communication, IT engineer and website builder, marketing expert, social activist, CPA, and corporate lawyer. Those members have worked together for 2-6 years. Our core members have organized an international patients’ team to endorse the Website. We are going to find some advertisers to support our events. The Company also is in the process of raising additional equity capital to support the completion of its development activities to provide the services as soon as possible. The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding to operationalize the website before another company develops a similar business model. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists (sales agreements and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement); (ii) delivery of goods has occurred and risks and benefits of ownership have been transferred, which is when the goods are received by the customer at its designated location in accordance with the sales terms; (iii) the sales price is both fixed and determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Concentration As of March 31, 2017, the Company was dependent on its CEO and principal shareholder to provide financing for operations. 82 US EXP GROUP INC. Notes to Condensed Financial Statements March 31, 2017 (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Advertising Advertising revenues are derived principally from online advertising and marketing, including display advertising and promoted marketing, and, to a lesser extent, sponsorship arrangements. The arrangements are evidenced by either online acceptance of terms and conditions or contracts that stipulate the types of advertising to be delivered, the timing and the pricing. Display advertising arrangements allow advertisers to place advertisements on particular areas of the Company’s websites or platform, in particular formats and over particular periods of time. Advertising revenues from display advertising arrangements are recognized ratably over the contract period of display, when the collectability is reasonably assured. The Company enters into cost per day (“CPD”) advertising arrangements with customers, under which the Company recognizes revenues ratably over the contract period. The Company also enters into cost per mille (“CPM”), or cost per thousand impressions, advertising arrangements with the customers, under which the Company recognizes revenues based on the number of times that the advertisement has been displayed. Promoted marketing arrangements are primarily priced based on CPM or cost per engagement (“CPE”). An engagement may include when a user clicks on a link, becomes a follower of the marketing customer account, shares the promoted feed or marks the feed as a favorite. Under the CPM model, customers are obligated to pay when the advertisement is displayed, while under the CPE model, customers are obligated to pay based on the number of engagements with the marketing feed. Sponsorship arrangements allow advertisers to sponsor a particular area on its websites in exchange for a fixed payment over the contract period. Advertising revenues from sponsorship are recognized ratably over the contract period. Advertising revenues derived from the design, coordination and integration of online advertising and sponsorship arrangements to be placed on the Company’s websites are recognized ratably over the term of such arrangements. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis. Payments and Other Fees We enable Payments from people to purchase physical, virtual and digital goods from our developers. People can transact and make payments on the Website by using debit cards and credit cards, PayPal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. 83 US EXP GROUP INC. Notes to Condensed Financial Statements March 31, 2017 (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) When a person engages in a payment transaction for the purchase of a physical, virtual or digital good from a seller, we remit to the seller an amount that is based on the total amount of the transaction less the processing fee that we charge the seller. The price of the purchase is an amount that is solely determined by the seller. Our revenue is the net amount of the transaction, representing our processing fee for the service performed. We record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the physical or virtual or digital good to the person. Additionally, we record all Payments revenue at the time of the purchase of the related virtual goods, net of estimated refunds or chargebacks. Other fees, which includes the delivery of virtual reality platform devices and related platform sales, and our ad serving and measurement products, were not material in all periods presented in our financial statements. Revenue is recognized net of applicable sales and other taxes. Cost of Revenue Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of intangible assets, costs associated with data partner arrangements, and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold. Income Taxes Under ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of March 31, 2017, there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration. Loss Per Common Share Basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity. As of March 31, 2017, there are no outstanding dilutive securities. 84 US EXP GROUP INC. Notes to Condensed Financial Statements March 31, 2017 (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-Income Taxes. The Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative). The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is still in the process of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard. Management believes that the impact of this ASU to the Company’s financial statements would be insignificant. 85 US EXP GROUP INC. Notes to Condensed Financial Statements March 31, 2017 (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows”. The amendments provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: (1) Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs; (2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination; (4)Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned; (6) Life Insurance Policies; (7) Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees; (8) Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions; and Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other than Inventory”, which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-06 will be effective for the Company in its first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 on its consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, “Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control”. The amendments affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate a variable interest entity in certain situations involving entities under common control. Specifically, the amendments change the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. 86 US EXP GROUP INC. Notes to Condensed Financial Statements March 31, 2017 (Unaudited) Note 2. Going Concern The Company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to date and has sustained operating loss of $20,838 during the period ended March 31, 2017. The Company had a working capital of $26,083 and an accumulated deficit of $25,508 as of March 31, 2017. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources, as may be required. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. In order to maintain its current level of operations, the Company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from operations or from the sale of its equity. However, the Company currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase of its equity. If the Company is unable to acquire additional working capital, it will be required to significantly reduce its current level of operations. Note 3.

Note 4. Related Party Transactions Due to a related party amounted to $50,582 as of March 31, 2017. Due to a related party are loans borrowed from a shareholder for operation purpose. The loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on demand. 87 US EXP GROUP INC. Notes to Condensed Financial Statements March 31, 2017 (Unaudited) Note 5. Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) The Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock with par value $0.0001. On December 15, 2016, the Company issued 14,213,500 shares of common stock to its CEO for $1,421 at $0.0001 per share. The amount was received on December 16, 2016. On December 15, 2016, the Company issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock to a director for $300 at $0.0001 per share. The amount was received in February 28, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company received a contribution from officers of $342. The contributions were recorded under additional paid in capital. In 2017, the Company issued 1,400 shares for services provided with a fair value of $5 ($0.0001 per share). In January 2017, the Company issued 2,773,500 shares to 15 shareholders for $277.35 for cash ($0.0001 per share). In February 2017, the Company issued 290,000 shares to US Export Inc. in exchange for a building. The shares were valued at the historical cost of the asset. US Export Inc. is a shareholder of the Company and is majority owned by the same CEO. Note 6. Subsequent Event On May 3, 2017, the Company received a loan of $10,000 from its CEO for working capital. The loan is a non-secured, non interest and due on demand. On June 14, 2017, the Company redomiciled from a New York corporation to a Nevada corporation with 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 and 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001. Management has evaluated subsequent events through June 27, 2017, the date which the financial statements were available to be issued. All subsequent events requiring recognition as of March 31, 2017 have been incorporated into these financial statements and there are no other subsequent events that require disclosure in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 855, “Subsequent Events.” 88 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors of: US EXP Group, Inc. We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of US EXP Group, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and the related statement of operations, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for the period December 9, 2016 (date of incorporation) to December 31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects, the financial position of US EXP Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period December 9, 2016 (date of incorporation) to December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has a net loss of $4,670, a working capital deficit of $2,907 and used cash in operations of $4,670 for the year ended December 31, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. LIGGETT & WEBB, P.A.

(Company) is a business whose planned principal operations are the creation, operation, and maintenance of www.PWORLD.net (the Website) that aims at creating a virtual patient world to provide humanistic and artistic concerns for patients through enriching their lives by the online platform for communication among patients and medical professionals, the exhibition and auction of patients’ creative works, the publication of Patients’ Daily and Medical Daily, the services of wellness digital entertainment, e-commerce, and advertising, which is driven by a series of events all year round. The presumption is that communication and creative work can make patients’ life more enjoyable, hence to enhance spiritual and psychological recovery and improve quality of life. The Company is currently conducting the design of the Website, the preparation of promotional events and related activities in order to operationalize the online services. During the last year, the Company completed the conceptual and technical design of the Website, which combines the classic theory of Hawthorne Effect, the function of artistic creation, and the technology and service of Internet in order to produce a unique service model through the multiple language virtual patients’ world PWORLD.net. The Company registered “www.PWORLD.net” as a pending trademark in international classes of 41 and 42. The LOGO design has also finished. On March 3, 2017, the Company purchased a high school in Buffalo, NY as the headquarter and events center of the Website. A Wellness Film Academy is under design based on the property. The building of the Website is going to be completed by May 10, 2017, the site technical support is Godaddy, located in Arizona. 94 US EXP GROUP INC. Notes to Financial Statements December 31, 2016 Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) February 18, 2017, the Wellness Film Festival, the Wellness Game Platform, and the Wellness Painting and Photography Exhibition and Auction (P Mall) all are in the preparation. We have a 20-member think tank in Buffalo, NY, including an economist, strategic consultant, business leadership lecturer, MBA, medical doctor, acupuncturist, pharmacologist, film studio director, film producer and film festival organizer, photographer, professional painter, professional writer, language scholar, professor in sociology, professor in communication, IT engineer and website builder, marketing expert, social activist, CPA, and corporate lawyer. Those members have worked together for 2-6 years. Our core members have organized an international patients’ team to endorse the Website. We are going to find some advertisers to support our events. The Company also is in the process of raising additional equity capital to support the completion of its development activities to provide the services as soon as possible. The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding to operationalize the website before another company develops similar business model. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists (sales agreements and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement); (ii) delivery of goods has occurred and risks and benefits of ownership have been transferred, which is when the goods are received by the customer at its designated location in accordance with the sales terms; (iii) the sales price is both fixed and determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Concentration During 2016, the Company was dependent on its CEO and principal shareholder to provide financing for operations. 95 US EXP GROUP INC. Notes to Financial Statements December 31, 2016 Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Advertising Advertising revenues are derived principally from online advertising and marketing, including display advertising and promoted marketing, and, to a lesser extent, sponsorship arrangements. The arrangements are evidenced by either online acceptance of terms and conditions or contracts that stipulate the types of advertising to be delivered, the timing and the pricing. Display advertising arrangements allow advertisers to place advertisements on particular areas of the Company’s websites or platform, in particular formats and over particular periods of time. Advertising revenues from display advertising arrangements are recognized ratably over the contract period of display, when the collectability is reasonably assured. The Company enters into cost per day (“CPD”) advertising arrangements with customers, under which the Company recognizes revenues ratably over the contract period. The Company also enters into cost per mille (“CPM”), or cost per thousand impressions, advertising arrangements with the customers, under which the Company recognizes revenues based on the number of times that the advertisement has been displayed. Promoted marketing arrangements are primarily priced based on CPM or cost per engagement (“CPE”). An engagement may include when a user clicks on a link, becomes a follower of the marketing customer account, shares the promoted feed or marks the feed as a favorite. Under the CPM model, customers are obligated to pay when the advertisement is displayed, while under the CPE model, customers are obligated to pay based on the number of engagements with the marketing feed. Sponsorship arrangements allow advertisers to sponsor a particular area on its websites in exchange for a fixed payment over the contract period. Advertising revenues from sponsorship are recognized ratably over the contract period. Advertising revenues derived from the design, coordination and integration of online advertising and sponsorship arrangements to be placed on the Company’s websites are recognized ratably over the term of such arrangements. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis. Payments and Other Fees We enable Payments from people to purchase physical, virtual and digital goods from our developers. People can transact and make payments on the Website by using debit cards and credit cards, PayPal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. 96 US EXP GROUP INC. Notes to Financial Statements December 31, 2016 Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) When a person engages in a payment transaction for the purchase of a physical, virtual or digital good from a seller, we remit to the seller an amount that is based on the total amount of the transaction less the processing fee that we charge the seller. The price of the purchase is an amount that is solely determined by the seller. Our revenue is the net amount of the transaction, representing our processing fee for the service performed. We record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the physical or virtual or digital good to the person. Additionally, we record all Payments revenue at the time of the purchase of the related virtual goods, net of estimated refunds or chargebacks. Other fees, which includes the delivery of virtual reality platform devices and related platform sales, and our ad serving and measurement products, were not material in all periods presented in our financial statements. Revenue is recognized net of applicable sales and other taxes. Cost of Revenue Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of intangible assets, costs associated with data partner arrangements, and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold. Income Taxes Under ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2016 there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration. 97 US EXP GROUP INC. Notes to Financial Statements December 31, 2016 Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The Company’s income tax expense differed from the statutory rates (federal 34% and state 6.5%) as follows: December 31, 2016 Expected tax expense (benefit) – Federal $ (1,588 ) Expected tax expense (benefit) – State (200 ) Change in valuation allowance 1,788 Provision for income taxes (benefit) $ — The net deferred income taxes in the accompanying balance sheet include the following amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities: Gross Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ (1,788 ) Total deferred tax assets 1,788 Less: valuation allowance (1,788 ) Net deferred tax asset recorded $ — As of December 31, 2016, the Company has a net operating loss carry forward of approximately $4,670 available to offset future taxable income through December 31, 2036. The valuation allowance was established to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. This is necessary due to the Company’s continued operating loss and the uncertainty of the Company’s ability to utilize all of the net operating loss carryforwards before they will expire through the year 2036. The net change in the valuation allowance for the period ended December 31, 2016 was an increase of $1,788. The company’s federal income tax returns for the period ended December 31, 2016 remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and State Tax Authorities through 2021. Loss Per Common Share Basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity. As of December 31, 2016, there are no outstanding dilutive securities. 98 US EXP GROUP INC. Notes to Financial Statements December 31, 2016 Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-Income Taxes. The Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative). The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is still in the process of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard. Management believes that the impact of this ASU to the Company’s financial statements would be insignificant. 99 US EXP GROUP INC. Notes to Financial Statements December 31, 2016 Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows”. The amendments provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: (1) Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs; (2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination; (4)Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned; (6) Life Insurance Policies; (7) Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees; (8) Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions; and Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other than Inventory”, which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-06 will be effective for the Company in its first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 on its consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, “Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control”. The amendments affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate a variable interest entity in certain situations involving entities under common control. Specifically, the amendments change the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. 100 US EXP GROUP INC. Notes to Financial Statements December 31, 2016 Note 2. Going Concern The Company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to date and has sustained operating loss of $4,670 during the period ended December 31, 2016. The Company had a working capital deficit of $2,607 and an accumulated deficit of $4,670 as of December 31, 2016. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources, as may be required. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. In order to maintain its current level of operations, the Company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from operations or from the sale of its equity. However, the Company currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase of its equity. If the Company is unable to acquire additional working capital, it will be required to significantly reduce its current level of operations. Note 3. Related Party Transactions Due from a related party amounted to $300 as of December 31, 2016. It represents amount due from a director for 3,000,000 shares of common stock issuance to the director at $0.0001 per share. The receivable was received on February 28, 2017.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions described above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than our payment of expenses incurred or paid by our director, officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. We have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our legal counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit the question of whether such indemnification is against public policy to a court of appropriate jurisdiction. We will then be governed by the court’s decision.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Our bylaws and articles of incorporation provide that our officers and directors are indemnified to the fullest extent provided by the Nevada Revised Statutes ("NRS"). Under the Nevada Revised Statutes, director immunity from liability to a company or its shareholders for monetary liabilities applies automatically unless it is specifically limited by a company's Articles of Incorporation. Our Articles of Incorporation do not specifically limit the directors' immunity. The NRS excepts from that immunity (a) a willful failure to deal fairly with the company or its shareholders in connection with a matter in which the director has a material conflict of interest; (b) a violation of criminal law, unless the director had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was lawful or no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful; (c) a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal profit; and (d) willful misconduct. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Company pursuant to the foregoing, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. The Company has not purchased insurance for the directors and officers which would provide coverage for their acts as an officer or director of the Company. Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities. On December 15, 2016, we sold 17,213.500 shares of our common stock to two (2) of our founders at $0.0001 per share.

These shares were sold on a private basis, no underwriter was involved in the sale and no commission were paid in connection with the sale. In March, 2017 the Company issued 1,400 shares of common stock for services provided. These shares were value at $5.00 per share. These shares were sold on a private basis, no underwriter was involved in the sale and no commissions were paid in connection with such sale. 108 In January, 2017 the Company issued 2,773,500 shares to 15 shareholders for $277.35. These shares were sold on a private basis, no underwriter was involved in the sale and no commissions were paid in connection with such sale.

Undertakings. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of the small business issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the small business issuer has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the small business issuer of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the small business issuer in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the small business issuer will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
