Our Market Opportunities Technological progress is driving a swift pace of change, resulting in ongoing societal transformation, complicated geopolitical dynamics, a shifting threat landscape and the globalization of commerce. To address this evolving landscape, our customers are actively seeking technology-enabled solutions to upgrade and transform assets and operations. The below trends are key drivers of activity and growth in both our Federal Solutions and Critical Infrastructure segments. Defense Spending Remains a Key Focus of the national agenda due to the reemergence of long-term strategic competition, which has been cited in the National Defense Strategy as the primary concern for U.S. national prosperity and security. This reemergence has resulted in increased global disorder and a security environment defined by rapid technological change, which may be more complex than ever before. Cybersecurity is Mission Critical to U.S. National Security and cybersecurity threats are increasing in volume and sophistication as global connectivity and the rise of social media have led to 5 Table of Contents an explosion in the amount of available and exploitable data. The proliferation of mobile devices, smart devices and cloud computing has vastly increased the need for enterprise-wide risk-based cybersecurity programs and governments have become increasingly aware of the need for a proactive approach to the risk of cyber-attacks. Consistent Need for Actionable Intelligence to Support U.S. Priorities is driving a shifting threat landscape that necessitates a greater need for collaboration and cooperation between intelligence agencies. There is a new demand for multi-domain command and control systems that are not designed for one particular warfighting domain, but are instead optimized to function cohesively across a spectrum of domains. This in turn drives a need for sophisticated data analytics to parse data into useful formats in real-time. Global Infrastructure Needs Significant Replacements and Technology-Driven Upgrades. Aging physical infrastructure is strained by the swift pace of technological change. Critical infrastructure, specifically transportation infrastructure that is essential to national economic and security concerns including airports, bridges, and rail and transit systems, is particularly vulnerable. We believe aging infrastructure will continue to be replaced and supplanted by newer, smarter infrastructure with an increased focus on connectivity. Urbanization Creates Demand for Smart Cities with Connected Populations. Cities around the globe increasingly demand new capabilities, such as sensor networks and communication strategies to connect streetlights, security cameras and emergency systems, to provide important real-time information and better serve their citizens. Better integrated corridor management solutions, intelligent transportation systems, advanced rail systems and updated telecommunication networks will keep cities around the world functioning as smart cities and serve as engines for economic growth. Disruption of Legacy Service Delivery Models from Technology. Historical capital project management is changing with the introduction of cloud-connected computer-aided design, automation, big data, machine learning and other technologies. The introduction of these new technologies allows industry participants to reimagine existing value chains, address integrated lifecycle objectives, boost productivity and streamline project management. Industry participants that have the capability to embrace these new technologies to enhance their capability and service offering to higher value solutions will be well positioned to assist governments and communities in their transformation. Amidst this disruption, we believe we are well-positioned to serve a large array of governments and companies. Across a diverse set of industries, we provide smart and agile solutions that address our customers concerns as they adapt to the rapid changes of a more interconnected and technology-driven world.

The ESOP is Parsons sole stockholder prior to the consummation of this offering. Upon completion of this offering, the shares beneficially owned by the ESOP will represent % of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock. The ESOP is a retirement plan and trust subject to the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA. The trustee of the ESOP is Newport Trust Company, which we refer to as the ESOP Trustee. Following consummation of this offering, each ESOP participant (or his or her beneficiaries) will have the right to direct the ESOP Trustee on how to vote the shares of common stock allocated to his or her account under the ESOP. The ESOP Trustee will vote any shares of common stock held in the ESOP, but not allocated to any ESOP participants account, and any allocated shares for which no voting directions are timely received by the ESOP Trustee. In addition, the ESOP Trustee has fiduciary duties under ERISA to the ESOP and its participants which may cause the ESOP Trustee to override participants voting directions. S Corporation Status Since 1999, we have elected to be taxed for U.S. federal income tax purposes as an S Corporation under the provisions of Sections 1361 through 1379 of the Code. As a result, our earnings have not been subject to, and we have not paid, U.S. federal income tax, and no provision or liability for U.S. federal income tax has been included in our consolidated financial statements. Instead, for U.S. federal income tax purposes our taxable income is passed through to our sole stockholder, the ESOP. As the ESOP is intended to be exempt from federal income taxes, we have not previously had to make any distributions to the ESOP for taxes. Unless specifically noted otherwise, no amount of our consolidated net income or our earnings per share presented in this prospectus, including in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes appearing in this prospectus, reflects any provision for or accrual of any expense for U.S. federal income tax liability for any period presented. In connection with this offering, our status as an S Corporation will terminate. Thereafter, our taxable earnings will be subject to U.S. federal income tax and we will bear the liability for those taxes. Basis of Presentation Prior to fiscal 2018, Parsons was on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Friday on or before the end of the calendar year. In 2018, our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from the last Friday on or before the calendar year to December 31st. Accordingly, references to fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 represent the financial results of Parsons Corporation and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, December 29, 2017, December 30, 2016, December 25, 2015 and December 26, 2014, respectively. In a 52-week fiscal year, each quarter contains 13 weeks of operations; in a 53-week fiscal year, three of the quarters include 13 weeks of operations and one of the quarters includes 14 weeks of operations. Fiscal 2017, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 were all 52-week years. Fiscal 2016 was a 53-week year, which may have caused our revenue, expenses and other results of operations to be higher due to an additional week of operations. 11 Table of Contents Trademarks, Trade Names and Service Marks Parsons, Polaris Alpha, iNET and Domain6 and our other registered or common law trademarks, service marks or trade names appearing in this prospectus are the property of Parsons Corporation.

Fiscal 2017 includes non-operating lease termination costs of $1.8 million, a $1.8 million loss related to disposed businesses, a $1.0 million loss from the sale of fixed assets and a $0.5 million loss related to several individually insignificant items that are non-recurring, 18 Table of Contents infrequent or unusual in nature. Fiscal 2018 includes a $0.6 million loss related to several individually insignificant items that are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual in nature. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our operating performance included in this prospectus because it is used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. We discuss Adjusted EBITDA because our management uses this measure for business planning purposes, including to manage the business against internal projected results of operations and measure the performance of the business generally. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP measure of our financial performance or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as measures of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Parsons Corporation, adjusted to include net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and to exclude interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These other items include, among other things, impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets, interest and other expenses recognized on litigation matters, amortization of deferred gain resulting from sale-leaseback transactions, expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and other non-recurring transaction costs and expenses related to our corporate restructuring initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for managements discretionary use, as it does not reflect tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future, including, among other things, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. The following table shows Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation for each of our reportable segments and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests: Fiscal Year Ended (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 30, 2016 December 29, 2017 December 31, 2018 Federal Solutions Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation $ 79,376 $ 89,269 $ 114,571 Critical Infrastructure Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation 81,206 86,471 97,779 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests 12,570 14,891 17,407 Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 173,152 $ 190,631 $ 229,757 19 Table of Contents See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSegment Results," and "Note 20Segments Information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for further discussion regarding our segment Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation. (2) Net Income Margin is calculated as net income (loss) including noncontrolling interests divided by revenue in the applicable period. (3) Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue in the applicable period. 20 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Relating to Our Business Government spending and priorities could change in a manner that adversely affects our future revenue and limits our growth prospects. We derive, and expect to continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenue from contracts with government entities. As a result, our business depends upon continued government expenditures on defense, intelligence, civil and engineering programs for which we provide support, both among foreign governments and at federal, state and local levels domestically. These expenditures have not remained constant over time and have been reduced in some periods. In particular, these expenditures have recently been affected by efforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs affecting government programs generally. Our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed, among other causes, by the following:  budgetary constraints, including mandated automatic spending cuts, affecting across-the-board government spending, or specific agencies in particular, and changes in available funding;  a shift in expenditures away from agencies or programs that we support;  reduced government outsourcing of functions that we are currently contracted to provide, including as a result of increased insourcing by various U.S. government agencies due to changes in the definition of inherently governmental work, including proposals to limit contractor access to sensitive or classified information and work assignments;  further efforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs affecting government programs;  changes or delays in government programs that we support or the programs requirements;  a continuation of recent efforts by the U.S. government in particular to decrease spending for management support service contracts;  U.S. government shutdowns due to, among other reasons, a failure by elected officials to fund the government, such as the shutdowns which occurred during government fiscal years 2019 and 2014 and, to a lesser extent, government fiscal year 2018, and other potential delays in the appropriations process;  U.S. government agencies awarding contracts on a technically acceptable/lowest cost basis in order to reduce expenditures;  delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices;  an inability by the U.S. government to fund its operations as a result of a failure to increase the federal governments debt ceiling, a credit downgrade of U.S. government obligations or for any other reason; and  changes in the political climate and general economic conditions, including a slowdown of the economy or unstable economic conditions and responses to conditions, such as emergency spending, that reduce funds available for other government priorities. 21 Table of Contents Any disruption in the functioning of government agencies, including as a result of government closures and shutdowns, terrorism, war, natural disasters, destruction of government facilities, and other potential calamities could have a negative impact on our operations and cause us to lose revenue or incur additional costs due to, among other things, our inability to deploy our staff to client locations or facilities as a result of such disruptions. In particular, with regard to our largest single customer, the U.S. federal government, budget deficits, the national debt and the prevailing economic condition, and actions taken to address them, could continue to negatively affect the U.S. government expenditures on defense, intelligence and civil programs for which we provide support. The Department of Defense is one of our significant clients and cost cutting, including through consolidation and elimination of duplicative organizations and insourcing, has become a major initiative for the Department of Defense. In particular, the Budget Control Act of 2011 provides for automatic spending cuts (referred to as sequestration) totaling approximately $1.2 trillion between 2013 and 2021, including an estimated $500.0 billion in federal defense spending cuts over this time period. Most recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the discretionary spending limits established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 for the government fiscal 2018 and 2019 budgets across the federal government and increased the prior discretionary spending cap in both defense and non-defense. Pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, the new Department of Defense spending limit is approximately $660.0 billion for government fiscal 2018, including an allocation of $65.0 billion in overseas contingency operations funding. While recent budget actions reflect a more measured and strategic approach to addressing the U.S. governments fiscal challenges, there remains uncertainty as to how exactly budget cuts, including sequestration, will impact us, and we are therefore unable to predict the extent of the impact of such cuts on our business and results of operations. However, a reduction in the amount of or delays or cancellations of funding for, services that we are contracted to provide to the Department of Defense as a result of any of these initiatives, legislation or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in response to an Office of Management and Budget mandate, government agencies have reduced management support services spending in recent years. If federal awards for management support services continue to decline, our revenue and operating profits may materially decline and further efforts by the Office of Management and Budget to decrease federal awards for management support services could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, most government contracts are subject to the governments budgetary approval process. Legislatures typically appropriate funds for a given program on a year-by-year basis, even though contract performance may take more than one year. In addition, public-supported financing such as state and local municipal bonds may be only partially raised to support existing infrastructure projects. As a result, at the beginning of a program, the related contract is only partially funded, and additional funding is normally committed only as appropriations are made in each fiscal year. These appropriations, and the timing of payment of appropriated amounts, may be influenced by, among other things, the state of the economy, competing priorities for appropriation, changes in administration or control of legislatures and the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures. Similarly, the impact of an economic downturn on state and local governments may make it more difficult for them to fund infrastructure projects. If appropriations are not made in subsequent years on our government contracts, then we will not realize all of our potential revenue and profit from that contract, and we may incur substantial labor costs without reimbursement. Government funding with respect to our Critical Infrastructure services fluctuates over time and new or changing government policies may affect our Critical Infrastructure business and operations. In March 2018, for example, President Trump signed proclamations to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports per the U.S. Trade Expansion Act of 1962 increasing the price for steel and aluminum in the United States which could impact client spending. Government spending for our 22 Table of Contents Critical Infrastructure services may also depend on factors related to government demand, such as the condition of the existing infrastructure and buildings and the need for new or expanded infrastructure and buildings. Our government clients may face budget cuts or deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing Critical Infrastructure projects. These or other factors could cause our defense, intelligence, infrastructure or civil clients to decrease the number of new government contracts awarded generally and fail to award us new government contracts, reduce their purchases under our existing government contracts, exercise their right to terminate our government contracts or not exercise options to renew our government contracts, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. federal government and its agencies collectively are our largest single customer and, if our reputation or relationships with the U.S. federal government were harmed, our future revenues and cash flows would be adversely affected. The U.S. federal government and its agencies, including the military and intelligence community, collectively are our largest customer. In particular, it represents substantially all of the revenue of our Federal Solutions segment. Approximately 35%, 36% and 42% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and approximately 25% and 29% of accounts receivable as of December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively, were derived from contracts with the U.S. federal government and its agencies. Our reputation and relationships with various U.S. government entities and agencies, and in particular with the U.S. Department of Defense, including the Missile Defense Agency and the United States Army, the Federal Aviation Administration, the United States intelligence community and the U.S. Department of Energy are key factors in maintaining and growing these revenues and winning new bids for new business. Negative press reports or publicity, regardless of accuracy, could harm our reputation. If our reputation or relationships with government agencies were to be negatively affected, or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason, the amount of business with government and other customers would decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our being liable for penalties, including termination of our government contracts, disqualification from bidding on future government contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting. We must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of government contracts, which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. Many of our U.S. government contracts contain organizational conflict of interest, or OCI, clauses that may limit our ability to compete for or perform contracts or other types of services for particular customers. OCI arises when we engage in activities that may make us unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the U.S. government, impair our objectivity in performing contract work or provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. Existing OCI, and any OCI that may develop, could preclude our competition for or performance on a significant project or contract, which could limit our opportunities. Some U.S. federal and state statutes and regulations provide for automatic debarment based on our actions, such as violations of the U.S. False Claims Act or the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA. The suspension or debarment in any particular case may be limited to the facility, contract or 23 Table of Contents subsidiary involved in the violation or could be applied to our entire enterprise in severe circumstances. Even a narrow scope suspension or debarment could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our ability to renew contracts and to secure new contracts, both with governments and private customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Governments may adopt new contract rules and regulations or revise their procurement practices in a manner adverse to us at any time. The government-related industries within which we do business continue to experience significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability, efficiencies and recovery of costs, among other items. Our existing and potential clients are similarly focused on increasing the productivity of their contractual arrangements. Moreover, government agencies may face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and amount of services that they may obtain from private contractors. Legislation, regulations and initiatives dealing with procurement reform, mitigation of potential OCIs, deterrence of fraud, and environmental responsibility or sustainability could have an adverse effect on us. Moreover, shifts in the buying practices of government agencies, such as increased usage of fixed price contracts, multiple award contracts and small business set-aside contracts, could have adverse effects on government contractors, including us. Any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or contract renewals. Any new contracting requirements or procurement methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A substantial portion of our business is subject to reviews, audits and cost adjustments by government agencies, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could adversely affect our profitability, cash flows or growth prospects. Government agencies routinely audit and review a contractors performance on government contracts, indirect cost rates and pricing practices, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. They also review the adequacy of the contractors compliance with government standards for its business systems, which are defined as the contractors accounting, earned value management, estimating, materials management, property management and purchasing systems. A finding of significant control deficiencies in a contractors business systems or a finding of noncompliance with U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards, or CAS, can result in decremented billing rates to U.S. government customers until the control deficiencies are corrected and their remediation is accepted by the Defense Contract Management Agency. The agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny. As a result, audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which we are held are being more strictly interpreted which has increased the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome. If a review or investigation by a government agency identifies improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions which could include the termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, the triggering of price reduction clauses, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies. We may suffer harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety are made against us, which would impair our ability to win new contract awards or receive contract renewals. Penalties and sanctions are not uncommon in our industries. If we incur a material penalty or administrative sanction or otherwise suffer harm to our reputation, our profitability, cash position and future prospects could be adversely affected. Government audits and reviews may conclude that our practices are not consistent with applicable laws and regulations and result in adjustments to contract costs and mandatory customer 24 Table of Contents refunds. Such adjustments can be applied retroactively, which could result in significant customer refunds, and those refunds would negatively impact our revenue. Receipt of adverse audit findings or the failure to obtain an approved determination on our various business systems could significantly and adversely affect our business by, among other things, restricting our ability to bid on new contracts and, for those proposals under evaluation, diminishing our competitive position. A determination of noncompliance could also result in penalties and sanctions against us, including withholding of payments, suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny. Increased scrutiny could adversely impact our ability to perform on contracts, affect our ability to invoice for work performed, delay the receipt of timely payment on contracts, and weaken our ability to compete for new contracts with the government. Our government contracts may be terminated by the government counterparty at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government to discontinue contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Government contracts often contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide government clients with rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts. These rights and remedies allow government clients, among other things, to:  terminate existing contracts, with short notice, for convenience as well as for default;  reduce orders under or otherwise modify contracts;  for contracts subject to the Truth in Negotiations Act, reduce the contract price or cost where it was increased because a contractor or subcontractor furnished cost or pricing data during negotiations that was not complete, accurate and current;  for some contracts, (1) demand a refund, make a forward price adjustment or terminate a contract for default if a contractor provided inaccurate or incomplete data during the contract negotiation process and (2) reduce the contract price under triggering circumstances, including the revision of price lists or other documents upon which the contract award was predicated;  terminate our facility security clearances and thereby prevent us from receiving classified contracts;  cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;  decline to exercise an option to renew a multi-year contract or issue task orders in connection with indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts, or IDIQ contracts;  claim rights in solutions, systems and technology produced by us, appropriate such work-product for their continued use without continuing to contract for our services and disclose such work-product to third parties, including other government agencies and our competitors, which could harm our competitive position;  prohibit future procurement awards with a particular agency due to a finding of organizational conflicts of interest based upon prior related work performed for the agency that would give a contractor an unfair advantage over competing contractors, or the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a contractors judgment;  subject the award of contracts to protest by competitors, which may require the contracting federal agency or department to suspend our performance pending the outcome of the protest and may also result in a requirement to resubmit offers for the contract or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract; 25 Table of Contents  suspend or debar us from doing business with the applicable government; and  control or prohibit the export of our services. Recent and potential future budget cuts, the impact of sequestration and recent efforts by the Office of Management and Budget to decrease federal awards for management support services, may cause agencies with which we currently have contracts to terminate, reduce the number of task orders under or fail to renew such contracts. If a government client were to unexpectedly terminate, cancel, or decline to exercise an option to renew with respect to one or more of our significant contracts, or suspend or debar us from doing business with such government, our revenue and operating results would be materially harmed. We face aggressive competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and may affect our future revenues, profitability and growth prospects. We expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process. For example, the U.S. government increasingly relies on IDIQ, GSA Schedule and other multi-award contracts, which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. The competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks, including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us, or that may be awarded but for which we do not receive meaningful task orders. For contracts awarded to us, we also face the risk of inaccurately estimating the resources and costs that will be required to fulfill any contract we win. Following contract award, we may encounter significant expense, delay, contract modifications or even contract loss as a result of our competitors protesting the award of contracts to us in competitive bidding. Any resulting loss or delay of startup and funding of work under protested contract awards may adversely affect our revenues and/or profitability. In addition, multi-award contracts require that we make sustained post-award efforts to obtain task orders under the contract. As a result, we may not be able to obtain these task orders or recognize revenues under these multi award contracts. Our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Projects may be awarded based solely upon price, but often take into account other factors, such as technical qualifications, proposed project team, schedule and past performance on similar projects. We compete with larger companies that have greater name recognition, financial resources and larger technical staffs and with smaller, more specialized companies that are able to concentrate their resources on particular areas. Additionally, we may compete with a governments own capabilities. Technology-focused companies may also develop products and services that could disrupt our business or compete with our services. To remain competitive, we must consistently provide superior service, technology and performance on a cost-effective basis to our customers and there is no assurance that we will do so. Our revenue and growth prospects may be harmed if we or our employees are unable to obtain government granted eligibility or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our customers. A number of government programs require contractors to have certain kinds of government granted eligibility, such as security clearance credentials. Depending on the project, eligibility can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary eligibility, including local ownership requirements, we may not be able to win new business, and our existing customers could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derive the revenue or profit anticipated from such contract. 26 Table of Contents A failure to attract, train and retain skilled employees and our senior management team would adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and may disrupt our operations. Our business relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Our continued success depends on our ability to recruit and retain highly trained and skilled engineering, technical and professional personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is intense and competitors aggressively recruit key employees. In addition, many U.S. government programs require contractors to have security clearances. Depending on the level of required clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain and personnel with security clearances are in great demand. Particularly in highly specialized areas, it has become more difficult to retain employees and meet all of our needs for employees in a timely manner, which may affect our growth in the current and future fiscal years. Although we intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruiting, training and retaining qualified employees, we may not be able to attract, effectively train and retain these employees. Any failure to do so could impair our ability to efficiently perform our contractual obligations, timely meet our customers needs and ultimately win new business, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We believe that our success also depends on the continued employment of a highly qualified and experienced senior management team and that teams ability to retain existing business and generate new business. The loss of key personnel in critical functions could lead to lack of business continuity or disruptions in our business until we are able to hire and train replacement personnel. Our profitability could suffer if we are not able to timely and effectively utilize our employees or manage our cost structure. The cost of providing our services, including the degree to which our employees are utilized, affects our profitability. The degree to which we are able to utilize our employees in a timely manner or at all is affected by a number of factors, including:  our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments and to hire, assimilate and deploy new employees;  our ability to forecast demand for our services and to maintain and deploy headcount that is aligned with demand, including employees with the right mix of skills and experience to support our projects;  our employees inability to obtain or retain necessary security clearances or required certifications;  changes to or delays or cancellations of projects, as a result of governmental budgetary processes or otherwise;  our ability to manage attrition; and  our need to devote time and resources to training, business development, and other non-chargeable activities. If our employees are under-utilized, our profit margin and profitability could suffer. Additionally, if our employees are over-utilized, it could have a material adverse effect on employee morale and attrition, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our profitability is also affected by the extent to which we are able to effectively manage our overall cost structure for operating expenses, such as wages and benefits, real estate expenses, overhead and capital and other investment-related expenditures. If we are unable to effectively manage our costs and expenses and achieve efficiencies, our competitiveness and profitability may be adversely affected. 27 Table of Contents Our focus on new growth areas for our business entails risks, including those associated with new relationships, clients, talent needs, capabilities, service offerings and maintaining our collaborative culture and core values. We are focused on growing our presence in our addressable markets by enhancing and optimizing our core operations, extending into opportunity-rich adjacent markets and acquiring and integrating transformative, disruptive technologies. These efforts entail inherent risks associated with innovation and competition from other participants in those areas, potential failure to help our clients respond to the challenges they face, our ability to comply with uncertain evolving legal standards applicable to some of our service offerings, including those in the cybersecurity area, and, with respect to potential international growth, risks associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions, such as compliance with applicable foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that may impose different and, occasionally, conflicting or contradictory requirements, and the economic, legal, and political conditions in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, as described in additional detail below. As we attempt to develop new relationships, clients, capabilities, and service offerings, these efforts could harm our results of operations due to, among other things, a diversion of our focus and resources and actual costs, opportunity costs of pursuing these opportunities in lieu of others and a failure to reach a profitable return on our investments in new technologies, capabilities, and businesses, including expenses on research and development investments, and these efforts could ultimately be unsuccessful. Additionally, the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new capabilities or service offerings that might cause our existing capabilities and service offerings to become obsolete. If we fail in our new capabilities development efforts or our capabilities or services fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors, our ability to procure new contracts could be negatively impacted, which would negatively impact our results of operations and our financial condition. In addition, our ability to grow our business by leveraging our operating model to efficiently and effectively deploy our people across our client base is largely dependent on our ability to maintain our collaborative culture. To the extent that we are unable to maintain our culture for any reason, including our effort to focus on new growth areas or acquire new businesses with different corporate cultures, we may be unable to grow our business. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. With the growth of our U.S. and international operations, we are now providing client services and undertaking business development efforts in numerous and disparate geographic locations both domestically and internationally. Our ability to effectively serve our clients is dependent upon our ability to successfully leverage our operating model across all of these and any future locations, maintain effective management controls over all of our locations to ensure, among other things, compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, and instill our core values in all of our personnel at each of these and any future locations. Any inability to ensure any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 28 Table of Contents We may make acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and divestitures in the future that involve numerous risks, which if realized, may adversely affect our business and our future results. We may make strategic acquisitions, engage in joint ventures or divest existing businesses, which could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and have disruptive effects on our business and may not yield the benefits we expect. Our Credit Agreement imposes limitations on our ability to make other acquisitions. Subject to those limitations, we may selectively pursue additional strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures in the future. Any future acquisitions, investments and joint ventures may pose many risks that could adversely affect our reputation, operations or financial results, including:  we may not retain key employees (including those with needed security clearances), customers and business partners of an acquired business in the future;  we may fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses, such as failing to successfully integrate information technology and other control systems relating to the operations of any acquired business;  acquisitions normally require a significant investment of time and resources, which may disrupt our business and distract our management from other important responsibilities;  we may not be able to accurately estimate the financial effect of any acquisitions and investments on our business and we may not realize anticipated revenue opportunities, cost savings, or other synergies or benefits, or acquisitions may not result in improved operating performance; and  we may assume known as well as unknown material liabilities, legal or regulatory risks that were not identified as part of our due diligence or for which we are unable to receive a purchase price adjustment or reimbursement through indemnification. If any acquisitions, investments or joint ventures fail, perform poorly or their value is otherwise impaired for any reason, including contractions in credit markets and global economic conditions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we may periodically divest or plan to divest businesses, including businesses that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan. These divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources and may disrupt our business, distract management from other responsibilities and may result in losses on disposal or continued financial involvement in the divested business, including through indemnification, guarantee or other financial arrangements, for a period of time following the transaction, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. When we determine that we would like to divest a business, we may not be able to divest that business on attractive terms or at all. We conduct a portion of our work through joint venture entities, some of which we do not have management control over, and with which we typically have joint and several liability with our joint venture partners. 12.6% of our revenue during fiscal 2016, 14.8% of our revenue during fiscal 2017 and 15.2% of our revenue during fiscal 2018 was derived from our operations through consolidated joint ventures. In addition, 4.2% of our revenues in fiscal 2016, 3.7% of our revenues in fiscal 2017 and 4.1% of our revenues in fiscal 2018 related to services we provided to our unconsolidated joint ventures, where control resides with unaffiliated third parties, and 100.2% of our operating income during fiscal 2016, 26.6% of our operating income during fiscal 2017 and 18.0% of our operating income during fiscal 2018 was derived from equity in our unconsolidated joint ventures. As with most joint venture 29 Table of Contents arrangements, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or disputes. We also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners and we typically have joint and several liability with our joint venture partners under the applicable contracts for joint venture projects. These factors could potentially adversely impact the business and operations of a joint venture and, in turn, our business and operations. Operating through joint ventures in which we are a minority holder results in us having limited control over many decisions made with respect to projects and internal controls relating to projects. We generally do not have control of these unconsolidated joint ventures. These joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. As a result, internal control problems may arise with respect to these joint ventures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could also affect our reputation in the industries we serve. We participate in joint ventures where we provide guarantees and may be adversely impacted by the failure of such joint venture or its participants to fulfill their obligations. We have investments in and commitments to joint ventures with unrelated parties. These joint ventures from time to time may borrow money to help finance their activities and in some circumstances, we may be required to provide guarantees of the obligations of our affiliated entities. At December 31, 2018, we had $76.8 million of letters of credit and guarantees that relate to joint ventures. If these entities are not able to honor their obligations under the guarantees, we may be required to expend additional resources or suffer losses, which could be significant. The Polaris Acquisition and OGSystems Acquisition may not achieve their full intended benefits or may disrupt our plans and operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate Polaris Alpha and OGSystems with our business or otherwise realize the expected benefits of our acquisition of Polaris Alpha on May 31, 2018, which we refer to as the Polaris Acquisition, and our acquisition of OGSystems, on January 7, 2019, which we refer to as the OGSystems Acquisition. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Polaris Acquisition and OGSystems Acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Polaris Alpha and OGSystems with our business. The combination of multiple independent businesses will be a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. Our business may be negatively impacted following the Polaris Acquisition and OGSystems Acquisition if we are unable to effectively manage our expanded operations. The integration process will require significant time and focus from our management team and may divert attention from the day-to-day operations of the combined business. Additionally, consummation of the Polaris Acquisition and OGSystems Acquisition could disrupt our current plans and operations, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. The expected synergies and operating efficiencies of each of the Polaris Acquisition and OGSystems Acquisition may not be fully realized, which could result in increased costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships and diversion of managements attention, among other potential adverse consequences. The risks of combining our operations of the businesses include, among others:  we may have underestimated the costs to integrate Polaris Alphas and OGSystems information systems with ours;  we may face difficulties in integrating Polaris Alphas and OGSystems employees, integrating different corporate cultures and in attracting and retaining key personnel; and 30 Table of Contents  we may face challenges in keeping existing Polaris Alpha and OGSystems contracts and customers. Many of these risks will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenue, and diversion of our managements time and energy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if our operations are integrated successfully with Polaris Alphas and OGSystems, we may not realize the full benefits of the Polaris Acquisition and OGSystems Acquisition, including the synergies, operating efficiencies, or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Our earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to accurately estimate and manage costs, time and resources. We generate revenue under various types of contracts, which include time-and-materials, cost-plus and fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract, the nature of services or solutions provided, as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined. Cost-plus and time-and-materials contracts generally have lower profitability than fixed-price contracts. To varying degrees, each of our contract types involves some risk that we could underestimate the costs and resources necessary to fulfill the contract. Our profitability is adversely affected when we incur costs on cost-plus and time-and-materials contracts that we cannot bill to our customers. While fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns. Revenue derived from fixed-price contracts represented 33% of our total revenue during fiscal 2016, 35% of our total revenue during fiscal 2017 and 32% of our total revenue during fiscal 2018. When making proposals on fixed-price contracts, we rely heavily on our estimates of costs, scope and timing for completing the associated projects, as well as assumptions regarding technical issues. In particular, contracts in our Critical Infrastructure segment are often won in a hard bid process, in which clients primarily select the lowest qualified bidder with the understanding that they will not pay above the bid amount, even if we perform work beyond the initial scope of our contract. In each case, our failure to accurately estimate costs, scope or the resources and technology needed to perform our contracts or to effectively manage and control our costs during the performance of work could result, and in some instances has resulted, in reduced profits or in losses. More generally, any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of our contracts, including costs and delays caused by contractual disputes or other factors outside of our control, such as performance failures of our subcontractors, natural disasters or other force majeure events, could make our contracts less profitable than expected or unprofitable. We use estimates in recognizing revenues and, if we make changes to estimates used in recognizing revenues, our profitability may be adversely affected. A significant portion of our contract revenues are recognized using the cost-to-cost measure of progress method. This method requires estimates of total costs at completion or measurement of progress towards completion. Particularly due to the technical nature of the services being performed and the length of the contracts, this estimation process is complex and involves significant judgment. Adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses, experience is gained and additional information becomes known, even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change. Any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized immediately. Changes in the underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that 31 Table of Contents may adversely affect our financial results of operations. For example, we recognized net operating income decreases related to changes in estimates at contract completion of $22.4 million in fiscal 2016, $23.8 million in fiscal 2017 and $2.3 million in fiscal 2018. We have submitted claims to clients for work we performed beyond the initial scope of some of our contracts. If these clients do not approve these claims, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. We typically have pending claims submitted under some of our contracts for payment of work performed beyond the initial contractual requirements for which we have already recorded revenue. In general, we cannot guarantee that such claims will be approved in whole, in part, or at all. Often, these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we have used working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. If these claims are not approved, our revenue may be reduced in future periods. As of December 31, 2018, we had recorded $45.7 million of unresolved pending claims on our balance sheet. Systems that we develop, integrate, maintain, or otherwise support could experience security breaches which may damage our reputation with our clients and hinder future contract win rates. We develop, integrate, maintain, or otherwise support systems and provide services that include managing and protecting information involved in intelligence, national security and other sensitive or classified government functions. Our systems also store and process sensitive information for commercial clients. The cyber and security threats that our clients face have grown more frequent and sophisticated. A security breach in one of these systems could cause serious harm to our business, damage our reputation, and prevent us from being eligible for further work on sensitive systems for government or commercial clients. Work for non-government and commercial clients involving the protection of information systems or that store clients information could also be harmed due to associated security breaches. Damage to our reputation or limitations on our eligibility for additional work or any liability resulting from a security breach in one of the systems we develop, install, maintain, or otherwise support could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Services we provide and technologies we develop are designed to detect and monitor threats to our clients, the failure of which may lead to reputational harm or liability against us by our clients or third parties and may subject our staff to potential threats, risk of loss or harm. We help our clients detect, monitor and mitigate threats to their people, information and facilities. These threats may originate from nation states, terrorist or criminal actors, activist hackers or others who seek to harm our clients. There are many factors, some of which are beyond our control, which could result in the failure of our products to detect, monitor or mitigate these threats. Successful attacks on our clients may cause physical or reputational harm to us and our clients, as well as lead to liability claims against us by our clients or third parties, particularly if such attacks are a result of a failure or perceived failure of our services or technologies. In addition, as a result of our involvement with some clients or projects, our staff, information and facilities may be targeted by these or other threat actors and may be at risk for loss, or physical or reputational harm. 32 Table of Contents Internal system or service failures affecting us or our vendors, including as a result of cyber or other security threats, could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services to our clients, which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We create, implement, and maintain information technology and engineering systems and also use vendors to provide services that are often critical to our clients operations, some of which involve sensitive information and may be conducted in war zones or other hazardous environments, or include information whose confidentiality is protected by law. As a result, we may be subject to systems or service failures, not only resulting from our own failures or the failures of third-party service providers, natural disasters, power shortages, or terrorist attacks, but also from continuous exposure to cyber and other security threats, including computer viruses and malware, attacks by computer hackers or physical break-ins. There has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of the cyber and security threats we face, with attacks ranging from those common to businesses generally to those that are more advanced and persistent, which may target us because, as a cybersecurity services contractor, we hold classified, controlled unclassified and other sensitive information. As a result, we and our vendors face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption resulting from an attack by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists. While we put in place policies, controls and technologies to help detect and protect against such attacks, we cannot guarantee that future incidents will not occur, and if an incident does occur, we may not be able to successfully mitigate the impact. We have been the target of these types of attacks in the past and future attacks are likely to occur. If successful, these types of attacks on our network or other systems or service failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, due to, among other things, the loss of client or proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our clients businesses and damage to our reputation. In addition, the failure or disruption of our systems, communications, vendors, or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if our employees inadvertently do not adhere to appropriate information security protocols, our protocols are inadequate, or our employees intentionally avoid these protocols, our or our clients sensitive information may be released thereby causing significant negative impacts to our reputation and exposing us or our clients to liability. If our or our vendors systems, services or other applications have significant defects or errors, are successfully attacked by cyber and other security threats, suffer delivery delays or otherwise fail to meet our clients expectations, we may:  lose revenue due to adverse client reaction;  be required to provide additional services to a client at no charge;  incur additional costs related to remediation, monitoring and increasing our cybersecurity;  lose revenue due to the deployment of internal staff for remediation efforts instead of client assignments;  receive negative publicity, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients;  be unable to successfully market services that are reliant on the creation and maintaining of secure information technology systems to government and commercial clients;  suffer claims by clients or impacted third parties for substantial damages, particularly as a result of any successful network or systems breach and exfiltration of client and/or third party information; or 33 Table of Contents  incur significant costs, including fines from government regulators related to complying with applicable federal or state law, including laws pertaining to the security and protection of personal information. In addition to any costs resulting from contract performance or required corrective action, these failures may result in increased costs or loss of revenue if they result in clients postponing subsequently scheduled work or canceling or failing to renew contracts. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Additionally, some cyber technologies and techniques that we utilize or develop may raise potential liabilities related to legal compliance, intellectual property and civil liberties, including privacy concerns, which may not be fully insured or indemnified. We may not be able to obtain and maintain insurance coverage on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or the insurer may disclaim coverage as to some types of future claims. The successful assertion of any large claim against us could seriously harm our business. Even if not successful, these claims could result in significant legal and other costs, may be a distraction to our management, and may harm our client relationships. In some new business areas, we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance and may decide not to accept or solicit business in these areas. As a contractor supporting defense and national security clients, we are also subject to regulatory compliance requirements under the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and other federal regulations requiring that our networks and information technology systems comply with the security and privacy controls in National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publications. To the extent that we do not comply with the applicable security and control requirements, whether imposed by regulation or contract, unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information could potentially result in a contract termination that has a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reputational harm. Unavailability or cancellation of third-party insurance coverage would increase our overall risk exposure as well as disrupt the management of our business operations. We maintain insurance coverage from third-party insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits. If any of our third-party insurers fail, suddenly cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage, then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations would be disrupted. In addition, there can be no assurance that any of our existing insurance coverage will be renewable upon the expiration of the coverage period or that future coverage will be affordable at the required limits. Adverse judgments or settlements in legal disputes could result in materially adverse monetary damages or injunctive relief and damage our reputation. We are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. For example, our performance under U.S. government contracts and compliance with the terms of those contracts and applicable laws and regulations are subject to continuous audit, review, and investigation by the U.S. government which may include such investigative techniques as subpoenas or civil investigative demands. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings, including the claims described under BusinessLegal Proceedings, are inherently uncertain and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. For example, in fiscal 2014, we recorded a loss of approximately $100.0 million when 34 Table of Contents a California state court entered judgment against us in connection with a claim by the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority, or the MTA Lawsuit, against a joint venture in which we were the managing partner, which we refer to as the MTA Judgment. We successfully appealed this judgment and, in 2018, the judgment was vacated. Additionally, our insurance policies may not protect us against potential liability due to various exclusions in the policies and self-insured retention amounts. Partially or completely uninsured claims, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements and any violation of these requirements or any misconduct by our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could harm our business and reputation. In addition to government contract procurement laws and regulations, we are subject to numerous other federal, state and foreign legal requirements on matters as diverse as data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations, immigration, taxation, anti-corruption, import/export controls, trade restrictions, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation and anti-competition. Compliance with diverse and changing legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to compete for work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations. Misconduct by our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could subject us to fines and penalties, restitution or other damages, loss of security clearance, loss of current and future customer contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with federal, state or local government agencies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such misconduct could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records, failure to comply with our policies and procedures or violations of applicable laws and regulations. Goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant amount of our total assets and any impairment of these assets would negatively impact our results of operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had goodwill and intangible assets of $916.5 million. In fiscal 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $84.7 million associated with goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our restructuring activities in 2015 and 2016. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more often if indicators of potential impairment exist, and intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable could include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key contracts, customer relationships, or personnel that affect current and future operating cash flows of the reporting unit. Any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would have a negative impact on our profitability and financial results. 35 Table of Contents We depend on our teaming arrangements and relationships with other contractors and subcontractors. If we are not able to maintain these relationships, or if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or the customer, our revenues, profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected. We rely on teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors in order to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services, products and solutions provided by us and our teammates will help us to win and perform the contract. Our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their contract relationships with us, or if our government clients terminate or reduce these other contractors programs, do not award them new contracts or refuse to pay under a contract. Companies that do not have access to government contracts or experience with our customers may perform services as our subcontractor that we cannot otherwise provide ourselves, and that exposure could enhance such companies prospect of securing a future position as a prime government contractor which could increase competition for future contracts and impair our ability to win these contracts. Whenever our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations, have regulatory compliance or other problems, our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor may be jeopardized. Subcontractor performance deficiencies under subcontracts with us as the prime contractor could lead to significant losses in future periods and could result in our termination for default as the prime contractor even though it was the subcontractor that failed to perform and not our personnel. Our failure to meet contractual schedule requirements, meet a required performance standard, meet our internal contractual performance projections or otherwise perform adequately on a project could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Under some of our contracts, we can incur liquidated or other damages if we do not achieve project completion by a scheduled date. In addition, our costs generally increase from schedule delays and/or could exceed our projections for a particular project. Project performance can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including unavoidable delays from governmental inaction, public opposition, inability to obtain financing, weather conditions, unavailability of vendor materials, changes in the project scope of services requested by our clients, industrial accidents, environmental hazards, labor disruptions and other factors. Any defects or errors, or failures to meet our clients expectations, in our projects or services could result in claims for damages against us and could adversely affect our reputation. Material performance problems for existing and future contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ from those anticipated by us and also could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within our industries and client base. Many of our contracts require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We design and develop technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by our customers in a variety of environments. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements. Our offerings cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability such as problems with governmental inaction, quality and workmanship, delivery of subcontractor components or services, unplanned degradation of product performance, unavailability of vendor materials and changes in the project 36 Table of Contents scope requested by our clients. Among the factors that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer, diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems, loss of follow-on work, damage to our reputation and repayment to the customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received. Failure to adequately protect, maintain, or enforce our rights in our intellectual property may adversely limit our competitive position. We rely upon a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements, as well as copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary information. We also enter into proprietary information and intellectual property agreements with employees, which require them to disclose any inventions created during employment, to convey such rights to inventions to us, and to restrict any disclosure of proprietary information. Trade secrets are generally difficult to protect. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information and/or the infringement of our patents and copyrights. Further, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. Failure to adequately protect, maintain, or enforce our intellectual property rights may adversely limit our competitive position. Assertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition and operation results. In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in technology industries. We may face from time to time, allegations that we or a supplier or customer have violated the rights of third parties, including patent, trademark, and other intellectual property rights. If, with respect to any claim against us for violation of third-party intellectual property rights, we are unable to prevail in the litigation or retain or obtain sufficient rights or develop non-infringing intellectual property or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely or cost-efficient basis, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. Any infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious, are time consuming, divert technical and management personnel, and are costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease utilizing products or services, or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. Our operations outside the United States expose us to legal, political and economic risks in different countries as well as currency exchange rate fluctuations that could harm our business and financial results. Revenue attributable to our services provided outside of the United States as a percentage of our total revenue was 29.7% in fiscal 2016, 30.0% in fiscal 2017 and 29.8% in fiscal 2018. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:  imposition of governmental controls and changes in laws, regulations or policies;  political and economic instability, such as in the Middle East;  civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war, or other armed conflict;  greater physical security risks; 37 Table of Contents  changes in U.S. and other national government trade policies affecting the markets for our services;  changes in regulatory practices, tariffs and taxes;  potential non-compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, U.S. export controls and economic and trade sanctions, and anti-boycott laws and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations;  changes in labor conditions;  logistical and communication challenges; and  currency exchange rate fluctuations, devaluations and other conversion restrictions. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have operations in the Middle East and neighboring regions, and these regions may experience turmoil that may impact our current projects, future business and financial stability. We currently have operations in the Middle East, including in Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. These countries experience frequent political turmoil such as the tensions among Qatar and several of its neighbors, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. This uncertainty may affect our ability to continue our projects in these regions due to lack of resources, local support, and safety for our workers. If we are unable to finish these projects, it is likely that our finances will be impacted. Furthermore, we may experience liability regarding our employees and their safety and security in these locations. We also may incur material costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. Despite these precautions, the safety of our personnel in these locations may continue to be at risk. Acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel, cancellation of contracts, or the loss of key employees, contractors or assets. We operate in many different jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws. The FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls which may fall within the purview of the FCPA, its books and records provisions or its anti-bribery provisions. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree; and, in some circumstances, strict compliance with anticorruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot assure that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. In addition, from time to time, government investigations of corruption in industries we operate in may affect us and our peers. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may not realize the full value of our backlog, which may result in lower than expected revenue. As of December 31, 2018, our total backlog was $8.0 billion, of which $5.3 billion was funded. We historically have not realized all of the revenue included in our total backlog, and we may not realize all 38 Table of Contents of the revenue included in our total backlog in the future. There is a somewhat higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to unfunded backlog and backlog related to unexercised options years and IDIQ contracts for which delivery orders have not yet been issued. In addition, there can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period. This is because the actual receipt, timing and amount of revenue under contracts included in backlog are subject to various contingencies, including congressional appropriations, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, delays in the completion of the U.S. governments budgeting process and the use of continuing resolutions could adversely affect our ability to timely recognize revenue under our contracts included in backlog. Furthermore, the actual receipt of revenue from contracts included in backlog may never occur or may be delayed because: a program schedule could change or the program could be canceled; a contracts funding or scope could be reduced, modified, delayed or terminated early, including as a result of a lack of appropriated funds or as a result of cost cutting initiatives and other efforts to reduce government spending; in the case of funded backlog, the period of performance for the contract has expired; in the case of unfunded backlog, funding may not be available; in the case of backlog related to unexercised option years, the contract option is not yet exercised or may ever be exercised; and, in the case of backlog related to IDIQ contracts where delivery orders have not been issued, no further delivery orders may be issued. In addition, headcount growth is the primary means by which we are able to achieve revenue growth. Any inability to hire additional appropriately qualified personnel or failure to timely and effectively deploy such additional personnel against funded backlog could negatively affect our ability to grow our revenue. We may also not recognize revenue on funded backlog due to, among other reasons, the tardy submissions of invoices by our subcontractors and the expiration of the relevant appropriated funding in accordance with a predetermined expiration date such as the end of the U.S. governments fiscal year. The amount of our funded backlog is also subject to change, due to, among other factors: changes in appropriations that reflect changes in government policies or priorities resulting from various military, political, economic or international developments; changes in the use of government contracting vehicles, and the provisions therein used to procure our services; and adjustments to the scope of services under, or cancellation of contracts, by the applicable government at any time. Furthermore, even if our backlog results in revenue, the contracts may not be profitable. If we cannot collect our receivables or if payment is delayed, our business may be adversely affected by our inability to generate cash flow, provide working capital or continue our business operations. As of December 31, 2018, our accounts receivable, net was $623.3 million. We depend on the timely collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital and continue our business operations. If our customers fail to pay or delay the payment of invoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Our customers have in the past and may in the future delay or fail to pay invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds, lack of an approved budget or as a result of audit findings by government regulatory agencies. We cannot assure you that we will collect all our accounts receivable in excess of our allowance for doubtful accounts in a timely manner. The agreements governing our debt contain a number of restrictive covenants which may limit our ability to finance future operations, acquisitions or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. As of December 31, 2018, our total indebtedness was $429.2 million, which does not include $260.0 million of aggregate borrowings under our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility in connection with the consummation of our acquisition of OGSystems in January 2019. Our Credit Agreement and the agreements governing our Senior Notes contain a number of covenants that impose operating and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictions affect or will 39 Table of Contents affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:  incur additional indebtedness;  create liens;  pay dividends and make other distributions in respect of our equity securities;  redeem our equity securities;  distribute excess cash flow from foreign to domestic subsidiaries;  make loans, advances, investments or other restricted payments;  sell assets or receivables;  engage in certain business activities;  amend our ESOPs plan documents;  enter into transactions with affiliates; and  effect mergers or consolidations. In addition, our Credit Agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial ratio covenants, including a debt leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. These restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market or economic conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans, and could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest. A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments. If an event of default occurs, our creditors could elect to:  declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable;  require us to apply all of our available cash to repay the borrowings; or  prevent us from making debt service payments on some of our borrowings. If we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings when due, the lenders under our Credit Agreement could sell the collateral securing the borrowings under our Credit Agreement, which constitutes substantially all of our domestic and foreign, wholly owned subsidiaries assets. We may lose one or more members of our senior management team or fail to develop new leaders, which could cause a disruption in the management of our business. We believe that the future success of our business and our ability to operate profitably depends on the continued contributions of the members of our senior management and the continued development of new members of senior management. We rely on our senior management to generate business and execute programs successfully. In addition, the relationships and reputation that many members of our senior management team have established and maintain with our clients are important to our business and our ability to identify new business opportunities. We do not have any employment agreements providing for a specific term of employment with any members of our senior management. 40 Table of Contents The loss of any member of our senior management or our failure to continue to develop new members could impair our ability to identify and secure new contracts, to maintain good client relations, and to otherwise manage our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our services and operations sometimes involve handling or disposing of hazardous substances or dangerous materials, and we are subject to environmental requirements and risks which could result in significant costs, liabilities and obligations. Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, the health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Some of our services and operations involve the handling or disposal of hazardous substances or dangerous materials, including explosive, chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear materials. These activities generally subject us to extensive foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, which, among other things, require us to incur costs to comply with these regulations and could impose liability on us for handling or disposing of hazardous substances or dangerous materials. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Furthermore, failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanctions, including fines, penalties or suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government, and could also result in investigations, the imposition of corrective action or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In certain instances, citizen groups also have the ability to bring legal proceedings against us if we are not in compliance with environmental laws. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. We, like other businesses, can never completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from certain materials that we use in our business. If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to, these laws or regulations, it may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Certain environmental laws impose strict liability (i.e., no showing of fault is required) as well as joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations, regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from the consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. We have limited, and potentially insufficient, insurance coverage for expenses and losses that may arise in connection with environmental contamination. Finally, in connection with certain acquisitions, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses. Many of our field project sites and facilities are inherently dangerous workplaces. Failure to manage our field project sites and facilities safely could result in environmental disasters, employee deaths or injuries, reduced profitability, the loss of projects or clients and possible exposure to litigation. Our field project sites and facilities, particularly in our Critical Infrastructure business, often put our employees and others in close proximity with mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical 41 Table of Contents and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials. On some field project sites and in some of our facilities, we may be responsible for safety and, accordingly, we have an obligation to implement effective safety procedures. If these procedures are not appropriately implemented or are ineffective, our employees could be injured or killed, and we could be exposed to possible litigation. As a result, our failure to maintain adequate safety standards and equipment could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Prior to this offering, we were treated as an S Corporation, and claims of taxing authorities related to our prior status as an S Corporation could adversely affect us. Upon consummation of this offering, our status as an S Corporation will terminate and we will be treated as a C Corporation under the provisions of Sections 301 through 385 of the Code, which treat the corporation as an entity that is subject to U.S. federal income tax. If the unaudited, open tax years in which we were an S Corporation are audited by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and we are determined not to have qualified for, or to have violated any requirement for maintaining, our S Corporation status, we will be obligated to pay back taxes, interest and penalties. The amounts that we would be obligated to pay could include taxes on all our taxable income while we were an S Corporation. Any such claims could result in additional costs to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Prior to this offering we are 100% owned by the ESOP, which is a retirement plan that is intended to be qualified under the Code. If the ESOP failed to meet the requirements of a tax qualified retirement plan we could be subject to substantial penalties. The ESOP is a defined contribution retirement plan subject to the requirements of the Code and ERISA. The ESOP has received a determination letter, dated January 31, 2012, from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that it meets the requirements of a tax qualified retirement plan in form and we endeavor to maintain and administer the ESOP in compliance with all requirements of the Code and ERISA. However, the rules regarding tax qualified plans, and especially ESOPs, are complex and change frequently. Accordingly, it is possible that the ESOP may not have been administered in full compliance with all applicable rules under the Code or ERISA at all times. If the ESOP were determined not to be in material compliance with the Code or ERISA, then the ESOP could lose its tax qualified status and we could be subject to substantial penalties under the Code and ERISA which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, loss of the ESOPs tax-qualified status would adversely impact our prior treatment as an S Corporation. Negotiations with labor unions and possible work actions could divert management attention and disrupt operations. In addition, new collective bargaining agreements or amendments to existing agreements could increase our labor costs and operating expenses. We have entered into collective bargaining agreements for approximately 330 of our more than 15,600 employees as of January 31, 2019. The outcome of any future negotiations relating to union representation or collective bargaining agreements for these or other employees in the future may not be favorable to us. We may reach agreements in collective bargaining that increase our operating expenses and lower our net income as a result of higher wages or benefit expenses. In addition, negotiations with unions could divert management attention and disrupt operations, which may adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, we may have to address the threat of union-initiated work actions, including strikes. Depending on the nature of the threat or the type and duration of any work action, these actions could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results. 42 Table of Contents Foreign exchange rate risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects and negatively impact our backlog and our results of operations. Our financial condition and results of operations are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks resulting from our operations outside of the U.S. While we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures, or otherwise include contractual clauses to provide protection from currency fluctuations, we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk, particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. In addition, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact the U.S. dollar value of our backlog. We may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries. We also reflect the transaction gains or losses on movements in foreign currency rates, which were a $6,000 gain in fiscal 2016, $5.1 million gain in fiscal 2017 and $5.2 million loss in fiscal 2018. Risks Related to Our Common Stock and This Offering Our costs will increase significantly as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to complying with public company regulations. As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with these rules and regulations. Moreover, these rules and regulations relating to public companies will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect these new rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain and maintain director and officer liability insurance. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain and periodically evaluate our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge to satisfy the ongoing requirements of Section 404 and provide internal audit services. If our finance and accounting organization is unable for any reason to respond adequately to the increased demands that will result from being a public company, the quality and timeliness of our financial reporting may suffer and we could experience internal control weaknesses. Any consequences resulting from inaccuracies or delays in our reported financial statements could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock as well as an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected. As a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. In addition, beginning with our second annual 43 Table of Contents report on Form 10-K, we will be required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. The process of designing, implementing and testing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation is time-consuming, costly and complicated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner or to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by our stock exchange, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. There is no existing market for our common stock, and you cannot be certain that an active trading market or a specific share price will be established. Prior to this offering, there was no public market for shares of our common stock. We have applied to list our common stock on the NYSE. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our company will lead to the development of a trading market on such exchange or otherwise or how liquid that market might become. The initial public offering price for the shares of our common stock will be determined by negotiations between us and the underwriters, and may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market following this offering. The market price for our common stock may decline below the initial public offering price, and our stock price is likely to be volatile. If our stock price fluctuates after this offering, you could lose a significant part of your investment. The market price of our stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:  the opinions and estimates of any securities analysts who publish research about us after this offering;  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments;  variations in quarterly operating results;  changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole;  future sales of our common stock; and  investor perception of us and the industries we operate in. As a result of these factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the initial offering price. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. In the past, 44 Table of Contents stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business. Our operating results and share price may be volatile, and the market price of our common stock after this offering may drop below the price you pay. Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future as a publicly traded company. In addition, securities markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance. We and the underwriters will negotiate to determine the initial public offering price. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the initial public offering price or at all. Our operating results and the trading price of our shares may fluctuate in response to various factors, including:  market conditions in the broader stock market;  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;  introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;  changes in our awards, backlog and book-to-bill ratios in a given period;  issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations;  results of operations that vary from expectations of securities analysis and investors;  guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;  strategic actions by us or our competitors;  announcement by us, our competitors or our acquisition targets;  sales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our stock;  additions or departures of key personnel;  regulatory, legal or political developments;  public response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;  litigation and governmental investigations;  seasonality associated with U.S. federal, state, regional and local government funding and spending;  changing economic conditions;  changes in accounting principles;  default under agreements governing our indebtedness;  exchange rate fluctuations; and  other events or factors, including those from natural disasters, war, actors of terrorism or responses to these events. These and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause our operating results and the market price and demand for our shares to fluctuate substantially. While we believe that 45 Table of Contents operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation. Sales of outstanding shares of our common stock into the market in the future could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. Immediately after this offering, we will have outstanding shares of our common stock. Of these shares, the shares sold in this offering will be freely tradable except for any shares purchased by our affiliates as that term is used in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. At various times after the date of this prospectus, the remaining shares will become available for resale in the public market, in compliance with the requirements of the federal securities laws and in accordance with lock-up agreements that the holders of these shares have with the underwriters. However, the underwriters can waive these restrictions and allow these stockholders to sell their shares at any time without prior notice. If the remaining shares not sold in this offering described above are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly. Following the consummation of this offering, qualifying ESOP participants will have the right to receive distributions of shares of our common stock from the ESOP and to sell such shares in the market. Approximately shares of common stock will be held by the ESOP following consummation of this offering. We intend to register the shares held by the ESOP on a Form S-8 in connection with this offering. Participants are generally entitled to distributions from the ESOP only following termination of employment or upon death and in order to diversify their accounts upon attaining a specified age and completing a specified number of years of service as described in more detail under the heading Executive CompensationEmployee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). During the 180-day lock-up period following the date of this prospectus, ESOP distributions will be made in the form of cash. Beginning on the 181 st day following the date of this prospectus, ESOP distributions will be made in the form of shares of our common stock (other than distributions in respect of fractional shares, which will be made in cash). Upon receiving a distribution of our common stock from the ESOP, a participant will be able to sell such shares in the market, subject to any requirements of the federal securities laws and any further lock-up agreement restrictions that the participant may have with the underwriters. As of , there were shares eligible for distribution and shares were eligible for diversification elections. We cannot predict if participants will make diversification elections or elect to take distributions from the ESOP. As a result, we cannot predict the effect, if any, that these distributions and the corresponding sales of shares by the participants following expiration of the 180-day lock-up period may have on the market price of our common stock. Distribution of substantial amounts of our common stock to participants may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 46 Table of Contents The issuance of additional stock, not reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans or otherwise, will dilute all other stockholdings. After this offering, we will have an aggregate of shares of common stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for issuance under our 2019 Plan, under the 2019 Awards or otherwise. We may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders. The issuance of additional shares could be dilutive to existing holders. We historically have made annual contributions of our common stock to the ESOP. We made contributions of 656,027 shares in fiscal 2016, 596,832 shares in fiscal 2017 and 627,241 shares in fiscal 2018 of our common stock to the ESOP, and intend to continue to make annual contributions to the ESOP after we are a public company. Investors in this offering will suffer immediate and substantial dilution. The initial public offering price of our common stock is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of our outstanding common stock immediately after this offering. Therefore, if you purchase our common stock in this offering, you will incur an immediate dilution of $ in net tangible book value per share from the price you paid. Your ability to influence corporate matters may be limited because the ESOP beneficially owns a substantial amount of our stock and the ESOP, as a majority stockholder, is expected to have substantial control over us after the offering. Our common stock, which is the stock we are selling in this offering, has one vote per share. Upon completion of this offering, the ESOP will beneficially own approximately % of our outstanding common stock. Under the terms of the ESOP, each participant has the ability to direct the ESOP Trustee on the voting of the shares allocated to his or her account under the ESOP. However, the ESOP Trustee will vote any shares that a participant does not direct the voting, or any shares that are held by the ESOP which are not allocated to participants accounts. As such, the ESOP Trustee may be able to exercise a greater influence than otherwise over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. The purpose of the ESOP is to provide retirement income to employees and their beneficiaries. Accordingly, the interests of the ESOP and the ESOP participants may be contrary to yours as an outside investor. ERISA sets forth certain fiduciary requirements that require an ERISA fiduciary, like the ESOP Trustee, to act solely in the interests of plan participants and their beneficiaries for the purpose of providing retirement benefits. The Department of Labor, which is the agency with the authority to interpret and enforce the fiduciary sections of ERISA, has indicated in its interpretative guidance that voting is an ERISA fiduciary act. The ESOP Trustees fiduciary duties under ERISA to the ESOP and its participants may cause the ESOP Trustee to override participants voting directions to the extent that following such directions would violate ERISA. In such case, the ESOP Trustee will be able to exercise voting control over all of the ESOPs shares. Further, following completion of this offering, the interests of the minority stockholders may not be aligned with those of the ESOP as the majority stockholder, because the ESOP Trustee is required under ERISA to act in the best interest of the ESOP participants and beneficiaries, this may present a conflict. As a result, the concentration of ownership in our company by the ESOP could delay or prevent a change in control of our company or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could reduce the price of our common stock. 47 Table of Contents We are a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards and, as a result, will qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements. Following the closing of this offering, the ESOP will hold common stock representing approximately % of the voting power of our common stock. As a result, we will be considered a controlled company for the purposes of NYSE rules and corporate governance standards. As a controlled company, we will be exempt from certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including those that would otherwise require our board of directors to have a majority of independent directors and require that we either establish compensation and nominating and corporate governance board committees, each comprised entirely of independent directors, or otherwise ensure that the compensation of our executive officers and nominees for directors are determined or recommended to the board of directors by the independent members of the board of directors. While we intend to have a majority of independent directors, and our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees to consist entirely of independent directors, we may decide at a later time to rely on one of the controlled company exemptions. Accordingly, our common stock may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements. Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds we receive in this offering and might not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment. Our management will have broad discretion to use our net proceeds from this offering, and you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these proceeds. Our management may not apply our net proceeds from this offering in ways that increase the value of your investment. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay the outstanding balances under our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility, to fund future acquisitions and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Our management might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on any investment of these net proceeds. You will not have the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use our net proceeds from this offering. Our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, which could limit our business plan or adversely affect your investment. Our business and strategic plans may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of new equity securities, debt or a combination of both. However, any decline in the market price of our common stock could impair our ability to raise capital. Separately, additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our operations or new investments. If we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity securities, existing stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest. Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay a change in management and limit our share price. Upon the consummation of this offering, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that will become effective prior to the completion of this offering could make it more difficult for a third 48 Table of Contents party to acquire control of us even if such a change in control would increase the value of our common stock and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current board of directors or management. We have a number of anti-takeover devices that will be in place prior to the completion of this offering that will hinder takeover attempts and could reduce the market value of our common stock or prevent sale at a premium. Our anti-takeover provisions:  permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;  provide that our board of directors will be classified into three classes with staggered, three year terms and that directors may only be removed for cause;  include blank-check preferred stock, the preference, rights and other terms of which may be set by the board of directors and could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders;  eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;  specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors or a board committee authorized with the power to call such meetings;  prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;  provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors; and  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholders meetings. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a period of time. Our certificate of incorporation will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. Our certificate of incorporation which will become effective prior to the closing of this offering will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following civil actions:  any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;  any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents or our stockholders;  any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or  any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. 49 Table of Contents This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. After the completion of this offering, we do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future. After the completion of this offering, other than the IPO Dividend, we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, any contractual restrictions, our indebtedness, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Consequently, investors may need to sell all or part of their holdings of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have, and may never obtain, research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively impacted. If we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. 50 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, the following:  any issue that compromises our relationships with the U.S. federal government or its agencies or other state, local or foreign governments or agencies;  any issues that damage our professional reputation;  changes in governmental priorities that shift expenditures away from agencies or programs that we support;  our dependence on long-term government contracts, which are subject to the governments budgetary approval process;  the size of our addressable markets and the amount of government spending on private contractors;  failure by us or our employees to obtain and maintain necessary security clearances or certifications;  failure to comply with numerous laws and regulations;  changes in government procurement, contract or other practices or the adoption by governments of new laws, rules, regulations and programs in a manner adverse to us;  the termination or nonrenewal of our government contracts, particularly our contracts with the U.S. federal government;  our ability to compete effectively in the competitive bidding process and delays, contract terminations or cancellations caused by competitors protests of major contract awards received by us;  our ability to generate revenue under certain of our contracts;  any inability to attract, train or retain employees with the requisite skills, experience and security clearances;  the loss of members of senior management or failure to develop new leaders;  misconduct or other improper activities from our employees or subcontractors;  our ability to realize the full value of our backlog and the timing of our receipt of revenue under contracts included in backlog;  changes in the mix of our contracts and our ability to accurately estimate or otherwise recover expenses, time and resources for our contracts;  changes in estimates used in recognizing revenue;  internal system or service failures and security breaches; 51 Table of Contents  inherent uncertainties and potential adverse developments in legal proceedings, including litigation, audits, reviews and investigations, which may result in materially adverse judgments, settlements or other unfavorable outcomes; and  other risks and factors listed under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this prospectus. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, business strategy and financial needs. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors described in the section captioned Risk Factors and elsewhere in this prospectus. These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this prospectus include additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance. Furthermore, new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus. We cannot assure you that the results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this prospectus, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. You should read this prospectus and the documents that we reference in this prospectus and have filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. The forward-looking statements made in this prospectus relate only to events as of the date on which such statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this prospectus or to conform such statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law. 52 Table of Contents USE OF PROCEEDS We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $ million, based upon the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, we estimate that the net proceeds to be received by us will be approximately $ million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately $ million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Similarly, each increase (decrease) of 1.0 million in the number of shares offered by us would increase (decrease) the net proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately $ million, assuming that the assumed initial public offering price remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and financial flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and thereby enable access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders. We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to repay the outstanding principal balance of approximately $150.0 million under our Term Loan (plus any accrued interest) and the outstanding principal balance of approximately $ million under our Revolving Credit Facility (plus any accrued interest), to fund future acquisitions and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility was $180.0 million, which does not include $110.0 million we borrowed under our Revolving Credit Facility in January 2019 to partially finance the OGSystems Acquisition. In May 2018, we borrowed $260.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility to partially finance the acquisition of Polaris Alpha. Under the terms of our Credit Agreement, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin, or LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for Base Rate loans is a range of 0.125% to 1.00% and the applicable margin for LIBOR loans is a range of 1.125% to 2.00%, both based on our leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of November 15, 2022. We intend to use $ million of our net proceeds from this offering to repay the outstanding balance under our Revolving Credit Facility upon the consummation of this offering. In January 2019, we borrowed $150.0 million under our Term Loan Agreement to partially finance the OGSystems Acquisition. Our Term Loan is comprised of Offshore Rate Loans and Base Rate Loans (each as defined in the Term Loan Agreement), with an initial aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million. The Offshore Rate Loans bear interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR, divided by 1.00 minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage, plus 1.25%. The Base Rate Loans bear interest at a rate per annum of the sum of (a) the highest of (1) the administrative agents reference rate; (2) the rate equal to 1.50% per annum above the Offshore Rate; and (3) the rate equal to 0.50% per annum above the latest federal funds rate, plus (b) 0.25%. The Term Loan has a maturity date of January 3, 2020. We intend to use $ million of our net proceeds from this offering to repay the outstanding balance under our Term Loan upon the consummation of this offering. 53 Table of Contents We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from this offering and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds from this offering. Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds that we receive in this offering in short-term and long-term interest-bearing obligations, including government- and investment-grade debt securities and money market funds. Affiliates of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, MUFG Securities Americas Inc. and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. are each a lender under the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility. A portion of the net proceeds from this offering will be used to repay borrowings under the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility. As a result, we expect more than 5% of the net proceeds from this offering will be paid to affiliates of each of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, MUFG Securities Americas Inc. and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. Therefore, this offering is being made in compliance with FINRA Rule 5121. As a result of this conflict of interest, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC has agreed to act as the qualified independent underwriter with respect to this offering. See the section entitled UnderwritingConflicts of Interest. 54 Table of Contents DIVIDEND POLICY We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and, other than the IPO Dividend, do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any further determination to pay dividends on our capital stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions under our Senior Notes, Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement, general business conditions, and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant. Our ability to pay dividends may also be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of us or our subsidiaries. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Common Stock and This OfferingAfter the completion of this offering, we do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future. 55 Table of Contents CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth cash and cash equivalents, as well as our capitalization, as of December 31, 2018:  on an actual basis;  on a pro forma basis to give effect to (i) the termination of our S Corporation status in connection with this offering and our election to be treated as a C Corporation under the Code, assuming our S Corporation status terminated on December 31, 2018, which includes the net effect of recording deferred tax assets and liabilities at an assumed statutory income tax rate of 28.8%, totaling $70.7 million, and the reclassification of undistributed retained earnings to additional paid-in capital and (ii) the payment of the IPO Dividend of $52.1 million; and  on a pro forma as adjusted basis to give further effect to the issuance and sale by us of shares of common stock in our initial public offering, the receipt of the net proceeds from our sale of these shares at an assumed initial public offering price of common stock of $ per share, the midpoint of the price range on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us and repayment of $ million outstanding indebtedness under our Term Loan and $ million of outstanding indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility.

Each increase (decrease) of 1.0 million in the number of shares offered by us would increase (decrease) the pro forma as adjusted amount of cash and cash equivalents, common stock and additional paid-in capital, total shareholders equity and total capitalization by $ million, assuming that the assumed initial public offering price remains the same and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. (2) Does not include $73.8 million of cash of consolidated joint ventures and $1.0 million of restricted cash and investments as of December 31, 2018. In addition, in January 2019, the Company used $40.3 million of cash on hand to pay for a portion of the OGSystems Acquisition. (3) As of December 31, 2018, we had (i) $250.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Senior Notes and (ii) $180.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesDebt. In January 2019, the Company borrowed $150.0 million under our Term Loan and $110.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility in connection with the consummation of the OGSystems Acquisition. (4) While this offering will create a public market for our common stock, to the extent the IPO Dividend is not sufficient to satisfy all qualifying distribution elections to be paid to ESOP participants during the 180-day lock-up period, we may be required to settle ESOP redemptions in cash during the 180-day lock up period. As all ESOP shares are potentially redeemable (e.g. upon death of an employee) for cash during the 180-day lock up period, the table does not reflect a reclassification of redeemable common stock held by the ESOP from temporary equity to permanent equity, as such reclassification is not expected until the 180-day lock-up period lapses and the interests redeemed by ESOP participants become settleable in shares of the public company. The table above does not include:  347,223 shares of our common stock that may be issued settlement of the 2019 Awards; and  3,900,000 shares of common stock reserved for future grant or issuance under our 2019 Plan (less any shares issued pursuant to the 2019 Awards after the effective date of the 2019 Plan), which will become effective upon the completion of this offering. The table above assumes no exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock. 57 Table of Contents DILUTION Dilution is the amount by which the offering price paid by the purchasers of our common stock in this offering exceeds the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our common stock after this offering. Our net tangible book value as of December 31, 2018 was $38.8 million. Net tangible book value per share is determined at any date by subtracting our total liabilities from the total book value of our tangible assets and dividing the difference by the number of shares of our common stock deemed to be outstanding at that date. If you invest in our common stock in this offering, your ownership interest will be immediately diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price per share and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our common stock after this offering. Our pro forma net tangible book value as of December 31, 2018 would have been $57.3 million, or $2.20 per share of common stock. Pro forma net tangible book value per share is determined at any date by subtracting our total liabilities from the total book value of our tangible assets and dividing the difference by the number of shares of our common stock, after giving effect to (i) the termination of our S Corporation status in connection with our initial public offering and our election to be treated as a C Corporation under the Code, including an increase in net deferred tax assets of $70.7 million, assuming our S Corporation status terminated on December 31, 2018, and (ii) the payment of the IPO Dividend of $52.1 million. Our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of December 31, 2018 would have been $ million, or $ per share of common stock, after giving effect to (i) the sale of shares of our common stock in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and (ii) repayment of $ million of outstanding indebtedness under our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility in connection with the consummation of this offering. This represents an immediate dilution in pro forma net tangible book value of $ per share to investors purchasing our common stock in this offering. We determine dilution by subtracting the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering from the amount of cash that a new investor paid for a share of our common stock. The following table illustrates this dilution: Assumed initial public offering price per share $ Net tangible book value per share as of December 31, 2018 $ 1.49 Increase in net tangible book value per share of common stock attributable to our conversion from an S Corporation to a C Corporation and payment of the IPO Dividend 0.71 Pro forma net tangible book value per share as of December 31, 2018 before this offering 2.20 Increase in pro forma net tangible book value per share attributable to this offering Pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering $ Dilution per share to investors in this offering $ A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of common stock of $ per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase (decrease), our pro forma net tangible book value per share after this offering by $ , and would increase (decrease) dilution per share to new investors in this offering by $ , assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this 58 Table of Contents prospectus, remains the same and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Similarly, each increase (decrease) of 1.0 million shares in the number of shares offered by us would increase (decrease) our pro forma net tangible book value per share after this offering by $ per share and decrease (increase) the dilution to new investors by $ per share, assuming that the assumed initial public offering price remains the same, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters fully exercise their option to purchase additional shares and all such shares are sold by the Company, pro forma net tangible book value after this offering would increase to approximately $ per share, and there would be an immediate dilution of approximately $ per share to investors in this offering. In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Furthermore, we may choose to issue common stock as part or all of the consideration in acquisitions of other companies and as part of our planned growth and acquisition strategy. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to our stockholders. The following table shows, as of December 31, 2018, after giving effect to the pro forma adjustments described above, including this offering, the number of shares of common stock purchased from us, the total consideration paid to us and the average price paid per share by existing stockholders and by new investors purchasing common stock in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages): Shares Purchased Total Consideration Average Price Per Share Number Percent Amount Percent Existing stockholders 26,057,603 % $ 662,165 % $ 25.41 New investors $ Total 100 % $ 100 % A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase (decrease) the total consideration paid by new investors and total consideration paid by all stockholders by $ million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The above table and discussion excludes:  347,223 shares of our common stock that may be issued upon settlement of the 2019 Awards; and  3,900,000 shares of common stock reserved for future grant or issuance under our 2019 Plan (less any shares issued pursuant to the 2019 Awards after the effective date of the 2019 Plan), which will become effective upon the completion of this offering. 59 Table of Contents Except as otherwise indicated, the above discussion and tables assume no exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares of our common stock from us. If the underwriters option to purchase additional shares of our common stock were exercised in full, our existing stockholders would own % and the investors purchasing shares of our common stock in this offering would own % of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after completion of this offering. 60 Table of Contents SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA The following tables present consolidated financial and other data and pro forma information to reflect our conversion from an S Corporation to a C Corporation for income tax purposes.

For fiscal 2018, due to the judgment being vacated, the Company reversed the accrued liability of $55.1 million to revenue and $74.6 million to other income. (b) Reflects amortization of the deferred gain on prior sale-leaseback transactions in fiscal 2011. See Note 9Sale-Leasebacks in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. (c) Reflects costs incurred in connection with acquisitions and other non-recurring transaction costs, including primarily fees paid for professional services and employee retention. (d) Reflects costs associated with and related to our corporate restructuring initiatives, including expenses incurred in connection with a restructuring program we began implementing in 2015. See Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesRestructuring in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. (e) Reflects implementation costs incurred in connection with a new human resources and payroll application. (f) Fiscal 2016 includes a $3.5 million loss from the sale of a subsidiary, a $0.9 million gain on the sale of fixed assets, a $0.8 million gain related to disposed businesses and a $0.5 million gain related to settlement proceeds received for an already completed contract. Fiscal 2017 includes non-operating lease termination costs of $1.8 million, a $1.8 million loss related to disposed businesses, a $1.0 million loss from the sale of fixed assets and a $0.5 million loss related to several individually insignificant items that are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual in nature. Fiscal 2018 includes a $0.6 million loss related to several individually insignificant items that are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual in nature. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our operating performance included in this prospectus because it is used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. We discuss Adjusted EBITDA because our management uses this measure for business planning purposes, including to manage the business against internal projected results of operations and measure the performance of the business generally. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP measure of our financial performance or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as measures of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Parsons Corporation, adjusted to include net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and to exclude interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These other items include, among other things, impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets, interest and other expenses recognized on litigation matters, amortization of deferred gain resulting from sale-leaseback transactions, expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and other non-recurring transaction costs and expenses related to our corporate restructuring initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for managements discretionary use, as it does not reflect tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future, including, among other things, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our 63 Table of Contents GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. The following table shows Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation for each of our reportable segments and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests: Fiscal Year Ended (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 30, 2016 December 29, 2017 December 31, 2018 Federal Solutions Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation $ 79,376 $ 89,269 $ 114,571 Critical Infrastructure Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to Parsons Corporation 81,206 86,471 97,779 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests 12,570 14,891 17,407 Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 173,152 $ 190,631 $ 229,757 See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSegment Results," and "Note 20Segments Information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for further discussion regarding our segment Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation. (2) Net Income Margin is calculated as net income (loss) including noncontrolling interest divided by revenue in the applicable period. (3) Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue in the applicable period. 64 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is intended to help prospective investors understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus. The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Overview We are a leading provider of technology-driven solutions in the defense, intelligence and critical infrastructure markets. We provide technical design and engineering services and software to address our customers challenges. We have developed significant expertise and differentiated capabilities in key areas of cybersecurity, intelligence, defense, military training and development, connected communities, physical infrastructure and mobility solutions. By combining our talented team of professionals and advanced technology, we help solve complex technical challenges to enable a safer, smarter and more interconnected world. We operate in two reporting segments, Federal Solutions and Critical Infrastructure. Our Federal Solutions business is a high-end services and technology provider to the U.S. government. Our Critical Infrastructure business provides integrated design and engineering services for complex physical and digital infrastructure to state and local governments and large companies. Our employees provide services pursuant to contracts that we are awarded by the customer and specific task orders relating to such contracts. These contracts are often multi-year, which provides us backlog and visibility on our revenues for future periods. Many of our contracts and task orders are subject to renewal and rebidding at the end of their term, and some are subject to the exercise of contract options and issuance of delivery or task orders by the applicable government entity. In addition to focusing on increasing our revenues through increased contract awards and backlog, we focus our financial performance on margin expansion and cash flow. Key Metrics We manage and assess the performance of our business by evaluating a variety of metrics. The following table sets forth selected key metrics: Fiscal Year Ended (U.S. dollars in millions, except Book-to-Bill) December 30, 2016 December 29, 2017 December 31, 2018 Awards $ 3,767.7 $ 3,404.7 $ 4,484.5 Backlog(1) $ 6,287.3 $ 6,422.6 $ 7,971.0 Book-to-Bill 1.24 1.13 1.26 (1) Difference between our backlog of $8.0 billion and our remaining unsatisfied performance obligations, or RUPO, of $5.3 billion, each as of December 31, 2018, is due to (i) unissued 65 Table of Contents delivery orders and unexercised option years, to the extent their issuance or exercise is probable, as well as (ii) contract awards, to the extent we believe contract execution and funding is probable. Awards Awards generally represent the amount of revenue expected to be earned in the future from funded and unfunded contract awards received during the period. Contract awards include both new and re-compete contracts and task orders. Given that new contract awards generate growth, we closely track our new awards each year. The following table summarizes the total value of new awards for the periods presented below: Fiscal Year Ended (U.S. dollars in millions) December 30, 2016 December 29, 2017 December 31, 2018 Federal Solutions $ 1,600.6 $ 1,278.5 $ 1,806.5 Critical Infrastructure 2,167.1 2,126.2 2,678.0 Total Awards $ 3,767.7 $ 3,404.7 $ 4,484.5 The change in new awards from year to year is primarily due to ordinary course fluctuations in our business. The volume of contract awards can fluctuate in any given period due to win rate and the timing and size of the awards issued by our customers. Backlog We define backlog to include the following two components:  FundedFunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts.  UnfundedUnfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts. Backlog includes (i) unissued delivery orders and unexercised option years, to the extent their issuance or exercise is probable, as well as (ii) contract awards, to the extent we believe contract execution and funding is probable. 66 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the value of our backlog at the respective dates presented: As of (U.S. dollars in millions) December 30, 2016 December 29, 2017 December 31, 2018 Backlog: Federal Solutions Funded $ 1,672.4 $ 1,313.8 $ 1,858.4 Unfunded 1,407.5 1,948.8 2,629.6 Total Federal Solutions Backlog 3,079.9 3,262.6 4,488.0 Critical Infrastructure Funded 3,207.3 3,160.0 3,483.0 Unfunded    Total Critical Infrastructure Backlog 3,207.3 3,160.0 3,483.0 Total Backlog(1) $ 6,287.3 $ 6,422.6 $ 7,971.0 (1) Difference between our backlog of $8.0 billion and our RUPO of $5.3 billion, each as of December 31, 2018, is due to (i) unissued delivery orders and unexercised option years, to the extent their issuance or exercise is probable, as well as (ii) contract awards, to the extent we believe contract execution and funding is probable. Our backlog includes orders under contracts that in some cases extend for several years. For example, the U.S. Congress generally appropriates funds for our U.S. federal government customers on a yearly basis, even though their contracts with us may call for performance that is expected to take a number of years to complete. As a result, our federal contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term and all or some of the work to be performed under the contracts may remain unfunded unless and until the U.S. Congress makes subsequent appropriations and the procuring agency allocates funding to the contract. We expect to recognize $2.6 billion of our funded backlog at December 31, 2018 as revenues in the following twelve months. However, our government customers may cancel their contracts with us at any time through a termination for convenience or may elect to not exercise option periods under such contracts. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would not receive anticipated future revenues, but would generally be permitted to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed. See Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our BusinessWe may not realize the full value of our backlog, which may result in lower than expected revenue. The changes in backlog from year to year were primarily due to ordinary course fluctuations in our business. Our backlog will fluctuate in any given period based on the volume of awards issued in comparison to the revenue generated from our existing contracts. Book-to-Bill Book-to-bill is the ratio of total awards to total revenue recorded in the same period. Our management believes our book-to-bill ratio is a useful indicator of our potential future revenue growth in that it measures the rate at which we are generating new awards compared to our current revenue. To drive future revenue growth, our goal is for the level of awards in a given period to exceed the revenue booked. A book-to-bill ratio is greater than 1.0 indicates that awards generated in a given period exceeded the revenue recognized in the same period, while a book-to-bill ratio of less than 1.0 67 Table of Contents indicates that awards generated in such period were less than the revenue recognized in such period. The following table sets forth the book-to-bill ratio for the periods presented below: Fiscal Year Ended December 30, 2016 December 29, 2017 December 31, 2018 Federal Solutions 1.50 1.18 1.22 Critical Infrastructure 1.10 1.10 1.29 Overall 1.24 1.13 1.26 Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations We believe that the financial performance of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors, including those highlighted in this section. Our operating performance will depend upon many variables, including the success of our growth strategies and the timing and size of investments and expenditures that we choose to undertake, as well as market growth and other factors that are not within our control. Government Spending Changes in the relative mix of government spending and areas of spending growth, with shifts in priorities on homeland security, intelligence, defense-related programs, infrastructure and urbanization, and continued increased spending on technology and innovation, including cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, connected communities and physical infrastructure, could impact our business and results of operations. Cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives, current and future budget restrictions, spending cuts and other efforts to reduce government spending could cause our government customers to reduce or delay funding or invest appropriated funds on a less consistent basis or not at all, and demand for our solutions or services could diminish. Furthermore, any disruption in the functioning of government agencies, including as a result of government closures and shutdowns, could have a negative impact on our operations and cause us to lose revenue or incur additional costs due to, among other things, our inability to deploy our staff to customer locations or facilities as a result of such disruptions. Federal Budget Uncertainty There is uncertainty around the timing, extent, nature and effect of Congressional and other U.S. government actions to address budgetary constraints, caps on the discretionary budget for defense and non-defense departments and agencies, and the ability of Congress to determine how to allocate the available budget authority and pass appropriations bills to fund both U.S. government departments and agencies that are, and those that are not, subject to the caps. Additionally, budget deficits and the growing U.S. national debt increase pressure on the U.S. government to reduce federal spending across all federal agencies, with uncertainty about the size and timing of those reductions. Furthermore, delays in the completion of future U.S. government budgets could in the future delay procurement of the federal government services we provide. A reduction in the amount of, or reductions, delays, or cancellations of funding for, services that we are contracted to provide to the U.S. government as a result of any of these impacts or related initiatives, legislation or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Regulations Increased audit, review, investigation and general scrutiny by government agencies of performance under government contracts and compliance with the terms of those contracts and 68 Table of Contents applicable laws could affect our operating results. Negative publicity and increased scrutiny of government contractors in general, including us, relating to government expenditures for contractor services and incidents involving the mishandling of sensitive or classified information as well as the increasingly complex requirements of the U.S. Department of Defense and the United States intelligence community, including those related to cybersecurity, could impact our ability to perform in the markets we serve. Competitive Markets The industries we operate in consist of a large number of enterprises ranging from small, niche-oriented companies to multi-billion dollar corporations that serve many government and commercial customers. We compete on the basis of our technical expertise, technological innovation, our ability to deliver cost-effective multi-faceted services in a timely manner, our reputation and relationships with our customers, qualified and/or security-clearance personnel, and pricing. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the markets in which we operate because of our proven track record, long-term customer relationships, technology innovation, scalable and agile business offerings and world class talent. Our ability to effectively deliver on project engagements and successfully assist our customers affects our ability to win new contracts and drives our financial performance. Acquired Operations Polaris Alpha On May 31, 2018, we acquired Polaris Alpha for $489.1 million. Polaris Alpha is an advanced, technology-focused provider of innovative mission solutions for national security, intelligence and other U.S. federal customers. The acquisition was funded by cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. The financial results of Polaris Alpha have been included in our consolidated results of operations from June 1, 2018 onward. OGSystems On January 7, 2019, we acquired OGSystems for $300.3 million. OGSystems provides geospatial intelligence, big data analytics and threat mitigation for defense and intelligence customers. The acquisition was funded by cash on hand and borrowings under our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility. The financial results of OGSystems is not included in our consolidated results of operations for the periods presented in this prospectus. Seasonality Our results may be affected by variances as a result of seasonality we experience across our businesses. This pattern is typically driven by the U.S. federal government fiscal year-end, September 30. While not certain, it is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of the U.S. federal government fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds. In addition, we have also historically experienced higher bid and proposal costs in the months leading up to the U.S. federal government fiscal year-end as we pursue new contract opportunities expected to be awarded early in the following U.S. federal government fiscal year as a result of funding appropriated for that U.S. federal government fiscal year. Furthermore, many U.S. state governments with fiscal years ending on June 30 tend to accelerate spending during their first quarter, when new funding becomes available. We may continue to experience this seasonality in future periods, and our results of operations may be affected by it. 69 Table of Contents Post-Offering Expenses As a public company, we will be implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. We expect to incur additional annual expenses related to these steps and, among other things, additional directors and officers liability insurance, director fees, reporting requirements of the SEC, transfer agent fees, additional accounting, legal and administrative personnel, increased auditing and legal fees and similar expenses. Taxes Historically, we have elected to be taxed under the provisions of Subchapter S of the Code for federal tax purposes. As a result, our income has not been subject to U.S. federal income taxes or state income taxes in those states where the S Corporation status is recognized. No provision or liability for federal or state income tax has been provided in our financial statements except for those states where the S Corporation status is not recognized and for the 1.5% California franchise tax to which we are also subject as a California S Corporation. The provision for income tax in the historical periods prior to our initial public offering consists of these taxes. In connection with our initial public offering, our S Corporation status will terminate and we will be treated as a C Corporation under Subchapter C of the Code. The revocation of our S Corporation election will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our effective income tax rate will increase and our net income will decrease since we will be subject to both federal and state taxes on our earnings. Results of Operations In October 2018, our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from the last Friday on or before the calendar year to December 31st. Accordingly, the fiscal year end for fiscal 2018 is December 31, 2018, the fiscal year end for fiscal 2017 is December 29, 2017 and the fiscal year end for fiscal 2016 is December 30, 2016. Revenue Our revenue consists of both services provided by our employees and pass-through fees from subcontractors and other direct costs. Our Federal Solutions segment derives revenue primarily from the U.S. federal government and our Critical Infrastructure segment derives revenue primarily from government and commercial customers. We recognize revenue for work performed under cost-plus, time-and-materials and fixed-price contracts, as follows: Under cost-plus contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable or otherwise defined costs incurred, plus a fee. The contracts may also include incentives for various performance criteria, including quality, timeliness, safety and cost-effectiveness. In addition, costs are generally subject to review by clients and regulatory audit agencies, and such reviews could result in costs being disputed as nonreimbursable under the terms of the contract. Revenue for cost-plus contracts are generally recognized using the cost-to-cost measure of progress method. Accounting for the sales and profits on performance obligations for which progress is measured using the cost-to-cost method involves the preparation of estimates of: (1) transaction price and (2) total costs at completion, which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contracts statement of work. Under time-and-materials contracts, hourly billing rates are negotiated and charged to clients based on the actual time spent on a project. In addition, clients reimburse actual out-of-pocket costs for other direct costs and expenses that are incurred in connection with the performance under the contract. Revenue on time-and-materials contracts are recognized as services are performed and are contractually billable. 70 Table of Contents Under firm fixed price, or FFP contracts, clients pay an agreed fixed-amount negotiated in advance for a specified scope of work. Revenue on FFP contracts is generally recognized using the cost-to-cost measure of progress method. Please refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Polices in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for a further description of our policies on revenue recognition. The table below presents the percentage of total revenue for each type of contract. Fiscal Year Ended December 30, 2016 December 29, 2017 December 31, 2018 Cost-plus 38 % 36 % 41 % Time-and-materials 29 % 29 % 27 % Fixed-price 33 % 35 % 32 % The amount of risk and potential reward varies under each type of contract. Under cost-plus contracts, there is limited financial risk, because we are reimbursed for all allowable costs up to a ceiling. However, profit margins on this type of contract tend to be lower than on time-and-materials and fixed-price contracts. Under time-and-materials contracts, we are reimbursed for the hours worked using the predetermined hourly rates for each labor category. In addition, we are typically reimbursed for other direct contract costs and expenses at cost. We assume financial risk on time-and-materials contracts because our labor costs may exceed the negotiated billing rates. Profit margins on well-managed time-and-materials contracts tend to be higher than profit margins on cost-plus contracts as long as we are able to staff those contracts with people who have an appropriate skill set. Under fixed-price contracts, we are required to deliver the objectives under the contract for a pre-determined price. Compared to time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts, fixed-price contracts generally offer higher profit margin opportunities because we receive the full benefit of any cost savings, but they also generally involve greater financial risk because we bear the risk of any cost overruns. In the aggregate, the contract type mix in our revenue for any given period will affect that periods profitability. Over time, we have experienced a relatively stable contract mix. Our recognition of profit on long-term contracts requires the use of assumptions related to transaction price and total cost of completion. Estimates are continually evaluated as work progresses and are revised when necessary. When a change in estimate is determined to have an impact on contract profit we record a positive or negative adjustment to revenue and/or direct cost of contracts. We recognized a net operating income decrease related to changes in estimates at contract completion of $22.4 million in fiscal 2016, $23.8 million in fiscal 2017 and $2.3 million in fiscal 2018. Joint Ventures We conduct a portion of our business through joint ventures or similar partnership arrangements. For the joint ventures we control, we consolidate all the revenues and expenses in our income statement (including revenues and expenses attributable to noncontrolling interests). For the joint ventures we do not control, we recognize equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures. Our revenues included $127.7 million in fiscal 2016, $112.1 million in fiscal 2017 and $144.7 million in fiscal 2018 related to services we provided to our unconsolidated joint ventures. Operating costs and expenses Operating costs and expenses primarily include direct costs of contracts and indirect, general and administrative expenses. Costs associated with compensation related expenses for our people and 71 Table of Contents facilities, which includes ESOP contribution expenses, are the most significant component of our operating expenses. Total ESOP contribution expense was $41.8 million for fiscal 2016, $40.6 million for fiscal 2017 and $47.0 million for fiscal 2018, and is recorded in Direct cost of contracts and Indirect, general and administrative expenses. We expect operating expenses to increase due to our anticipated growth and the incremental costs associated with being a public company. However, on a forward-looking basis, we generally expect these costs to decline as a percentage of our total revenue as we realize the benefits of scale. Direct costs of contracts consist of direct labor and associated fringe benefits, indirect overhead, subcontractor costs, travel expenses and other expenses incurred to perform on contracts. Indirect, general and administrative expenses include salaries and wages and fringe benefits of our employees not performing work directly for customers, facility costs and other costs related to these indirect functions. Other income and expenses Other income and expenses primarily consists of interest income, interest expense, other income, net and interest and other expense associated with claim on long-term contract. Interest income primarily consists of interest earned on U.S. government money market funds. Interest expense consists of interest expense incurred under our Senior Notes and Credit Agreement. Other income, net primarily consists of gain or loss on sale of assets, sublease income and transaction gain or loss related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. With regard to the MTA Lawsuit, during the second half of fiscal 2013, a California state court issued a number of preliminary judgments with the final judgment being rendered in early fiscal 2014 in favor of the plaintiff in a lawsuit against a joint venture in which we were the managing partner and the only other partner was bankrupt. We recorded a loss of $98.8 million for fiscal 2013 as a result of these judgments, which included the reversal of $55.1 million in previously recognized revenue. For each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, we recorded post-judgment interest of $9.3 million in (Interest and other expense) gain associated with claim on long-term contract in our consolidated statements of income (loss). In addition, for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, we recorded other expenses of $0.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in Interest and other expense associated with claim on long-term contract. $129.9 million was accrued for this matter in Provision for contract losses on our consolidated balance sheet as of fiscal 2017 year-end. Post judgment interest was accrued through May 2018 when a total of $133.1 million was accrued in Provision for contract losses of consolidated joint ventures on our consolidated balance sheet. On February 28, 2018, the California Court of Appeals vacated the judgement, and in doing so, the appellate court remanded the case to the trial court for the sole purpose of entering a new and final judgement in our favor. On April 9, 2018, the appellate court ruling was appealed by the counterparty to the California Supreme Court. On June 13, 2018, the California Supreme Court denied the counterpartys appeal. As a result, in the second quarter of 2018 we reversed $133.1 million accrued in Provision for contract losses on consolidated joint ventures on our consolidated balance sheet, resulting in a net gain of $129.7 million on our consolidated statements of income, of which $55.1 million was recorded as an increase in revenue with the remainder recorded as other income. 72 Table of Contents Year ended December 29, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2018 The following table sets forth our results of operations for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 as a percentage of revenue.

See Segment Results below for further discussion. Direct costs of contracts Fiscal Year Ended Variance (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 29, 2017 December 31, 2018 Dollar Percent Direct costs of contracts $ 2,400,140 $ 2,795,005 $ 394,865 16.5 % Direct cost of contracts increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase of $327.3 million in our Federal Solutions segment. This increase was in part due to the acquisitions of Polaris Alpha, which added $174.0 million, and Williams Electric, which was acquired October 6, 2017 and added a net increase of $20.5 million. The remaining increase in our direct costs of contracts in Federal Solutions was due to the ramp up of certain projects in our Defense business line, as well as growth on existing contracts in our Defense, Engineered Systems and Mission Solutions business lines. Direct cost of contracts in our Critical Infrastructure segment increased $67.6 million primarily due to a proportionate increase in Critical Infrastructure revenue. 73 Table of Contents Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures Fiscal Year Ended Variance (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 29, 2017 December 31, 2018 Dollar Percent Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures $ 40,086 $ 36,915 $ (3,171 ) (7.9 )% Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the timing of the completion of joint ventures and the starting of new joint ventures as part of ordinary course timing fluctuations in our business. Indirect, general and administrative expenses Fiscal Year Ended Variance (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 29, 2017 December 31, 2018 Dollar Percent Indirect, general and administrative expenses $ 506,255 $ 597,410 $ 91,155 18.0 % Indirect, general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to our Federal Solutions segment, most of which is related to additional expenses of $35.0 million from Polaris Alpha, $32.3 million from the amortization of intangible assets related to the Polaris Alpha and Williams Electric acquisitions and $6.2 million in acquisition-related expenses. In our Critical Infrastructure segment, expenses in fiscal 2018 were substantially unchanged from fiscal 2017.

Interest expense increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase in debt in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. This increase in debt was primarily related to the Polaris Alpha acquisition. The amounts in other income (expense), net, are primarily related to $5.2 million in net transaction losses on movements in foreign currency rates offset in part by $4.1 million in sublease income. See Results of OperationsOther income and expenses above for an explanation of the $74.6 million recorded in Gain associated with claim on long term contract in fiscal 2018 related to the MTA Lawsuit. Income tax expense Fiscal Year Ended Variance (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 29, 2017 December 31, 2018 Dollar Percent Income tax expense $ 21,464 $ 20,367 $ (1,097 ) 5.1 % 74 Table of Contents Income tax expense decreased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the impact of our change in jurisdictional earnings mix from higher to lower tax jurisdictions, partially offset by the impact of the increase in overall pre-tax earnings subject to taxation. Historically, we have recognized income taxes as an S Corporation for federal and state income tax purposes and, therefore, with the exception of a limited number of state and local jurisdictions, our income has not been subject to income taxes. In connection with this offering, we will convert to a C Corporation. On a pro forma basis, if we had been taxed as a C Corporation at an assumed combined federal, state, local and foreign effective income tax rate of 28.77%, our income tax expense in fiscal 2018 would have been $70.2 million. Year ended December 30, 2016 compared to year ended December 29, 2017 The following table sets forth our results of operations for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 as a percentage of revenue.

See Segment Results below for further discussion. 75 Table of Contents Direct costs of contracts Fiscal Year Ended Variance (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 30, 2016 December 29, 2017 Dollar Percent Direct costs of contracts $ 2,431,193 $ 2,400,140 $ (31,053 ) (1.3 )% Direct costs of contracts decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to a decrease of $27.3 million in our Critical Infrastructure segment attributable to a $35.3 million decrease in Critical Infrastructure revenue in fiscal 2017. In our Federal Solutions segment, direct cost of contracts decreased $3.7 million primarily due to changes in the amount of work performed in various business lines and the finalization of Engineered Systems work on a U.S. Department of Energy project, which resulted in a $8.7 million decrease in pass-through material costs. See Segment Results below for further discussion.

Indirect, general and administrative expenses Fiscal Year Ended Variance (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 30, 2016 December 29, 2017 Dollar Percent Indirect, general and administrative expenses $ 522,920 $ 506,255 $ (16,665 ) (3.2 )% Indirect, general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to $12.4 million of restructuring expenses recognized in fiscal 2016 and no restructuring expenses recognized in fiscal 2017. Our restructuring actions included involuntary terminations and exiting operations in certain geographical regions. Indirect, general and administrative expenses also decreased in fiscal 2017 due to reduced administrative expenses obtained from our 2016 restructuring program to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs, which was fully implemented by the end of fiscal 2016. Impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets Fiscal Year Ended Variance (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 30, 2016 December 29, 2017 Dollar Percent Impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets $ 85,133 $  $ (85,133 ) n/a In fiscal 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $85.1 million associated with goodwill, intangible and other assets related to a Critical Infrastructure reporting unit.

Interest expense decreased because fiscal 2017 had one less week of operation compared to fiscal 2016 and there was a one-time interest expense charge of $0.3 million in fiscal 2016 that did not recur in fiscal 2017. The amounts in other income, net are primarily related to transaction gains or losses on movements in foreign currency rates. Interest and other expense associated with a claim on a long-term contract increased primarily due to payment of a performance bond related to the MTA Judgment, which was later vacated in fiscal 2018. Income tax expense Fiscal Year Ended Variance (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 30, 2016 December 29, 2017 Dollar Percent Income tax expense $ 13,992 $ 21,464 $ 7,472 53.4 % Income tax expense increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to increased pre-tax net income in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Pre-tax net income in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate increased $14.4 million from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. Historically, we have recognized income taxes as an S Corporation for federal and state income tax purposes and therefore, with the exception of a limited number of state and local jurisdictions, we have not been subject to income taxes. In connection with the consummation of this initial public offering, we will convert to a C Corporation. Segment Results We evaluate segment operating performance using segment revenue and segment Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation is Adjusted EBITDA excluding Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. See Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data for a discussion of our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, how we use this metric, why we present this metric and the material limitations on usefulness of this metric. See Note 20Segments Information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for further discussion regarding our segment Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation. 77 Table of Contents The following table shows Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation for each of our reportable segments and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests: Fiscal Year Ended (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 30, 2016 December 29, 2017 December 31, 2018 Federal Solutions Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation $ 79,376 $ 89,269 $ 114,571 Critical Infrastructure Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation 81,206 86,471 97,779 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests 12,570 14,891 17,407 Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 173,152 $ 190,631 $ 229,757 Year ended December 29, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2018 Federal Solutions Fiscal Year Ended Variance (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 29, 2017 December 31, 2018 Dollar Percent Revenue $ 1,079,906 $ 1,479,007 $ 399,101 37.0 % Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation 89,269 114,571 25,302 28.3 % The increase in Federal Solutions revenue was primarily due to the acquisition of Polaris Alpha, which added $227.4 million of revenue since its acquisition date of May 31, 2018, and a $27.5 million net increase from Williams Electric business, which we acquired in October 2017. Federal Solutions legacy revenue increased $144.2 million primarily due to an increase of $119.7 million, or 38.4%, in our Engineered Systems business line, a $12.7 million, or 4.4%, increase in our Defense business line and a $7.5 million increase, or 2.7%, in our Mission Solutions business line. Federal Solutions Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation increased primarily due to the acquisitions of Polaris Alpha, which contributed $18.4 million, and Williams Electric, which contributed $6.2 million. Critical Infrastructure (U.S. dollars in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended Variance December 29, 2017 December 31, 2018 Dollar Percent Revenue $ 1,937,105 $ 2,081,501 $ 144,396 7.5 % Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation 86,471 97,779 11,308 13.1 % The increase in Critical Infrastructure revenue was primarily related to the Mobility Solutions business line with an overall increase of $81.1 million (inclusive of $55.1 million related to the favorable resolution of the MTA Lawsuit), or 7.4%, with an increase of $38.3 million in the Middle East and a decrease of $12.3 million in North America, excluding the MTA Lawsuit. The Connected Communities business line increased $53.5 million, or 8.9%, from fiscal 2017, nearly all of which was a result of growth in the Middle East. The Industrial business line showed more modest growth overall with a $9.7 million, or 4.2%, increase from fiscal 2017. 78 Table of Contents The increase in Critical Infrastructure Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation was primarily related to an increase in revenue of $89.3 million, offset in part by $67.6 million in direct cost of contracts, a change in other income and expense of $8.0 million, primarily related to foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and a $2.3 million increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Year ended December 30, 2016 compared to year ended December 29, 2017 Federal Solutions Fiscal Year Ended Variance (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 30, 2016 December 29, 2017 Dollar Percent Revenue $ 1,066,740 $ 1,079,906 $ 13,166 1.2 % Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation 79,376 89,269 9,893 12.5 % The increase in Federal Solutions revenue in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in revenues in our Cyber & Intelligence business line of $42.7 million, or 30.0%, and our Mission Solutions business line of $7.5 million, or 2.6%, driven by new awards, an increase in the scope of existing contracts and new IDIQ task awards, which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $28.0 million, or 8.2%, in our Engineered Systems business line and $9.0 million, or 3.0%, in our Defense business line due to delays in awards in fiscal 2017. The increase in Federal Solutions Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the increase in revenue of $13.2 million and a decrease in our direct cost of contracts of $3.7 million, primarily due to the finalization of a large program in our Engineered Systems business line, offset by a $6.0 million increase in our indirect, general and administrative expenses primarily due to an increase in corporate costs allocated to Federal Solutions as a result of an increase in Federal Solutions corporate allocation base. Critical Infrastructure Fiscal Year Ended Variance (in thousands) December 30, 2016 December 29, 2017 Dollar Percent Revenue $ 1,972,451 $ 1,937,105 $ (35,346 ) (1.8 )% Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation 81,206 86,471 5,265 6.5 % The decrease in Critical Infrastructure revenue in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in revenue in our Industrial business line of $96.4 million, or 29.4%, which was primarily driven by a decrease in business volume due to lower oil prices in fiscal 2017, which in turn delayed investment by our customers and negatively impacted demand for our services in both North America and the Middle East. Revenue in our Mobility Solutions business line decreased $4.4 million, or 0.4% million primarily from a combination of a reduction of revenue in the Middle East of $24.1 million as a result of the factors described above for our Industrial business line, offset by growth in the North America market of $19.7 million primarily due to an increase in design-build programs. Revenue in our Connected Communities business line increased by $65.4 million, or 12.2%, primarily driven by positive train control projects and other rail systems programs in the United States and built environment programs in the Middle East. 79 Table of Contents The increase in Critical Infrastructure Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in direct costs of contracts of $27.4 million, an increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures of $4.7 million, reduced indirect, general and administrative expenses of $5.7 million obtained from our 2016 restructuring, and an increase in other income of $5.1 million, offset by a decrease in revenue of $35.3 million and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $2.2 million. Quarterly Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2018. The information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus and, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the results of operations for these periods in accordance with GAAP.

Fiscal 2018 includes a $0.6 million loss related to several individually insignificant items that are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual in nature. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures and satisfied redemptions of ESOP interests through a combination of internally generated cash from operations, our Senior Notes and from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Generally, cash provided by operating activities has been adequate to fund our operations. Due to fluctuations in our cash flows and growth in our operations, it may be necessary from time to time in the future to borrow under our Credit Agreement to meet cash demands. Our management regularly monitors certain liquidity measures to monitor performance. We calculate our available liquidity as a sum of cash and cash equivalents from our consolidated balance sheet plus the amount available and unutilized on our Credit Agreement. We believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations, pay the IPO Dividend, support our debt service and support our ongoing acquisition strategy for the next twelve months based on the liquidity from cash provided by our operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand and our borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility. 81 Table of Contents By selling shares of our common stock to the public in this offering, we will be able to expand ownership in our stock, gain access to the public capital markets, use shares of our common stock to satisfy redemptions of ESOP interests and repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness. From time to time we will evaluate alternative uses for excess cash resources, including funding acquisitions or repurchasing outstanding shares of common stock. Debt Senior Notes On July 1, 2014, we completed a private placement of senior notes, or Senior Notes, in the aggregate amount of $250,000,000 with the following principal terms: Tranche Principal Debt Amount Maturity Date Interest Rate Senior Note, Series A $ 50,000,000 July 15, 2021 4.44 % Senior Note, Series B 100,000,000 July 15, 2024 4.98 Senior Note, Series C 60,000,000 July 15, 2026 5.13 Senior Note, Series D 40,000,000 July 15, 2029 5.38 We made interest payments of $12.4 million during fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 with respect to our Senior Notes. Each of the Senior Notes may be redeemed in full or in part at our option at a redemption premium equal to the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments with respect to the amount of the Senior Note that is being prepaid over the amount of such Senior Note that is being prepaid. The Senior Notes contain certain covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, engage in transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with another person, sell assets, or incur liens. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2018. Revolving Credit Facility In November 2013, we entered into the Credit Agreement with respect to our Revolving Credit Facility, which was amended and restated in November 2017. The Credit Agreement consists of (i) a revolving credit facility, allowing for borrowings of up to $550.0 million, and (ii) commercial and financial letters of credit available for issuance of up to $100.0 million. The maturity date for borrowings under the Credit Agreement is November 15, 2022. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin, or LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for Base Rate loans is a range of 0.125% to 1.00% and the applicable margin for LIBOR loans is a range of 1.125% to 2.00%, both based on our leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2018, the applicable interest rate under the Credit Agreement was 4.253%. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our operating subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, we had $180.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and $49.8 million of letters of credit outstanding, and in January 2019, we borrowed an additional $110.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility to partially finance the OGSystems Acquisition. The Credit Agreement includes various covenants, including restrictions on indebtedness, liens, acquisitions, investments or dispositions, payment of dividends and maintenance of certain financial ratios and conditions. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2018. We intend to use $ million of our net proceeds from this offering to 82 Table of Contents repay the outstanding balance under our Revolving Credit Facility upon the consummation of this offering. Term Loan In January 2019, we borrowed $150.0 million under our Term Loan Agreement to partially finance the OGSystems Acquisition. Our Term Loan is comprised of Offshore Rate Loans and Base Rate Loans (each as defined in the Term Loan Agreement), with an initial aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million. The Offshore Rate Loans bear interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR, divided by 1.00 minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage, plus 1.25%. The Base Rate Loans bear interest at a rate per annum of the sum of (a) the highest of (1) the administrative agents reference rate; (2) the rate equal to 1.50% per annum above the Offshore Rate; and (3) the rate equal to 0.50% per annum above the latest federal funds rate, plus (b) 0.25%. The Term Loan has a maturity date of January 3, 2020. We intend to use $ million of our net proceeds from this offering to repay the outstanding balance under our Term Loan upon the consummation of this offering and cancel the Term Loan Agreement. Letters of Credit We also have in place several secondary bank credit lines for issuing letters of credit, principally for foreign contracts, to support performance and completion guarantees. Letters of credit commitments outstanding under these bank lines aggregated $223.0 million as of December 31, 2018, including $49.8 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Cash Flows Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of revenue recognized, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customers. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including whether the contract type is cost-plus, time-and-materials, or fixed-price contracts. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-plus and time-and-materials contracts, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. In contrast, we may be limited to bill certain fixed-price contracts only when specified milestones, including deliveries, are achieved. A number of our contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash prior to completing the work. Accounts receivable is the principal component of our working capital and is generally driven by revenue growth. Accounts receivable reflects amounts billed to our clients as of each balance sheet date and receivable amounts that are currently due but unbilled. The total amount of our accounts receivable can vary significantly over time, but is generally sensitive to revenue levels. Net days sales outstanding, which we refer to as net DSO, is calculated by dividing (i) accounts receivable (net of project accruals, billings in excess of revenue and accounts payable) by (ii) average revenue per day (calculated by dividing trailing twelve months revenue by the number of days in that period). In the last few years we have focused on collecting outstanding receivables to reduce Net DSO and working capital. Net DSO was 74 days at December 30, 2016, 68 days at December 29, 2017 and 52 days at December 31, 2018. Our working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $570.4 at December 30, 2016, $554.2 at December 29, 2017 and $482.6 at December 31, 2018. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by $164.9 million to $281.2 million at December 31, 2018 from $446.1 million at December 29, 2017. This compares to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $53.1 million from $393.0 million at December 30, 2016 to $446.1 million at December 29, 2017. 83 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash over the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended (in thousands) December 30, 2016 December 29, 2017 December 28, 2018 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 198,559 $ 265,029 $ 284,634 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (29,302 ) (52,961 ) (503,295 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (185,217 ) (160,171 ) 55,411 Effect of exchange rate changes (1,200 ) 1,235 (1,699 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (17,160 ) $ 53,132 $ (164,949 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities consist primarily of net income (loss) adjusted for noncash items, such as: equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures, contributions of treasury stock, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets, provisions for doubtful accounts, amortization of deferred gains, and impairment charges. The timing between the conversion of our billed and unbilled receivables into cash from our customers and disbursements to our employees and vendors is the primary driver of changes in our working capital. Our operating cash flows are primarily affected by our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner, our ability to manage our vendor payments and the overall profitability of our contracts. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $19.6 million to $284.6 million during fiscal 2018 compared to $265.0 million during fiscal 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a change in other long-term liabilities of $12.8 million, primarily related to our insurance reserves, and a $38.5 million increase in net income after adjusting for non-cash items. These positive changes in operating cash flows were offset, in part, by a $33.1 million change in the use of cash related to our working capital accounts. Notwithstanding the decrease in cash flows from our working capital accounts, net DSOs decreased from 68 days to 52 days primarily driven by the increase in our business volume. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $66.5 million to $265.0 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $198.6 million during fiscal 2016. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a $32.2 million improvement in cash flows from our working capital accounts driven by a decrease in net DSOs from 74 days to 68 days, a change in other long-term liabilities of $10.8 million, primarily related to our long-term incentive plans, a change in income taxes of $5.3 million, and a $18.2 million increase in net income after adjusting for non-cash items. Investing Activities Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities consists primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures and business acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities increased $450.3 million from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018, primarily due to the use of $481.2 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Polaris Alpha in fiscal 2018 compared to $25.7 million, net of cash acquired, in fiscal 2017 for the acquisition of Williams Electric Company. Net cash used in investing activities increased $23.7 million from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017, primarily due to the use of $25.7 million, net of cash acquired, in fiscal 2017 for the acquisition of Williams Electric Company. We had no significant business acquisitions in fiscal 2016. 84 Table of Contents Financing Activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities is primarily associated with proceeds from debt, the repayment thereof, distributions to noncontrolling interests and payments to the ESOP in connection with the redemption of ESOP participants interests. We spent $148.7 million in fiscal 2016, $111.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $125.8 million in fiscal 2018 in connection with the redemption of ESOP participants interests. With a public market for the Companys common stock, cash will no longer be required for ESOP redemptions following the 180-day lock-up period. Net cash provided by financing activities increased $215.6 million from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase in borrowings under our Credit Agreement of $180.0 million, net of $80.0 million of repayments, and a decrease in distributions to noncontrolling interest of $45.7 million. These cash flows provided by financing activities were offset, in part, by an increase of $14.4 million in the purchases of our common stock, related to redemptions of ESOP interests in fiscal 2018 compared to redemptions in fiscal 2017. Net cash used in financing activities decreased $25.0 million from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017, primarily due to a $37.3 million reduction in the purchases of our common stock, related to redemptions of ESOP interests in fiscal 2017 compared to redemptions in fiscal 2016. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations that require us to make future cash payments as of December 31, 2018. For contractual obligations, we included payments that we have an unconditional obligation to make. In the normal course of business, we enter into agreements with subcontractors and vendors to provide products and services that we consume in our operations or that are delivered to our clients. These products and services are not considered unconditional obligations until the products and services are actually delivered, at which time we record a liability for our obligation.

Management makes estimates and judgments in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and the revenues and expenses reported for the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Although such estimates and assumptions are based on information available through the date of the issuance of our consolidated financial statements, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are evaluated periodically and adjusted accordingly. We believe that the following items are the most critical accounting policies and estimates that involved significant judgment as we prepared our financial statements. We consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if the policy or estimate requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Revenue Recognition and Cost Estimation In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , (ASC 606), which provides a single comprehensive accounting standard for revenue recognition for contracts with customers and supersedes current industry-specific guidance, including Accounting Standards Codification 605-35, or ASC 605-35. The new standard requires companies to recognize revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods or services. The new model requires companies to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time for each of these obligations. The new standard also significantly expands disclosure requirements regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. On December 30, 2017, the Company adopted ASC 606, using the modified retrospective method, which provides for a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings beginning in fiscal 2018 for those uncompleted contracts impacted by the adoption of the new standard. The difference between the recognition criteria under ASC-606 and our previous recognition practices under ASC 605-35 was recognized through a cumulative adjustment of $4.7 million that was made to the opening balance sheet of accumulated deficit as of December 30, 2017. The cumulative effect of adopting ASC 606 was primarily due to combining certain deliverables that were previously considered separate deliverables into a single performance obligation and the transition of certain cost-type contracts into the cost-to-cost measure of progress method. Consistent with the modified retrospective transition approach, the comparative fiscal 2016 and 2017 periods were not adjusted to conform to the current period presentation. The following are the significant policies and practices as applied to our business. In our industry, recognition of revenue and profit on long-term contracts requires the use of assumptions and estimates related to total contract revenue, total cost at completion, and the measurement of progress towards completion. Estimates are continually evaluated as work progresses and are revised when necessary. When a change in estimate is determined to have an impact on contract revenue or profit, we record a positive or negative adjustment to the statement of income (loss). A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in ASC 606. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each 86 Table of Contents distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. To the extent a contract is deemed to have multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. We determine the relative standalone selling price utilizing observable prices for the sale of the underlying goods or services. Contracts are considered to have a single performance obligation if the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts or is not distinct in the context of the contract, which is mainly because we provide a significant service of integrating a complex set of tasks and components into a single project or capability. Engineering and construction contracts are generally accounted for as a single performance obligation, while our engineering and construction supervision contracts are accounted for as two separate performance obligations. Customers are generally billed as we satisfy our performance obligations and payment terms typically range from 30 to 120 days from the invoice date. Billings under certain fixed-price contracts may be based upon the achievement of specified milestones, while some arrangements may require advance customer payment. Our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The transaction price for our contracts may include variable consideration, which includes increases to the transaction price for approved and unpriced change orders, claims and incentives and reductions to transaction price for liquidated damages. We recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catch-up method. Under this method, the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the total loss in the quarter it is identified. Claims revenue is related to amounts in excess of agreed contract price that we seek to collect from clients or others for customer-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both price and scope, or other causes of unanticipated additional contract costs, including factors outside of our control, where we therefore believe we are entitled to additional compensation. Claims revenue, when recorded, is only recorded to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We include certain unapproved claims in the transaction price when the claims are legally enforceable, we consider collection to be probable and believe we can reliably estimate the ultimate value. We continue to engage in negotiations with our customers on our outstanding claims. However, these claims may be resolved at amounts that differ from our current estimates, which could result in increases or decreases in future estimated contract profits or losses. Costs related to claims are recognized when they are incurred. Change orders, which are a normal and recurring part of our business are generally not distinct and are accounted for as part of the existing contract. The effect of a change order that is not distinct on the transaction price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis. To the extent change orders included in the transaction price are not resolved in our favor, there could be reductions in, or reversals of previously reported amounts of, revenues and profits, and charges against current earnings. Costs relating to change orders are recognized when they are incurred. We recognize revenue for most of our contracts over time as performance obligations are satisfied, as we are continuously transferring control to the customer. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using an input measure (i.e. costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion) to measure progress. We often enter into contracts in which the amount billed to the customer corresponds directly with the amount of work performed. These contract types qualify for the right to invoice practical expedient 87 Table of Contents method of measuring progress, in which the right to consideration corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date. For these contracts, revenue is recognized in the amount that we have the right to invoice. Provisions for anticipated losses on contracts, including those arising from disputes and other contingencies, are recorded in the period such loss becomes known; provisions not ultimately required are released as disputes or contingencies are resolved. Contract costs include labor and materials, amounts payable to subcontractors, direct overhead costs and equipment expense (primarily depreciation, fuel, maintenance and repairs). All contract costs are recorded as incurred. Changes to estimated contract costs, either due to unexpected events or revisions to managements initial estimates, for a given project are recognized in the period in which they are determined as estimated at the contract level. See  Components of Results of OperationsRevenue above for additional information. Business Combinations The cost of an acquired company is assigned to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires us to make estimates and use valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and obligations assumed is allocated to goodwill. Goodwill typically represents the value paid for the assembled workforce and enhancement of our service offerings. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test. Interim testing for impairment is performed if indicators of potential impairment exist. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may decide to first perform a qualitative assessment, or step zero impairment test, to determine whether it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeds their carrying amounts, we perform a quantitative assessment and calculate the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment. In the second step, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized. Our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, including the significance of the excess of our estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments, and the date of the applicable acquisitions, if any. We perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis as of the end of November for each reporting unit that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding industry economic factors and future profitability. In fiscal 2016, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $84.7 million in fiscal 2016 associated with goodwill and intangible assets related to a Critical Infrastructure reporting unit. For the years ended December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, we performed a quantitative analysis for all of our reporting units. It was determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values. As a result, no goodwill impairments were identified for those periods. 88 Table of Contents The goodwill impairment test involves determination of the fair value of our reporting units. This process requires significant judgments and estimates, including assumptions about our strategic plans for operations as well as the interpretation of current economic indicators. Development of the present value of future cash flow projections includes assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our expected revenue growth rates, profit margins, business plans, cost of capital and tax rates. We also make certain assumptions about future market conditions, market prices, interest rates and changes in business strategies. Changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit. This could eliminate the excess of fair value over carrying value of a reporting unit entirely and, in some cases, result in impairment. Such changes in assumptions could be caused by a loss of one or more significant contracts, reductions in government or commercial client spending, or a decline in the demand for our services due to changing economic conditions. In the event that we determine that our goodwill is impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash charge that could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. We use the Income Approach to determine the fair value of reporting units. The Income Approach utilizes the discounted cash flow method, which focuses on the expected cash flow of the reporting unit. In applying this approach, the cash flow is calculated for a finite period of years. Beyond the finite period, a terminal value is developed using a sustainable long-term annual growth rate estimate. Then the finite period cash flows and the terminal value are discounted to present value to arrive at an indication of fair value. We utilized internal financial projections through fiscal 2021. Intangible assets with finite lives arise from business acquisitions and are amortized based on the period over which the contractual or economic benefit of the intangible assets are expected to be realized or on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the underlying assets, ranging from one to ten years. These primarily consist of customer relationships, backlog, and covenants not to compete. We assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indicators of impairment are present based on expected future profitability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to overall operations. Should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the intangible assets would be recognized as an impairment loss. Consolidation of Joint Ventures and Variable Interest Entities We participate in joint ventures, which include partnerships and partially-owned limited liability corporations, to bid, negotiate and complete specific projects. We are required to consolidate these joint ventures if we hold the majority voting interest or if we meet the criteria under the consolidation model as described below. A variable interest entity, or VIE, is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack the ability to make certain decisions, the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive expected residual returns; or (c) an equity investor has voting rights that are disproportionate to its economic interest and substantially all of the entitys activities are on behalf of the investor with disproportionately low voting rights. Our VIEs may be funded through contributions, loans and/or advances from the joint venture partners or by advances and/or letters of credit provided by clients. Certain VIEs are directly governed, managed, operated and administered by the joint venture partners. Others have no employees and, although these entities own and hold the contracts with the clients, the services required by the contracts are typically performed by the joint venture partners or by other subcontractors. We are required to perform an analysis to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of our VIEs. We are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if we have (i) the power to direct the 89 Table of Contents activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Many of the joint ventures we enter into are deemed to be VIEs because they lack sufficient equity to finance the activities of the joint venture. We use a qualitative approach to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, which considers factors that indicate a party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the joint ventures economic performance. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, significant assumptions and judgments include the following: (1) identifying the significant activities and the parties that have the power to direct them; (2) reviewing the governing board composition and participation ratio; (3) determining the equity, profit and loss ratio; (4) determining the management-sharing ratio; (5) reviewing employment terms, including which joint venture partner provides the project manager; and (6) reviewing the funding and operating agreements. We analyze each joint venture initially to determine if it should be consolidated or unconsolidated into our financial statements:  A joint venture is consolidated into our financial statements if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, or hold the majority of voting interests of a non-VIE (and no significant participative rights are available to the other partners).  A joint venture is not consolidated into our financial statements if we are not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, or do not hold the majority of voting interest of a non-VIE. We account for our unconsolidated joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, we recognize our proportionate share of the net earnings of these joint ventures as Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of its investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities is typically limited to the aggregate of the carrying value of the investment and future funding commitments in these entities. ESOP We contribute shares of our own stock to the ESOP each year. Shares held by the ESOP or committed to be contributed to the ESOP are presented as temporary equity as they include a cash redemption feature that is not solely within our control. Throughout the year, as employee services are rendered, we record compensation expense based on salaries of eligible employees. Contributions of our common stock to the ESOP are made annually in amounts determined by our board of directors and are held in trust for the sole benefit of the participants. Shares allocated to a participants account are fully vested after six years of credited service, or in the event(s) of reaching age 65, death or disability while an active employee. Upon certain events, including retirement, death, termination due to permanent disability, a severe financial hardship following termination of employment, certain conflicts of interest following termination of employment, or the exercise of diversification rights, participants interests in their ESOP accounts are redeemable at the current price per share of the stock. Prior to the completion of this offering, such per share prices were established by the ESOP Trustee, taking into account, among other things, the advice of a third party valuation consultant for the ESOP Trustee as well as the ESOP Trustees knowledge of the Company, as of the end of the plan year preceding distribution. Prior to the completion of this offering, under the terms of the ESOP, we are obligated to redeem eligible participants interests in their ESOP accounts for cash upon an eligible participants election. We present all shares held by the ESOP as temporary equity on the consolidated balance sheet at their redemption value based on the share price as of the end of the preceding plan year. Beginning on the 181 st day following the date of this prospectus, distributions from the ESOP will be made in our common stock (other than distributions in respect of fractional shares, which will be made in cash, 90 Table of Contents based on the then-current market value of our common stock). Upon receiving a distribution of our common stock from the ESOP, a participant will be able to sell such shares of common stock in the market, subject to any requirements of the federal securities laws. During the 180-day lock-up period, any qualifying distribution elections made by participants will be paid in cash using proceeds from the IPO Dividend. If the IPO Dividend is not sufficient to satisfy all qualifying distribution elections owed to participants during the 180-day lock-up period, the ESOP Trustee will have the right to cause us to purchase shares in order to allow the ESOP Trustee to pay participants in cash. To the extent there are proceeds from the IPO Dividend that were not used to satisfy distributions during the 180-day lock-up period, such remaining proceeds will be reinvested in our common stock on or before December 31, 2019. Valuation of Common Stock Prior to this offering, our share price was determined using a combination of income and market based methods that utilize unobservable Level 3 inputs, including significant assumptions such as forecasted revenue and operating margins, working capital requirements and weighted average cost of capital. Given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, for all purposes related to the fair market value of our common stock, we have historically used the per share price of our common stock as established by the ESOP Trustee, taking into account, among other things, the advice of a third party valuation consultant for the ESOP Trustee as well as the ESOP Trustees knowledge of the Company, as of December 31 for each calendar year. Self-Insurance We are self-insured for a portion of our losses and liabilities primarily associated with workers compensation, general, professional, automobile, employee matters, certain medical plans, and project specific liability claims. Losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience and certain actuarial assumptions, as provided by an independent actuary. The estimate of self-insurance liability includes an estimate of incurred but not reported claims, based on data compiled from historical experience. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See the information set forth in Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2018, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risks related to both the Revolving Credit Facility and our Term Loan Agreement. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either (i) the Base Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) plus an applicable margin or (ii) LIBOR 91 Table of Contents plus an applicable margin. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $180.0 million. Based on the $180.0 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the Base Rate and/or LIBOR rates would result in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense of approximately $1.8 million. Borrowing under our Term Loan is comprised of Offshore Rate Loans and Base Rate Loans (each as defined in the Term Loan Agreement), with an initial aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million. The Offshore Rate Loans bear interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR, divided by 1.00 minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage, plus 1.25%. The Base Rate Loans bear interest at a rate per annum of the sum of (a) the highest of (1) the administrative agents reference rate; (2) the rate equal to 1.50% per annum above the Offshore Rate; and (3) the rate equal to 0.50% per annum above the latest federal funds rate, plus (b) 0.25%. Based on the $150.0 million outstanding principal balance under the Term Loan, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the Term Loans applicable interest rate would result in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense of approximately $1.5 million. The Term Loan has a maturity date of January 3, 2020 and we intend to use proceeds from this offering to pay off the full outstanding balance under the Term Loan. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from our operations outside of the U.S. We limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of our contracts through provisions that require client payments in currencies corresponding to the currency in which costs are incurred. As a result of this natural hedge, we generally do not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed. Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to certain claims and assessments that arise in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, Parsons has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injuries as a result of contact with asbestos products at various project sites. We believe that any significant costs relating to these claims will be reimbursed by applicable insurance and do not expect any of these claims to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management judgment is required to determine the outcome and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Management believes that there are no claims or assessments outstanding which would materially affect our consolidated results of operations or our financial position. 92 Table of Contents BUSINESS Overview We are a leading provider of technology-driven solutions in the defense, intelligence and critical infrastructure markets.

Our Market Opportunities Technological progress is driving a swift pace of change, resulting in ongoing societal transformation, complicated geopolitical dynamics, a shifting threat landscape and the globalization of commerce. To address this evolving landscape, our customers are actively seeking technology-enabled solutions to upgrade and transform assets and operations. The below trends are key drivers of activity and growth in both our Federal Solutions and Critical Infrastructure segments. Defense Spending Remains a Key Focus of the national agenda due to the reemergence of long-term strategic competition, which has been cited in the National Defense Strategy as the primary concern for U.S. national prosperity and security. This reemergence has resulted in increased global disorder and a security environment, defined by rapid technological change, which may be more complex than ever before. In September 2018, the President signed the U.S. Department of Defense appropriations bill, which approved a 2019 U.S. Department of Defense budget of $606.5 billion (an increase of almost 15.8% from the 2017 U.S. Department of Defense budget $523.5 billion). We believe the U.S. Department of Defense will continue to invest in space and cyberspace as warfighting domains, C5ISR, missile defense, advanced autonomous systems and resilient and agile logistics. For example, U.S. federal government spending on space and missile research and development is expected to grow from $10.5 billion in 2018 to $12.1 billion in 2021 according to Bloomberg Government, representing a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 4.8% between 2018 and 2021. Cybersecurity is Mission Critical to U.S. National Security and cybersecurity threats are increasing in volume and sophistication as global connectivity and the rise of social media have led to an explosion in the amount of available and exploitable data. The Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates that threats from hacks, cyber criminals, foreign governments, malicious insiders 99 Table of Contents and corporate espionage have a $600 billion annual global cost impact. The proliferation of mobile devices, smart devices and cloud computing has vastly increased the need for enterprise-wide risk-based cybersecurity programs and governments have become increasingly aware of the need for a proactive approach to the risk of cyber-attacks. U.S. Department of Defense cybersecurity and cloud obligations were estimated at $4.7 billion in 2018 and are on pace to reach approximately $6.6 billion in 2021 according to Bloomberg Government, representing a CAGR of approximately 12% between 2018 and 2021. We believe that this market will continue to grow in response to the shifting threat landscape. Consistent Need for Actionable Intelligence to Support U.S. Priorities is driving a shifting threat landscape that necessitates a greater need for collaboration and cooperation between intelligence agencies. There is a new demand for multi-domain command and control systems that are not designed for one particular warfighting domain, but are instead optimized to function cohesively across a spectrum of domains. This in turn drives a need for sophisticated data analytics to parse data into useful formats in real-time. To respond, we believe the United States intelligence community will need continued focus on information sharing and collaboration for improved intelligence accuracy and timeliness encompassing multiple forms of intelligence collection. The United States intelligence communitys 2019 budget is approximately $81 billion and has grown at approximately a 5% CAGR since 2017. Global Infrastructure Needs Significant Replacements and Technology-Driven Upgrades. Aging physical infrastructure is strained by the swift pace of technological change. This strain has driven a mobility solutions market that was $712.4 billion in 2018 and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of more than 7% between 2018 and 2021, according to Fitch Solutions, Inc., based on the estimated growth of the total global airports, roads and bridges and rail infrastructure markets. Critical infrastructure, specifically transportation infrastructure that is essential to national economic and security concerns including airports, bridges, and rail and transit systems, is particularly vulnerable. While U.S. federal government spending on infrastructure and environment is estimated to contract by 2.0% from U.S. federal government fiscal years 2018 through 2021, U.S. federal government obligations for structures and civil infrastructure is expected to grow from approximately $50.1 billion in fiscal 2018 to approximately $66.6 billion in U.S. federal government fiscal 2021, according to Bloomberg Government. We believe aging infrastructure will continue to be replaced and supplanted by newer, smarter infrastructure with an increased focus on connectivity. Urbanization Creates Demand for Smart Cities with Connected Populations. Cities around the globe increasingly demand new capabilities, such as sensor networks and communication strategies to connect streetlights, security cameras and emergency systems, to provide important real-time information and better serve their citizens. The connected communities market was estimated at $921 million in U.S. federal government fiscal year 2018 and is estimated to grow at 10.7% from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2021, according to Bloomberg Government. Better integrated corridor management solutions, intelligent transportation systems, advanced rail systems and updated telecommunication networks will keep cities around the world functioning as smart cities and serve as engines for economic growth. Disruption of Legacy Service Delivery Models from Technology. Historical capital project management is changing with the introduction of cloud-connected computer-aided design, automation, big data, machine learning and other technologies.

Demonstrated Ability to Identify and Execute Acquisitions to Transform our Business Strategic acquisitions that augment our technology offerings and capabilities are a key tenet of our growth strategy. We have completed five strategic acquisitions (four in Federal Solutions and one in Critical Infrastructure) since 2011, which collectively provided us with a wide variety of complementary technology capabilities, with an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion. This 102 Table of Contents highlights our ability to successfully identify and execute on attractive opportunities to augment our leading technical offerings. These acquisitions include:  OGSystems : Acquired in 2019, OGSystems is a disruptive geo-intelligence solutions and immersive engineering provider that creates technology solutions for the United States intelligence community and the Department of Defense.

We maintain a robust acquisition pipeline and are continually evaluating potential opportunities for disciplined growth by acquisition to further transform our business. Our Strategy for Growth Our growth strategy is focused on three pillars: Enhance, Extend and Transform. These include continually enhancing and optimizing our core business processes, extending our core business into high-growth and opportunity-rich adjacent markets and acquiring and integrating companies that possess transformative and disruptive technologies. Enhance and Optimize our Core Operations We are committed to enhancing and optimizing our core business and improving financial performance, including revenue growth, margin expansion and positive cash flow, using the following strategies:  Maintaining high re-compete rates.  Focusing on cross-selling a wide range of applicable services and solutions to our customers, including those added to our portfolio through acquisition.  Continuing research and development investments in cybersecurity software, iNET, our intelligent transportation system connected city platform, modeling and simulation, data analytics and our software and security-as-a-service platforms.  Developing intellectual property and product offering from our investments.  Streamlining operations and processes to optimize overhead expenditures. 103 Table of Contents  Increasing our presence and prime contractor positions on large omnibus IDIQ and Master Service Agreement contracts.  Expanding our talent pool in key strategic areas outside of high-employment zones.  Continuously evaluating and shaping our portfolio to divest, exit and de-emphasize lower-performing businesses and markets.  Rigorously managing our working capital to maximize cash flow. Extend into Opportunity-Rich Adjacent Markets We are extending our core markets through organically penetrating and expanding in market adjacencies requiring our core services and solutions. The characteristics of these markets encompass development, design and delivery of software and services leveraging cybersecurity, data analytics, cloud computing and Internet of Things applications with growth rates and margins that are on par or higher than our core. Our key market focuses include:  SpaceExtend our space situational awareness, small satellite integration, command and control and critical infrastructure solutions to our current space customers (MDA, Air Force, Space & Missile Command, NASA and NRO) and to new space customers in the government and commercial space markets.  EnergyExtend our cyber-physical security, energy efficiency, owners engineer, and critical infrastructure solutions to regulated utilities, oil and gas energy companies and federal energy customers.  HealthExtend our data analytics, artificial intelligence and cloud computing solutions to the federal disease research and greater federal healthcare ecosystem.  Smart CitiesExtend our iNET platform to include enhanced cybersecurity, data analytics, machine learning, and cloud computing to expand coverage to additional global cities and regions.  Critical Infrastructure ProtectionLeverage our installed customer base and pursue market segments that are driven by high threat levels and regulatory concerns, so that we are positioned to implement our Domain6 cybersecurity toolset into the health, energy, government and industry facilities and transportation sectors. This strategy extends the reach of our people, customer relationships and intellectual property to capture growing demand in the five market adjacencies. These markets demand information systems that are safe and secure, scalable, reliable, interoperable and mobile. In assessing potential areas of expansion or entry into adjacent markets, we maintain a strictly disciplined approach, always placing paramount importance on responsible growth in areas aligned with our strategy and core competencies. Continued Acquisition and Integration of Transformative, Disruptive Technologies We are transforming our business capabilities and business models through the acquisition of companies with additional software and hardware intellectual property in:  Cybersecurity software leveraging artificial intelligence algorithms across large data sets to further expand our coverage with large infrastructure and mobility systems.  Intelligence software focused on data capture, processing and configuration to produce actionable intelligence from large data sets. 104 Table of Contents  IoT sensor systems integration, data capture and processing focused on mobility solutions for connected and smart cities.  Space and geospatial software to expand our small satellite command and control coverage, large data capture and analysis with embedded artificial intelligence to improve space operations. Our objective is to continue to transform our business into a highly-scalable defense and infrastructure platform and increase revenue growth rates, margins and cash flows. Our acquisition strategy is focused on gaining additional intellectual property, resources and expertise to:  Increase the portion of our portfolio dedicated to software development and sales.  Sell more of our solutions through transactional and subscription business models, leveraging our expertise developed over the past 20 years in vehicle inspection.  Leverage our strong balance sheet and free cash flow to fund this strategy. We seek to expand opportunities for long-term revenue growth, both by developing and acquiring capabilities that will allow us to reach new customers and by expanding our offerings for existing customers. We build on the foundation of our Enhance and Extend strategies and reinforce these strategies with acquisitions of companies with software, hardware and expertise in our target markets, services and solutions. Backlog We view growth in total backlog as a key measure of our business growth. We define backlog to include the following two components:  FundedFunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts.  UnfundedUnfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts. Backlog includes (i) unissued delivery orders and unexercised option years, to the extent their issuance or exercise is probable, as well as (ii) contract awards, to the extent we believe contract execution and funding is probable. Our backlog includes orders under contracts that in some cases extend for several years. For example, the U.S. Congress generally appropriates funds for our U.S. federal government customers on a yearly basis, even though their contracts with us may call for performance that is expected to take a number of years to complete. As a result, our federal contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term and all or some of the work to be performed under the contracts may remain unfunded unless and until the U.S. Congress makes subsequent appropriations and the procuring agency allocates funding to the contract. As of December 31, 2018, our total backlog was $8.0 billion, consisting of $5.3 billion of funded backlog and $2.7 billion of unfunded backlog. We expect to recognize $2.6 billion of our funded backlog at December 31, 2018 as revenues in the following twelve months. However, our government customers may cancel their contracts with us at any time through a termination for convenience or may elect to not exercise option periods under such contracts. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would not receive anticipated future revenues, but would generally be permitted to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed. 105 Table of Contents Competition The industries we operate in consist of a large number of enterprises ranging from small, niche-oriented companies to multi-billion dollar corporations that serve many government and commercial customers. We compete on the basis of our technical expertise, technological innovation, our ability to deliver cost-effective multi-faceted services in a timely manner, our reputation and relationships with our customers, qualified and/or security-clearance personnel, and pricing. Our main competitors in Federal Solutions are U.S. federal systems integrators and service providers such as CACI International Inc, Leidos Holdings, Inc., Science Applications International Corporation, Booz Allen Hamilton, CSRA Inc., The Raytheon Company, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Perspecta Inc. and ManTech International Corporation. Our main competitors in Critical Infrastructure include Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and Tetra Tech, Inc., as well as Siemens AG and Cisco Systems, Inc. in the connected communities market. Large defense firms or technology companies may develop products or services in the future that could compete with us. Seasonality Our results may be affected by variances as a result of seasonality we experience across our businesses. This pattern is typically driven by the U.S. federal government fiscal year-end, September 30. While not certain, it is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of the U.S. federal government fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended U.S. federal government fiscal year funds. In addition, we have also historically experienced higher bid and proposal costs in the months leading up to the U.S. federal government fiscal year-end as we pursue new contract opportunities expected to be awarded early in the following U.S. federal government fiscal year as a result of funding appropriated for that U.S. federal government fiscal year. Furthermore, many U.S. state governments with fiscal years ending on June 30 tend to accelerate spending during their first quarter, when new funding becomes available. We may continue to experience this seasonality in future periods, and our results of operations may be affected by it. Employees As of January 31, 2019, we had 15,633 employees. We employ more than 11,712 degreed employees and over 3,196 highly credentialed employees, including those with registrations and certifications in technical areas like agile methodology, project management, registered engineering, architecture, technology & security. As of January 31, 2019, approximately 21.0% of our employees held security clearances and approximately 16.0% of our employees with security clearances held a Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information-level clearance, which often requires the completion of a polygraph. In addition, our executive management has an average tenure of 17 years with the company and over 32 years of industry or functional experience. As of January 31, 2019, approximately 330 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We continue to focus on our firm-wide hiring program to recruit and attract additional high quality and experienced talent and maintain close relationships with key academic institutions globally, which allows us to identify and target leading minds in key fields of study relevant to our business. We believe that our employee relations are good. Properties Our headquarters are located in Centreville, Virginia. As of December 31, 2018, we leased 202 commercial facilities (including our headquarters) with an aggregate of approximately 2.8 million 106 Table of Contents square feet of space across 35 U.S. states and 18 countries used in connection with the various services rendered to our customers. Additionally, we operate at several customer-accredited Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, which are highly-specialized, secure facilities used to perform classified work for the United States intelligence community. We also have employees working at customer sites throughout the U.S. and in other countries. We believe our facilities are adequate for our current and presently foreseeable needs. Intellectual Property Our intellectual property portfolio consists of issued and pending patents as well as trademarks for many of our technologies. In addition, we maintain a number of trade secrets that we endeavor to protect to ensure their continuing availability to us. Our technical expertise is vital to our growth strategy, and we believe they are a core competitive advantage. We rely upon a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements, as well as copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary information. We also enter into proprietary information and intellectual property agreements with employees, which require them to disclose any inventions created during employment, to convey such rights to inventions to us and to restrict any disclosure of proprietary information. While protecting trade secrets and proprietary information is important, we are not materially dependent on maintenance of any specific trade secret or group of trade secrets. During the normal course of business, we perform research and development and technology consulting services and related products in support of our customers. Typically these services do not depend on patent protection. In accordance with applicable law, our government contracts often provide government agencies certain license rights to our inventions, copyrights and other intellectual property. Government agencies may in turn sublicense to other contractors (including our competitors) the right to utilize our intellectual property. In addition, in the case of our work as a subcontractor, our prime contractor may also have certain rights to data, information and products we develop under the subcontract. At the same time, our government contracts often license to us patents, copyrights and other intellectual property owned by third parties. Regulation Our business is impacted by government procurement, anti-bribery, international trade, environmental, health and safety and other regulations and requirements. Below is a summary of some of the significant regulations that impact our business. Government Procurement . The services we provide to the U.S. Government are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, or CAS, the Services Contract Act, the False Claims Act, export controls rules and U.S. Department of Defense security regulations, as well as many other laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. A violation of specific laws and regulations could lead to fines, contract termination or suspension of future contracts. Generally, our government clients can also terminate, renegotiate, or modify any of their contracts with us at their convenience; and many of our government contracts are subject to renewal or extension annually. Anti-Bribery and other regulations. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. 107 Table of Contents The U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. In addition, an organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the U.K. Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery. International Trade . We are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, and the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, as well as U.S. economic and trade sanctions, including those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. To the extent we export items and provide services outside of the United States (or to certain parties in the United States), we must do so in compliance with these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose export licensing requirements, and we may not be successful in obtaining necessary licenses and other authorizations. Further, these laws and regulations restrict our ability to export items or provide services to certain countries and certain persons, including those that are the target of OFAC sanctions. Noncompliance with these or similar laws could lead to government investigations, penalties, reputational harm, and other negative consequences, and thereby could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, any change in these laws and regulations, or any shift in the approach to their enforcement or scope, or change to the countries, persons, or items targeted by such regulations, could potentially result in our decreased ability to export or sell items or services to existing or potential customers. Environmental, Health and Safety. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety matters, including, among other things, the handling, transport and disposal of regulated substances and wastes, including hazardous and radioactive materials; contamination by regulated substances and wastes; the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; the acquisition of a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities; the maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees, state and local government authorities and the public; and employee health and safety. Our previous ownership and current and previous operation of real property may subject us to liability pursuant to these laws or regulations. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and related state laws, certain persons may be liable at sites where or from a release or threatened release of hazardous substances has occurred or is threatened. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where a release or threatened release occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the release occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under CERCLA is strict, retroactive and, under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, regulates the generation, treatment, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of solid waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. Under RCRA, persons may be liable at sites where the past or present storage, handling, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where disposal occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the disposal occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under RCRA is strict and, under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances. Violations and liabilities with respect to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could result in significant administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups, natural resource damages, permit modifications or revocations, 108 Table of Contents operational interruptions or shutdowns and other liabilities. Additionally, Congress, state legislatures, local governing bodies and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes could result in more stringent or costly requirements for our operations. Our costs related to complying with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations have not been material in the past and are not currently material to our total operating costs or cash flows. However, if we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations in the future, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, in the unlikely event that we are required to fund remediation of a contaminated site, the statutory framework might allow us to pursue rights of contribution from other potentially responsible parties. We maintain a compliance program designed to ensure compliance with the various regulations and requirements applicable to us. The compliance program, managed by our Chief Ethics and Compliance Counsel and overseen by our Chief Compliance Officer, includes an annual audit of performance with respect to our codes of ethics and business conduct and the adequacy of our compliance program, among other initiatives. Legal Proceedings Our performance under our contracts and our compliance with the terms of those contracts and applicable laws and regulations are subject to continuous audit, review and investigation by our customers, including the U.S. federal government. In addition, we are from time to time involved in legal proceedings and investigations arising in the ordinary course of business, including those relating to employment matters, relationships with clients and contractors, intellectual property disputes, environmental matters and other business matters. Although the outcome of any such matter is inherently uncertain and may be materially adverse, based on current information, except as noted below, we believe there are no pending lawsuits or claims that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. On or about March 1, 2017, the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board, or the JPB, filed a lawsuit against Parsons Transportation Group, Inc., or PTG, in the Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo, in connection with a positive train control project on which PTG was engaged prior to termination of its contract by the JPB. PTG had previously filed a lawsuit against the JPB for breach of contract and wrongful termination. The JPB seeks damages in excess of $100.0 million, which we are currently disputing. In addition to filing our complaint for breach of contract and wrongful termination, we have denied the allegations raised by the JPB and, accordingly, filed affirmative defenses. We are currently defending against the JPBs claims and the parties are still engaged in discovery. We also have a professional liability insurance policy to the extent the JPB proves any errors or omissions occurred. At this time, it is too soon to determine the outcome of the litigation or assess the potential range of exposure, if any. We have also filed a third party claim against a subcontractor for indemnification in connection with this matter. 109 Table of Contents In September 2015, a former Parsons employee filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama against us as a qui tam relator on behalf of the United States (the Relator) alleging violation of the False Claims Act. The plaintiff alleges that, as a result of these actions, the United States paid in excess of $1 million per month between February and September 2006 that it should have paid to another contractor, plus $2.9 million to acquire vehicles for the contractor defendant to perform its security services. The lawsuit sought (i) that we cease and desist from violating the False Claims Act, (ii) monetary damages equal to three times the amount of damages that the United States has sustained because of our alleged violations, plus a civil penalty of not less than $5,500 and not more than $11,000 for each alleged violation of the False Claims Act, (iii) monetary damages equal to the maximum amount allowed pursuant to §3730(d) of the False Claims Act, and (iv) Relators costs for this action, including recovery of attorneys fees and costs incurred in the lawsuit. The United States government did not intervene in this matter as it is allowed to do so under the statute. We filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that the Relator did not meet the applicable statute of limitations. The District Court granted our motion to dismiss. The Relators attorney appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals of the Eleventh Circuit, which ultimately ruled in favor of the Relator, and we petitioned the United States Supreme Court to review the decision. The Supreme Court accepted the petition and the case was heard on March 19, 2019. At this time, it is too soon to determine the outcome of the litigation or assess the potential range of exposure, if any, and a ruling is not expected until the second quarter of 2019. 110 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT Executive Officers and Directors The following table sets forth information regarding our executive officers and directors, as of January 31, 2019: Name Age Position(s) Executive Officers Charles L.

Board Composition Our bylaws that will become effective upon the closing of this offering provide that our board of directors shall consist of nine members. Currently, our board of directors consists of nine members: Mmes. Lundgren and Vautrinot and Messrs. Dahlberg, Harrington, Holdsworth, Leer, McGovern, McMahon and Mitchell. 114 Table of Contents In accordance with our certificate of incorporation that will be in effect upon the closing of this offering, our board of directors will be divided into three classes with staggered three year terms. At each annual meeting of stockholders after the initial classification, the successors to the directors whose terms will then expire will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election. Our directors will be divided among the three classes as follows:  the Class I directors will be Tamara L. Lundgren, James F. McGovern and Harry T. McMahon, and their terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2020;  the Class II directors will be Mark K. Holdsworth, Steven F. Leer and M. Christian Mitchell, and their terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2021; and  the Class III directors will be Kenneth C. Dahlberg, Charles L. Harrington and Major General Suzanne M. Vautrinot, USAF (ret), and their terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2022. Any increase or decrease in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of the directors. This classification of our board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control of our company. Our board of directors has determined that upon completion of this offering, Mmes. Lundgren and Vautrinot and Messrs. Dahlberg, Holdsworth, Leer, McGovern, McMahon and Mitchell will be independent directors. In making this determination, our board of directors applied the NYSE listing standards and Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. In evaluating the independence of Mmes. Lundgren and Vautrinot and Messrs. Dahlberg, Holdsworth, Leer, McGovern, McMahon and Mitchell, our board of directors considered their current and historical employment, any compensation we have given to them, any transactions we have with them, their beneficial ownership of our capital stock, their ability to exert control over us, all other material relationships they have had with us and the same facts with respect to their immediate family. The board of directors also considered all other relevant facts and circumstances known to it in making this independence determination. In addition, Mmes. Lundgren and Vautrinot and Messrs. Dahlberg, Holdsworth, Leer, McGovern, McMahon and Mitchell are non-employee directors, as defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. Both the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the board of directors seek the talents and backgrounds that would be most helpful to Parsons in selecting director nominees. In particular, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, when recommending director candidates to the full board of directors for nomination, may consider whether a director candidate, if elected, assists in achieving a mix of board members that represents a diversity of background and experience. In addition, our corporate governance guidelines that will become effective upon the closing of this offering provide that a director shall retire from our Board at the next annual meeting of stockholders after he or she has reached the age of 75. Board Leadership Structure Our board of directors recognizes that one of its key responsibilities is to evaluate and determine its optimal leadership structure so as to provide effective oversight of management. Our bylaws and corporate governance guidelines provide our board of directors with flexibility to combine or separate the positions of chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer. Our board of directors currently believes that our existing leadership structure is effective, provides the appropriate balance of authority between independent and non-independent directors, and achieves the optimal governance model for us and for our stockholders. 115 Table of Contents Mr. Harrington serves as our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the board of directors. Our board of directors believes that Mr. Harringtons services as Chairman of the board of directors, Chief Executive Officer and President is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. Mr. Harrington possesses detailed and in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities and challenges we face and is thus best positioned to develop agendas that ensure that the board of directors time and attention are focused on the most critical matters. Specifically, his combined role enables decisive leadership, ensures clear accountability, and enhances our ability to communicate our message and strategy clearly and consistently to our stockholders, employees, customers and manufacturers. Our corporate governance guidelines provide that we have a lead independent director. Our lead independent director is James F. McGovern. In that role, he calls meetings of the independent directors and chairs such meetings, including all executive sessions of the board of directors, facilitates communications between our Chairman and the independent directors of the board of directors, and reviews the quantity, quality and timeliness of information provided to the board of directors, among other duties described in our corporate governance guidelines. Board Oversight of Risk Although management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks our company faces, our board of directors and its committees take an active role in overseeing the management of our risks and bear the ultimate responsibility for of risk management. The board of directors regularly reviews information regarding our operational, financial, legal and strategic risks. Specifically, senior management attends quarterly meetings of the board of directors, provides presentations on operations including significant risks, and is available to address any questions or concerns raised by our board of directors. In addition, we expect that our four board of directors committees will assist the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk. The Audit Committee will coordinate the board of directors oversight of our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, related party transactions and code of conduct and corporate governance guidelines and management will regularly report to the Audit Committee on these areas. The Compensation Committee will assist the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risks arising from our compensation policies and programs as well as succession planning as it relates to our Chief Executive Officer. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will assist the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risks associated with board organization, membership and structure, succession planning for our directors and corporate governance. The Executive Committee will assist the board of directors in conducting its duties, including meeting with greater frequency than the board of directors in connection with key actions to be taken by us, such as major acquisitions, divestitures, mergers or changes in capital structure or ownership, in addition to meeting on an ad hoc basis in order to review major investments or divestitures outside of our normal investment plan. When any of the committees receives a report related to material risk oversight, the chairman of the relevant committee will report on the discussion to the full board of directors. Codes of Conduct and Ethics We have adopted written codes of conduct and ethics that apply to our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, and to third parties with whom we conduct business, including agents, representatives, joint venture partners, consultants and subcontractors. We 116 Table of Contents have posted current copies of these codes on our website, www.parsons.com. In addition, we intend to post on our website all disclosures that are required by law or NYSE listing standards concerning any amendments to, or waivers from, any provision of the codes. Controlled Company Exception After giving effect to this offering, the ESOP will continue to control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, under our certificate of incorporation, the ESOP will be able to nominate a majority of the total number of directors comprising our board of directors and we will remain a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards. As a controlled company, exemptions under the NYSE standards will mean that we are not required to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the following requirements: (1) that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors; (2) that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities; (3) that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities, and (4) for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees. Although we intend to comply with these listing requirements whether or not we are a controlled company, there is no guarantee that we will not take advantage of these exemptions in the future. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements. Board Committees Following this offering, we anticipate that we will have the following board of directors committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and an Executive Committee. The anticipated composition and responsibilities of each committee are described below. Members will serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by our board of directors. Audit Committee Our audit committee oversees our corporate accounting and financial reporting process. Among other matters, the audit committee:  appoints our independent registered public accounting firm;  evaluates the independent registered public accounting firms qualifications, independence and performance;  determines the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm;  reviews and approves the scope of the annual audit and the audit fee;  discusses with management and the independent registered public accounting firm the results of the annual audit and the review of our quarterly financial statements;  approves the retention of the independent registered public accounting firm to perform any proposed permissible non-audit services; 117 Table of Contents  monitors the rotation of partners of the independent registered public accounting firm on our engagement team in accordance with requirements established by the SEC;  reviews our financial statements and our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to be included in our annual and quarterly reports to be filed with the SEC;  reviews our critical accounting policies and estimates; and  at least annually, reviews the audit committee charter and reviews and evaluates the performance of the audit committee and its members, including compliance by the audit committee with its charter. After this offering, we expect that the members of our audit committee will be Mr. Mitchell (chairperson), Mr. Leer, Mr. Dahlberg, Mr. McMahon and Ms. Vautrinot. All members of our audit committee meet the requirements for financial literacy under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE. Our board of directors has determined that M. Christian Mitchell is an audit committee financial expert as defined under the applicable rules of the SEC and has the requisite financial sophistication as defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the NYSE. Under the rules of the SEC, members of the audit committee must also meet heightened independence standards. However, a minority of the members of the audit committee may be exempt from the heightened audit committee independence standards for one year from the date of effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Our board of directors has also determined that each of the members are independent under the heightened audit committee independence standards of the SEC and the NYSE. As allowed under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE, we intend to phase in compliance with the heightened audit committee independence requirements prior to the end of the one-year transition period. The audit committee operates under a written charter that satisfies the applicable standards of the SEC and the NYSE. Compensation Committee Our compensation committee reviews and recommends policies relating to compensation and benefits of our officers and employees. Among other matters, the compensation committee:  reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives relevant to compensation of our chief executive officer and other executive officers;  evaluates the performance of these officers in light of those goals and objectives, and approves the compensation of these officers based on such evaluations;  approves the issuance of stock options and other awards under our long-term incentive plans, other than awards to non-employee members of our board of directors; and  at least annually, reviews the compensation committee charter and reviews and evaluates the performance of the compensation committee and its members, including compliance by the compensation committee with its charter. After this offering, we expect that the members of our compensation committee will be Ms. Lundgren (chairperson), Mr. Dahlberg, Mr. Leer and Mr. McMahon. Our board of directors has determined that each of the members of our compensation committee is independent under the applicable rules and regulations of the NYSE and is a non-employee director as defined in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The compensation committee operates under a written charter that satisfies the applicable standards of the SEC and the NYSE. 118 Table of Contents Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee The nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for making recommendations to our board of directors regarding candidates for directorships and the size and composition of our board of directors. In addition, the nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for overseeing our corporate governance policies and reporting and making recommendations to our board of directors concerning governance matters. The nominating and corporate governance committee will also, at least annually, review its committee charter and review and evaluate the performance of the nominating and corporate governance committee and its members, including compliance by the committee with its charter. After this offering, we expect that the members of our nominating and corporate governance committee will be Mr. Holdsworth (chairperson), Ms. Vautrinot, Mr. McGovern and Mr. Mitchell. Our board of directors has determined that each of the members of our nominating and corporate governance committee is an independent director under the applicable rules and regulations of the NYSE relating to nominating and corporate governance committee independence. The nominating and corporate governance committee operates under a written charter that satisfies the applicable standards of the SEC and the NYSE. Executive Committee The executive committee is responsible for providing our board of directors with considerations and recommendations regarding our business strategy. In addition, among other matters, the executive committee is responsible for reviewing key actions to be taken by us, such as major mergers, acquisitions, major investments or divestitures of assets outside our normal investment plans, and conducting periodic reviews of the executive committees performance, assessing the adequacy of its charter and recommending changes to the board of directors. The executive committee is authorized with all the powers of the board of directors, except for powers specifically denied by the executive committee charter, including, but not limited to, declaring or paying dividends, amending our bylaws or articles of incorporation, issuing stock and making or approving capital expenditures exceeding $5.0 million. After this offering, we expect that the members of our executive committee will be Mr. Harrington (chairperson), Mr. McGovern, Mr. Holdsworth, Ms. Lundgren and Mr. Mitchell. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation During fiscal 2018, the members of our compensation committee were Ms. Lundgren, Mr. Dahlberg, Mr. Leer and Mr. McMahon. No member of our compensation committee is or has been a current or former officer or employee of Parsons or had any related person transaction involving Parsons. None of our executive officers served as a director or a member of a compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity, one of whose executive officers served as a director or member of Parsons compensation committee during fiscal 2018. Limitation on Liability and Indemnification Matters Our certificate of incorporation that will become effective immediately prior to the consummation of this offering, contains provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Consequently, our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for:  any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;  any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; 119 Table of Contents  unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or  any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that will become effective immediately prior to the consummation of this offering, provide that we are required to indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Our bylaws will also provide that we are obligated to advance expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or proceeding, and permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in that capacity regardless of whether we would otherwise be permitted to indemnify him or her under Delaware law. We have entered and expect to continue to enter into agreements to indemnify our directors, executive officers and other employees as determined by our board of directors. With specified exceptions, these agreements provide for indemnification for related expenses including, among other things, attorneys fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these individuals in any action or proceeding. We believe that these certificate of incorporation and bylaw provisions and indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers. We also maintain directors and officers liability insurance. The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and officers for breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and our stockholders. Further, a stockholders investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage. Director Compensation See Executive CompensationElements of Executive CompensationDirector Compensation for information regarding compensation for members of our board of directors. 120 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Compensation Discussion and Analysis The following discussion and analysis of compensation arrangements of our named executive officers, or NEOs should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures set forth below. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current plans, considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation programs. The actual amount and form of compensation and the compensation programs that we adopt may differ materially from currently planned programs as summarized in this discussion. This section discusses the principles underlying our executive compensation policies and decisions and the most important factors relevant to an analysis of these policies and decisions. In addition, we explain how and why our board of directors and the Compensation Committee of our board of directors arrived at specific compensation policies and decisions involving our NEOs during fiscal 2018. This Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides information about the material components of our executive compensation program for the following executive officers, to whom we refer collectively in this prospectus as the NEOs for fiscal 2018.  Charles L. Harrington, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Director;  George L. Ball, Chief Financial Officer;  Carey A. Smith, Chief Operating Officer;  Michael W. Johnson, Chief Development Officer (resigned in January 2019); and  Michael R. Kolloway, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary 121 Table of Contents Executive Summary Chart How we performed in fiscal 2018  Awards increased in fiscal 2018 by $1.2 billion, or 42%, from fiscal 2017 due an increase in awards generated from each of our two segments and the impact of Polaris Alpha.  Performance revenue increased in fiscal 2018 by $478 million, or 17%, from fiscal 2017 due to improved performance by each of our two segments and the impact of Polaris Alpha.  Net operating income increased in fiscal 2018 by $39 million, or 25%, from fiscal 2017 due to improved performance by each our two segments and the impact of Polaris Alpha.  Net DSOs decreased in fiscal 2018 by 16 days, or 15%, from fiscal 2017 as a result of our concerted efforts to collect outstanding receivables. How we determine pay  Review market compensation levels and program design to provide a frame of reference for comparison.  Design pay programs to reward executives for positive company performance and align with employee beneficial stockholder interests by having a significant portion of compensation composed of performance-based and long-term incentive awards.  Set competitive pay levels and incentive compensation commensurate with market, performance and the need to retain executive officers of outstanding ability and potential.  Consider relevant qualitative factors, in addition to the advice of the Compensation Committees independent compensation consultant. How we pay our NEOs  Base salaries reflect each NEOs role, responsibility and experience.  Annual target incentive awards based on a mix of financial objectives (90%) and qualitative individual objectives (10%).  Long-term incentives granted at target levels using a portfolio of awards, including a performance-based award with a three-year cliff vest, in which 50% is based on cumulative awards and 50% is based on net operating income. How we address risk and governance  Provide an appropriate balance of short- and long-term compensation, with payouts based on the Companys achievement of certain objective financial metrics and specific business area objectives.  Follow practices that promote good governance and serve the interests of our employee beneficial stockholders, with maximum payout caps for annual cash incentives and long-term performance awards. 122 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Philosophy We believe in providing a competitive total compensation package to our NEOs through a combination of base salary, performance-based incentive awards, long-term incentive awards and broad-based welfare and health benefit plans. Our executive compensation program is designed to achieve the following objectives:  attract, motivate and retain executive officers of outstanding ability and potential, whose knowledge, skills and performance are critical to our success;  reward the achievement of short-term and long-term strategic goals, and  ensure that executive compensation is meaningfully related to the creation of employee beneficial shareholder value. Executive Compensation Design As a privately held company, our executive compensation program, which covers our NEOs, consists of a combination of base salary, short-term cash bonus opportunities and long-term incentives through the use of phantom equity that is designed to reward performance that meets or exceeds expectations. Phantom equity is compensation that is linked to our share price, but generally is paid in cash. Our NEOs are also entitled to certain employee benefits that are available to all of our employees, and limited perquisites. We have structured our short-term incentive opportunities to focus on the achievement of specific annual financial objectives that will further our longer-term growth objectives. We use our long-term incentive compensation to provide incentives for our executive officers to focus on the growth of our overall enterprise value and, correspondingly, to create value for our employee beneficial stockholders. We believe that long-term incentive compensation in the form of phantom equity, which is linked to our share price, aligns our executive officers interests with the long-term interests of our employee beneficial stockholders. Going forward, we plan to continue having long-term incentive awards tied to our equity value, but to have such awards paid in the form of our common stock. Executive Compensation Setting Process Role of the Compensation Committee . Our board of directors delegated to the Compensation Committee the responsibility for overseeing, reviewing, and approving our compensation arrangements and benefit plans and policies. In addition, the Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves or recommends to the board of directors for its approval of our NEO compensation program. Historically, the Compensation Committee, reviewed each component and the aggregate level of compensation, as well as a mix of additional relevant factors outlined in the Use of Comparative Market Data and Qualitative Factors below, in setting compensation for our NEOs. We used private market data, and in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, a combination of private market data and public company peer data, in part, to assess the competitiveness, reasonableness and appropriateness of individual executive compensation elements and of our overall NEO compensation packages. Role of Executive Officers . The CEO, as a member of our board, attends board of director and Compensation Committee meetings and actively participates in determining our executive compensation philosophy, design, incentive target amounts, and incentive payouts. Our finance department works with our Chief Human Resources Officer and CEO to gather financial and operational data that the CEO reviews in making his recommendations. From time to time our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal Officer attend meetings (or portions thereof) of the board of directors 123 Table of Contents to present information and answer questions pertaining to our executive compensation structure. No executive officer, including our CEO, participates directly in the final determinations regarding his or her own compensation. While the Compensation Committee considers these recommendations in its deliberations, it exercises its own independent judgment in approving the final compensation of our NEOs. Role of Compensation Consultant. Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC, or Pearl Meyer, a national compensation consulting firm, has assisted the Compensation Committee in developing our CEO compensation program for 2018. Among other things, the Compensation Committee directed Pearl Meyer to provide its analysis of whether our existing compensation strategy and practices were consistent with our compensation objectives and to assist us in modifying our compensation program for our CEO to better achieve our objectives. As part of its duties, Pearl Meyer has performed the following projects for the Compensation Committee:  assisted in the development of a compensation peer group composed of public companies in similar industries with revenues comparable to us;  provided compensation data for similarly-situated CEOs at our peer group companies; and  updated the Compensation Committee on emerging trends and best practices in the area of executive compensation. The Compensation Committee has evaluated Pearl Meyers independence pursuant to the requirements of the NYSE and the factors set forth in the SEC rules and has determined that Pearl Meyer is independent and no conflict of interest has arisen as a result of the work performed by Pearl Meyer. Assessing Compensation Competitiveness For our NEOs, other than our CEO, our Compensation Committee has used private survey data relating to the compensation practices of other companies within and outside our industry as a reference source, in addition to other relevant factors, in determining our executives compensation. Typically, our Compensation Committee applied its independent judgment to make compensation decisions and did not formally benchmark our executive compensation against any particular group of companies or use a formula to set our NEOs, other than the CEOs, compensation in relation to this data. The Compensation Committee did, however, use a combination of private company survey data and public company peer data relating to the compensation practices as a reference source in determining CEO compensation. The following public company peer group was used as a reference source in its 2018 CEO compensation deliberations: AECOM Leidos Holdings, Inc CACI International Inc ManTech International Corporation Engility Holdings, Inc Stantec, Inc Fluor Corporation Tetra Tech, Inc Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc WSP Global Inc In connection with its engagement with Pearl Meyer in 2018, the Compensation Committee directed Pearl Meyer to develop a compensation peer group to assist in developing a compensation program for all of our NEOs for 2019. Pearl Meyer provided the Compensation Committee with a recommended list of peer companies from the engineering and construction, aerospace and defense, 124 Table of Contents environmental and facilities services and research and consulting services industries that Pearl Meyer and the Compensation Committee determined compete with us for talent as they are in the same or related industries. We also considered the revenue, operating income, net income, cash flow and debt to income ratio level of these companies and determined that a compensation peer group consisting of companies with levels both above and below our own levels was appropriate. Our Compensation Committee believed that including companies with higher revenue and income levels than ours was appropriate due to our historical and recent strong growth. In October 2018, our Compensation Committee reviewed the following companies as the peer group to be used as a reference source in its 2019 executive compensation deliberations: AECOM Leidos Holdings, Inc Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation ManTech International Corporation CACI International Inc Perspecta Inc Cubic Corporation Science Applications International Corporation Engility Holdings, Inc Stantec, Inc Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc Tetra Tech, Inc KBR, Inc WSP Global Inc Going forward, the Compensation Committee intends to review the peer group at least annually and make adjustments to its composition as necessary. Use of Comparative Market Data and Qualitative Factors Our Compensation Committee has reviewed each component of executive compensation separately and also taken into consideration the value of each named executive officers compensation package as a whole and its relative size in comparison to our other executive officers, with the goal to set all elements of compensation within a competitive range, using a balanced approach that does not use rigid percentiles to target pay levels, but instead makes its compensation decisions based on a variety of relevant factors. While the Compensation Committee believes that information regarding the compensation practices at other companies is useful in assessing the competitiveness, reasonableness and appropriateness of individual executive compensation elements and of our overall executive compensation packages, this information is only one of several factors that our Compensation Committee considers. Other factors that are considered include: Recruitment and retention: The Compensation Committee reviews existing named executive officer compensation and retention levels relative to the competitive labor market pressures and likely estimated replacement cost with respect to the scope, responsibilities and skills required of the particular position. Lack of directly comparable data for some of our key roles : Compensation data for some of our named executive officer roles may not be explicitly reported by companies in our compensation peer group or survey data. This results in limited sample sizes and/or inconclusive data that can be misleading if targeting a specific percentile for market positioning. Market positioning may be distorted by the source of the data: Certain elements of compensation reported from one source can be consistently higher or lower than the data collected from another, given differences in methods and samples used by each source to collect market data. Given this variability and volatility within the market data, the Compensation Committee has determined that targeting pay levels at specific percentiles of this data could result in outcomes that do not align with the internal value and strategic importance of various roles at Parsons. 125 Table of Contents Relevant Qualitative Factors: A range of subjective and qualitative factors is considered, including:  The role the named executive officer plays and the importance of such individuals contributions to our ability to execute on our business strategy and to achieve our strategic objectives;  Each executive officers tenure, skills and experience;  The responsibilities and particular nature of the functions performed or managed by the named executive officer;  Our CEOs recommendations and his assessment of each executive officers performance (other than his own performance), and with respect to the CEOs performance, assessment by the board of directors; and  Internal pay equity across the executive management team. As we transition from a privately-held company to a publicly-traded company, we will evaluate our philosophy and compensation programs as circumstances require. At a minimum, we will review executive compensation annually. As part of this review process, we expect to apply our values and the objectives outlined above, while considering the compensation levels needed to ensure our executive compensation program remains competitive. We will also review whether we are meeting our pay for performance, and key employee retention objectives. Elements of Executive Compensation Elements At a Glance The compensation program for our NEOs consists of the following three principal components: Base Salary Provides competitive fixed compensation levels to attract and retain highly qualified talent  Base salary increases are tied to performance in the role and growth of the Company  Executives anticipated responsibilities, experience, qualifications, performance, competitive market compensation paid by other companies for similar positions within the industry, internal pay equity among our NEOs and negotiations with the executive are all considered  No specific formulas applied Short-term incentive: Performance-based annual cash bonus Encourages focus on achievement of the Companys annual financial plan, as well as the specific qualitative goals included in the Companys strategic plan  The annual incentive awards are completely at-risk, depending on the level of performance against the criteria  Financial performance metrics: performance revenue, net operating income and cash flow (90% of total weighting) set at the beginning of each fiscal year. Metrics vary by individual based on responsibilities  Individual contribution goals based on objective performance metrics that also allow the Compensation Committee to use judgment in considering qualitative performance factors (10% of total weighting)  Range of annual incentive target as a percent of base salary is 75% to 125%  Payment may range from 0% to 150% of target based on actual performance 126 Table of Contents Long-term incentive: Long Term Growth Units Rewards achievement of performance related to the Companys long-term objectives and employee beneficial shareholder value creation  33% of total long-term incentive value awarded as long-term growth unit awards  Performance criteria are 50% based on cumulative contract award value and 50% based on net operating income  Payouts may range from 0% to 150% of target based on actual performance achieved over the three-year performance period  Three-year cliff vesting at end of performance period  Each long term growth unit earned represents the equivalent of one share of our stock. As such, the final payout value depends on achievement of the performance criteria and the price of our common stock at the end of the three years Long-term incentive: Shareholder Value Units  33% of total long-term incentive value in the form of share value units, which are dependent upon the growth in the value of our shares over a three-year period  Three-year cliff vesting period  Each share value unit pays the difference between the price of our common stock at the end of the three year period over the price at the beginning of the period. Accordingly, the Share Value Units are completely at-risk, attaining value only if our common stock valuation grows over the three-year period  No share value units were or will be granted in 2019 Long-term incentive: Restricted Award Units  33% of total long-term incentive value awarded takes the form of restricted award units, which upon vesting are converted into a cash amount equal in value to a share of common stock on such vesting date, as long as the individual remains an employee through the vesting period  The value of the restricted award unit is at-risk, increasing or decreasing with our common stock valuation over the vesting period  Three-year cliff vesting period 127 Table of Contents Elements In Detail Base Salaries: The Compensation Committee generally reviews, and adjusts as necessary, base salaries for each of our NEOs annually. In connection with our year- end financial review process to determine 2018 base salaries, our CEO recommended, and our Compensation Committee approved the base salaries for our NEOs set forth below. The salaries paid to the NEOs who were with our company in fiscal 2018 were as follows: Named Executive Officer 2018 Salary ($) Charles L. Harrington 1,133,396 George L. Ball 554,521 Carey A. Smith 457,793 Michael W. Johnson(1) 445,774 Michael R. Kolloway 396,662 (1) Mr. Johnson resigned from his position as our Chief Development Officer in January 2019 and is no longer an executive officer of Parsons. However, we entered into a Consulting Services Agreement with Mr. Johnson, pursuant to which he agreed to provide transition assistance to us as an independent contractor until July 31, 2019, unless such agreement is earlier terminated by the parties. Mr. Johnson will be paid $40,000 per month for these services. Short Term Incentive Cash Bonuses . We provide our NEOs with the opportunity to earn annual cash bonuses to encourage the achievement of corporate and individual objectives and to reward those individuals who significantly impact our corporate results. The Compensation Committee determines and approves our annual bonus decisions. Fiscal 2018 Annual Bonuses . Under the fiscal 2018 management incentive plan, or MIP, the annual incentive target bonus of each executive officer was based on our performance against a mix of financial objectives (90%) and qualitative individual objectives (10%). The 2018 MIP also contained a modifier that could be used to adjust the bonus payout for the CEO by a factor of up to 20%, negatively or positively, of the funded amount based on certain goals aligned with the advancement of Company transformation and enhancement of the executive leadership team. The Compensation Committee then had sole discretion to determine any individual performance adjustments for each executive officer (including the CEO) and the final bonus payout for fiscal 2018. The annual incentive bonus is equal to the product of (i) a dollar amount representing the target amount that the executive officer may be paid as an annual incentive bonus payment, or the Target Incentive Bonus, multiplied by (ii) a percentage representing the overall achievement of the target levels and their weightings for each of the four performance measures for the fiscal year, or the Performance Goal Achievement. The Target Incentive Bonus, the performance measures and related target levels and weighting, and the method for determining the Performance Goal Achievement for each executive officer were determined by our Compensation Committee, as applicable, after taking into consideration the recommendations of our CEO (for NEOs other than the CEO) at the time the performance measures and related target levels and weightings were determined for the executive officer. No payout would be made for any financial objectives that failed to meet the performance threshold of 80%. Payouts were capped at 150% for the financial objectives, and 100% for the individual objectives. For purposes of the fiscal 2018 MIP, our Compensation Committee selected consolidated performance revenue, consolidated net operating income and consolidated cash flow as the three corporate performance measures that best supported our annual operating plan and enhanced long-term value creation. For Ms. Smith and Mr. Johnson, the net operating income and cash flow were business unit measures reflecting the focus and scope of responsibilities in their roles. 128 Table of Contents In addition, each executive officer had a qualitative metric. For those executive officers other than the CEO, the qualitative metric was measured on their achievement of individual performance goals. For the CEO, the qualitative metric was based on employee measurement of the performance of our core values. Weighting Plan Metrics Metric Type Corporate Executives Business Unit Executives Performance Revenue Corporate 30 % 30 % Net Operating Income Corporate 30 % Business Unit 30 % Cash Flow Corporate 30 % Business Unit 30 % Qualitative Individual Objectives 10 % 10 % For purposes of the fiscal 2018 MIP, performance revenue is revenue less revenue attributable to noncontrolling interests plus equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures. Net operating income is defined as revenue less revenue attributable to noncontrolling interests less direct costs of contracts (other than direct costs of contracts attributable to noncontrolling interests) less indirect, general and administrative expenses adjusted for non-operating items. Cash flow represents the net cash provided by, or used in, our operating, investing and financing activities, adjusted to exclude cash provided by, or used in, investing or financing activities that are non-recurring or outside our ordinary course of business. For fiscal 2018, the target levels for the three corporate financial performance measures were set as follows (in millions): Plan Metrics Metric Type Metric Target Actual Results Performance Revenue Corporate $ 3,196.7 $ 3,280.77 Net Operating Income Corporate $ 195.7 $ 194.72 Federal Solutions $ 106.9 $ 106.14 Critical Infrastructure(1) $ 109.1 $ 93.6 Cash Flow Corporate $ 112.0 $ 92.9 Federal Solutions $ 104.7 $ 121.69 Critical Infrastructure(1) $ 181.0 $ 159.8 (1) Mr Johnsons 2018 MIP Net Operating Income target was $86.5 million with an actual result of $69.2 million (rounded up to account for bonus payout calculation), resulting in 50% performance achievement, and a Cash Flow target of $116.7 million with an actual result of $153.59 million, resulting in 150% performance. Our Compensation Committee believed that achieving the target levels for the three corporate and one individual performance measures would require a focused and consistent effort by our executive officers throughout fiscal 2018. 129 Table of Contents The Performance Goal Achievement for the fiscal year was the sum of the performance achievement of each of the four performance goals described above for such fiscal year. The level of achievement of each of the three quantitative performance goals was determined as follows: If the actual quantitative goal performance for the fiscal year was Then the quantitative performance goal achievement for the fiscal year was Greater than 120% of the target performance goal measure 150% Greater than 100% but less than 120% of the corresponding target performance goal measure 100% - 150% Equal to the target performance goal measure 100% 80% or greater but less than 100% of the corresponding target performance goal measure 50% - 100%* Less than 80% of the target performance goal measure 0% * Between these values determined on a straight-line basis The following table provides information regarding the annual management incentive bonus awards earned by the NEOs for fiscal 2018: Name Target Bonus (%) Target Bonus ($) Financial Performance Achievement (weighted/ avg) Individual Objective Achievement Weighted Performance Achievement Modifier Bonus ($) Charles L. Harrington 125 % 1,425,000 78.81 % 100 % 88.81 % 15 % 1,455,500 George L. Ball 100 % 561,502 78.81 % 100 % 88.81 % 498,700 Carey A. Smith 110 % 509,858 103.61 % 100 % 113.61 % 579,300 Michael W.

Kolloway 75 % 301,161 78.81 % 100 % 88.81 % 267,500 (1) Mr. Johnson resigned from his position as our Chief Development Officer in January 2019 and is no longer an executive officer. In connection with his separation, we agreed to pay him a bonus of $498,000 under our MIP based on actual performance through the end of 2018. In addition, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to adjust an individual management incentive bonus payout based on its evaluation of an executive officers individual performance or other corporate financial objectives. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee adjusted Mr. Harringtons payout by applying a positive 15% modifier in connection with Mr. Harringtons performance in preparing our financial structure for the initial public offering, execution of strategic business acquisitions and enhancing the leadership team through key hires and developing bench strength. Long-Term Incentive Compensation : We use long-term incentive compensation in the form of phantom units that are generally settled in cash to motivate and reward our executive officers for long-term corporate performance based on a valuation of our common stock and, thereby, aligning the interests of our executive officers with those of our employee beneficial stockholders. For purposes of the fair market value of our common stock, prior to the consummation of this offering, we used the then most recently established value for our common stock established by the ESOP Trustee under the ESOP. Following the consummation of this offering, the fair market value of our common stock will be determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. We maintain the following long-term incentive compensation plans (collectively, the Incentive Plans) in which our NEOs participate, each of which are described in greater detail below:  Long Term Growth Plan, or LTGP;  Shareholder Value Plan, or SVP; and 130 Table of Contents  Restricted Award Plan, or RAU Each NEOs long-term incentive compensation target has historically been equally divided across these three plans and the awards under each plan have three year cliff vesting. Additionally, except in the case of death, disability or retirement, a participant must remain employed through the vesting date in order to receive payment on an award. The value of each of the awards under our Incentive Plans is linked to the value of our common stock, thereby supporting our pay-for performance philosophy and retention efforts. Our CEO advises the Compensation Committee with respect to who should participate in each plan, and provides information regarding each participants duties, present and potential contributions to the Company and such other factors as the board of directors may deem relevant for determining participation in the plans and the size of a participants award. In 2018, the targeted value of long-term incentive awards for our NEOs was: Named Executive Officer LTGP Target Award ($) LTGP Target Units (#) RAU Target Award ($) RAU Target Units (#) SVP Target Award ($) SVP Target Units (#) 2018 Long- Term Incentive Target Award ($) Charles L. Harrington 1,500,000 22,057 1,500,000 22,057 1,500,000 176,661 4,500,000 George L. Ball 290,000 4,264 290,000 4,264 290,000 34,154 870,000 Carey A. Smith 278,100 4,089 278,100 4,089 278,100 32,753 834,300 Michael W. Johnson(1) 270,000 3,970 270,000 3,970 270,000 31,799 810,000 Michael R. Kolloway 133,867 1,968 133,867 1,968 133,867 15,766 401,600 (1) Mr. Johnson resigned from his position as our Chief Development Officer in January 2019 and is no longer an executive officer. Upon his resignation he forfeited the awards granted in 2017 and 2018, but was allowed to retain his awards with a performance cycle of 2016 - 2018. The LTGP provides the opportunity for the NEOs to earn a cash payment based on a number of phantom stock units that are earned upon the achievement of pre-established performance objectives. Each phantom stock unit has the equivalent value of our common stock. Our LTGP, therefore is similar to a cash-settled performance vesting restricted stock unit. Each year our board of directors approves the applicable performance criteria, including the level(s) of performance, upon which the potential amount(s) payable will be determined in respect of a participants Long Term Growth Opportunity Target. A participants Long Term Growth Opportunity Target is the target dollar value of the incentive which could potentially be earned by an eligible participant in respect of a performance cycle. The target is expressed in U.S. dollars which are converted into phantom stock units based on our then-current share price at the beginning of the performance cycle. The performance goals may be expressed in terms of overall Company financial results on an absolute or relative basis, such as, but not limited to, its results in relation to a budgeted target or industry benchmarks. At the end of a performance cycle, the board of directors determines actual performance against the applicable performance goals and the resulting number of phantom stock units actually earned by a participant. The earned phantom stock units are then paid in cash based on the value of our common stock at the end of the performance cycle. The 2018-2020 performance cycle performance objectives were divided equally between cumulative contract award values and net operating income, which the Compensation Committee believed to be important metrics for driving performance and promoting alignment of the interests of our executive officers and our employee beneficial stockholders. The targets set for 2018-2020 performance goals were determined based on the business plan which is designed to be challenging yet attainable, with the opportunity for a maximum payout of 150% of the target units in connection with performance achievement of 120%, or greater, of the performance goal target. 131 Table of Contents Parsons must achieve threshold performance for at least one of these two financial metrics for any amount to be paid under the LTGP. For the 2016-2018 performance cycle, the performance objectives were gross profit sales, or GPS, and days sales outstanding, or DSO. Gross profit sales is defined as gross profit (calculated as revenue (excluding revenue attributable to noncontrolling interests) less direct costs of contracts (excluding direct costs of contracts attributable to noncontrolling interests)) earned on new contracts awarded during the performance cycle. Both metrics were weighted 50% and calculated independently. However, at least threshold performance must have been met for any amount to be paid under the LTGP. At threshold performance the participant earned 50% of his or her phantom unit award, 100% at target performance and 150% upon achievement of the maximum goal. The threshold, target and maximum goals for the 2016-2018 cycle were: Cumulative GPS Achievement ($ Billions) Payout Percentage <2.140 0 2.140 50 % 2.273 75 % 2.405 100 % 2.673 125 % =>2.940 150 % Results between threshold and target are determined by straight line interpolation, but a steeper curve was applied to performance between target and maximum. DSO Achievement (in days) Payout Percentage >88 0 88 50 % 84.5 75 % 81 100 % 77.5 125 % =<74 150 % For the 2016-2018 performance period, GPS was $2.488 billion and DSO was 94 days resulting in a weighted average performance achievement of 53.92% of the target award. The SVP provides a cash incentive based on the increase in our share price over a three (3) year period, multiplied by a number of phantom share units. If at the end of a performance cycle our share price has not increased, then no SVP incentive award payment will be earned. Our SVP acts similar to a time vested cash-settled stock appreciation right. We do not expect to make any awards under the SVP in 2019. The RAU provides the opportunity to earn a cash payment based on the value of a specified number of phantom stock units subject to the executive officers continued employment for a specified period. The RAU is similar to cash-settled time vested restricted stock units. As a public company we intend to continue making similar awards under our 2019 Plan which allows the Compensation Committee the discretion to settle awards in either cash or our shares. Awards granted under the Incentive Plans for 2019 may be settled in cash or shares in the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Other Compensation Elements. We also provide our employees, including our NEOs with a variety of employee benefit plans, including our ESOP, a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, 132 Table of Contents non-qualified deferred compensation plans and welfare benefits, such as health, life and disability, which we use to attract and retain our employees. We also offer an executive medical plan, financial planning, club membership and business travel perquisites, to the extent our board believes that these limited perquisites are appropriate to assist an individual NEO in the performance of his or her duties, to make our NEOs more efficient and effective, and for recruitment, motivation or retention purposes. Upon the annual competitive review of executive perquisites by the Compensation Committee in 2018, the Compensation Committee approved to terminate the executive medical plan and club benefits by the end of fiscal 2018. All future practices with respect to perquisites or other personal benefits will continue to be subject to periodic review and approval by the Compensation Committee. Post-Employment Compensation The initial terms and conditions of employment for each of our NEOs are set forth in written offer letters. Each of our NEOs are employed on an at-will basis. We have offered Mr. Harrington, Mr. Ball, and Mr. Kolloway certain protection in the event of their termination of employment under specified circumstances following a change in control of our company. We believe that these protections serve our executive retention objectives by ensuring that we will have continued dedication of the NEO and the availability of his or her advice and counsel, and, with respect to the post-change in control separation benefits, to induce the NEOs to remain in our employ in the face of a potential change in control. The terms of these arrangements were determined by the Compensation Committee. For a summary of the material terms and conditions of our post-employment compensation arrangements, see Potential Payments upon Change in Control below. Compensation Claw Back Policy Currently, we do not have a policy regarding retroactive adjustments to any cash compensation paid to our executive officers and other employees where the payments were predicated upon the achievement of financial results that were subsequently the subject of a financial restatement. We have adopted a general compensation recovery, or claw back, policy covering our annual and long-term incentive award plans and arrangements effective January 14, 2019. Compensation-Related Risk Our Compensation Committee is responsible for the oversight of our risk profile, including compensation-related risks. Our Compensation Committee monitors our compensation policies and practices as applied to our employees to ensure that these policies and practices do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk-taking, and that the level of risk that they do encourage is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. The compensation policies and practices in place that mitigate unnecessary risk include:  An appropriate compensation mix that is designed to balance the emphasis on short-term and long-term performance.  The majority of incentive compensation for top level executives is associated with our long-term performance. This discourages short-term risk taking.  Conservative vesting provisions (3 years) for all equity awards granted under our long-term incentive plans. 133 Table of Contents  Financial performance measures used for incentive plans covering colleagues at all levels of the Company include a mix of financial metrics that are in-line with operating and strategic plans.  A significant portion of annual and long-term incentive payments are based on Company and business profitability, ensuring a correlation between pay and performance.  Financial targets are appropriately set, and if not achieved, result in a large percentage loss of compensation.  Executive and broad-based incentive plans cap the maximum award payable to any individual. Annual and long-term incentive plans have a current maximum payout of 1.5 times the target amount. Impact of Tax and Accounting In designing and implementing our compensation programs the Compensation Committee takes into account the tax and accounting impact of such payments. However, it ultimately determines pay based on the most effective means to implement our long-term strategy.

Nonqualified Defined Contribution and Other Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Our NEOs may defer their annual cash incentive bonus under our Bonus Deferral Plan, and the value of the LTGP, SVP and RAU awards. The Bonus Deferral Plan: Our NEOs may participate in the Bonus Deferral Plan, which is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that allows them to meet their retirement and other future income needs by deferring all or a portion of their annual cash incentive bonus. The amount deferred earns interest each year at a rate equal to the average of the annual prime rates made available to preferred borrowers by the Los Angeles branch of the Bank of America. Benefits under this plan are payable upon termination of employment, a specified future date, or upon a change in control if so elected by the executive. While Mr. Harrington and Mr. Ball have participated in this plan in prior fiscal years, none of the NEOs made deferrals for 2018 in the Bonus Deferral Plan. LTGP, SVP and RAU: Participants in the LTGP, SVP and RAU can elect to defer 0% or 25% to 100% of the LTGP, SVP and RAU awards that may become payable under such the plans until the later of the participants termination of employment or at the date elected. Participants can elect that amounts that are to become payable upon such participants termination due to retirement or disability be paid in a lump sum payment, five substantially equal annual installments or ten substantially equal annual installments. While Mr. Ball has elected to defer a portion of his SVP awards in prior fiscal years, none of the NEOs elected to defer their LTGP, SVP or RAU awards in 2018. 137 Table of Contents Parsons Executive Restoration Plan (ERP): The ERP provides a vehicle to restore qualified plan benefits that are reduced because of limitations on compensation imposed under the Code under the ESOP and the 401(k) plan. The amount credited to a NEO under the ERP is equal to a percentage of the participants eligible compensation under the ESOP based on the total percentage of compensation that we contribute to the ESOP and the Companys match formula on deferrals under the 401(k) plan. These amounts are then converted into a value reflective of our common shares based on our then current share price. Participants vest in their ERP accounts in accordance with the same vesting schedule as the ESOP. Vested ERP account balances are paid in cash in a lump sum upon a participants termination of employment, or, if so elected by the participant, upon a change in control or substantial financial hardship. The value of the ERP account is determined based on our share price as determined by the committee that administers the ERP. Each of the NEOs participated in the ERP in 2018. We also have two historical deferred compensation plans pursuant to which executives were allowed to defer their long-term incentives, which we refer to as the Legacy Plans below. Deferrals under those plans also earn interest at the average of the annual prime rates made available to preferred borrowers by the Los Angeles branch of the Bank of America.

Potential Payments upon Change in Control Change in Control Agreements Mr. Harrington, Mr. Ball, Ms. Smith and Mr. Kolloway are eligible to receive certain severance payments and benefits in connection with various circumstances in connection with a change in control of the Company. The potential severance payments and benefits payable to these NEOs in the event of termination of employment as of December 31, 2018 pursuant to the terms of their individual change in control and severance agreements, or the CIC Agreements, as applicable, are described below. The CIC Agreements provide severance protections to Mr. Harrington, Mr. Ball, Ms. Smith and Mr. Kolloway in the event of a resignation by the executive for Good Reason or a termination by Parsons without Cause (as each such term is defined below) within eighteen months following a change in control or if any successor company fails to assume the CIC Agreement or repudiates or breaches any provision of the CIC Agreement within such eighteen month period (any such event, a Qualifying Event). 138 Table of Contents Under the CIC Agreements, if a Qualifying Event occurs, the executive is eligible to receive the following severance payments and benefits, subject to his or her written notice to the Company of such Qualifying Event, his or her execution of an effective release of claims in favor of the Company and continued compliance with his or her restrictive covenants, payable in a lump sum no later than two and a half months following the Qualifying Event, subject to any delays imposed by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code:  a pro rata portion (based on number of days that elapsed in the calendar year before the Qualifying Event occurred) of the greater of (i) the executives target annual bonus for the year of the Qualifying Event or (ii) the executives annual bonus that would have been paid (as determined by the board of directors in its discretion) assuming the year ended on the date of the Qualifying Event and based on actual performance through that date;  an amount equal to the highest rate of the executives annualized base salary in effect at any time up to and including the Qualifying Event multiplied by two (2), or for the CEO multiplied by three (3); and  an amount equal to the greater of (i) the executives target annual bonus for the year of the Qualifying Event or (ii) the average of the annual bonuses actually paid to the executive for the two (2) years preceding the year of the Qualifying Event, multiplied by two (2), or for the CEO multiplied by three (3); and  a non-discounted cash lump sum amount equal to the sum of the following: (i) the Companys estimate of the costs for the executives medical insurance coverage at the level and a cost to the executive comparable to that provided to the executive immediately prior to the Qualifying Event for a period of two (2) years following such Qualifying Event (which, in the companys discretion, may be based on the applicable COBRA rates); (ii) the Companys estimate of the costs for the continuation of that level of the executives life insurance coverage that is in effect immediately prior to the Qualifying Event, for a period of two (2) years following such Qualifying Event, or, if shorter, the period ending on the last day of the level premium rate guarantee period established by the applicable insurer for such coverage; and (iii) the Companys estimate of the cost for the continuation of the executives executive supplemental disability coverage under the Companys supplemental disability insurance plan in effect immediately prior to the Qualifying Event for a period of two (2) years following such Qualifying Event (or the date the executive attains age 65, if earlier), but the cash payment in this clause (iii) will only be paid if the terms of the applicable insurance policy under such disability insurance plan provide that the coverage may be continued following the Qualifying Event and such costs to be estimated using the extent of the coverage allowed under the terms such policy at a cost to the Company that is no greater than the cost borne by the Company immediately prior to the Qualifying Event. For purposes of the CIC Agreements, a change in control has the same definition as is given to such term in our 2019 Plan to be adopted in connection with this offering, as described below. For purposes of the CIC Agreements, (i) Cause means the executives (a) commission of fraud or embezzlement in connection with Parsons; (b) conviction of, or pleading guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude; or (c) willful and continued failure to substantially perform material duties which is not remedied in a reasonable period of time after written notice delivered by the board of directors; and (ii) Good Reason means the occurrence of any of the following events without the executives consent and which is not cured by Parsons within thirty days of such events occurrence: (a) a material reduction in the nature or status of the executives authorities, duties and/or responsibilities (viewed in the aggregate) from the level in effect on the day immediately prior to a change in control; (b) a reduction in the executives base salary as in effect on the day immediately prior to a change in control; (c) a material reduction of the executives aggregate welfare 139 Table of Contents benefits and/or the value of the incentive programs provided under Parsons management incentive and/or other short and/or long-term incentive programs, as such benefits and opportunities existed on the day immediately prior to a change in control; (d) relocation of the executives principal office by more than fifty miles from the location of the executives principal office as of the day immediately prior to a change in control; (e) any purported termination of the executive without satisfying the notice requirements in the CIC Agreement; and (f) Parsons failure to obtain agreement from any successor entity to assume and perform its obligations under the CIC Agreement. The CIC Agreements provide that in the event that any payments would subject the NEO to the excise taxes applicable under Section 4999 of the Code by reason of being a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code, then if it would cause a better net-after tax result, the amount of such payments will be reduced so that no excise tax would apply. Additionally, unless otherwise provided in an award agreement, upon a change in control, the value of (i) any outstanding RAU and SVP awards will vest in connection with the change in control, (ii) LTGP awards will vest at target and (iii) each participants deferral account, if any, will be paid to eligible participants (and beneficiaries) within 30 days following the change in control. Johnson Separation Agreement Michael Johnson, our Chief Development Officer, resigned from Parsons effective as of February 1, 2019. Pursuant to the terms of his Separation Agreement and Release of Claims and related Consulting Services Agreement, Mr. Johnson agreed to provide transition assistance support as an independent contractor until July 31, 2019, or until the agreement may be earlier terminated by the parties. We agreed to pay Mr. Johnson his bonus under our 2018 MIP as well as his long term incentive compensation due for the entire performance cycle for the LTGP, SVP and the RAU 2016-2018 performance cycle, in each case based on actual performance. Mr. Johnson remains subject to general non-disparagement and confidentiality covenants as well as six month post-termination non-competition and non-solicitation of customers covenants. In addition, Mr. Johnson remains subject to a twenty-four month (and in the case of employees in Missouri only, a twelve month) post-termination non-solicitation of employees covenant. In order to receive payments under his Separation Agreement, Mr. Johnson executed a general release of claims. Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control Table The following table sets forth the estimated payments that would be received by the NEOs in the event of a termination of employment without cause or following a resignation for good reason in connection with a change in control in our Company. The table below reflects amounts payable to the NEOs assuming their employment was terminated on December 31, 2018 and, if applicable, a change in control of our Company also occurred on that date.

Mr. Johnson will be paid $40,000 per month for these services. (5) On March 9, 2019, we entered into a Change in Control Severance Agreement with Ms. Smith, pursuant to which she would receive the same benefits as Mr. Ball and Mr. Kolloway described above under Change in Control Agreements. Director Compensation Our directors who are also our employees will not receive any additional compensation for their service on our board of directors, but we believe that attracting and retaining qualified non-employee directors is critical to our future growth and governance. In July 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed non-employee director pay practices of our peer group that Pearl Meyer and the Compensation Committee determined compete with us for talent and are in the same or related industries with similar revenue size. The Compensation Committee has determined to review non-employee director compensation biennially. From January 1 to September 30, 2018, independent directors received the following compensation:  an annual cash retainer of $80,000;  annual grants (similar to phantom equity) under the Share Value Retirement Plan, or SVRP, of $120,000;  additional annual cash retainers for each of the lead independent director ($25,000), committee chairs (Audit $20,000; Compensation $15,000; and Governance $10,000); and  special meeting fees ($2,000 in person and $1,000 telephonic, per meeting). Effective October 1, 2018, independent directors receive the following compensation:  an annual cash retainer of $100,000;  annual grants (similar to phantom equity) under the Share Value Retirement Plan of $160,000;  additional annual cash retainers for each of the lead independent directors ($35,000), committee chairs (Audit $20,000; Compensation $18,000; and Governance $15,000), and committee members (Audit $11,500; Compensation $8,000; and Governance $6,000);  additional annual cash retainers of $11,500 for each of the members of the executive committee to reflect the additional time required to address issues related to our initial public offering; and  special meeting fees ($2,000 in person and $1,000 telephonic, per meeting). 141 Table of Contents Following the completion of this offering, the annual grants previously under the Share Value Retirement Plan will instead be in the form of restricted stock units, or RSUs, under the 2019 Plan, as follows:  On the first day of each calendar quarter occurring prior to the first annual stockholders meeting but following the consummation of this offering, each non-employee director will be granted such number of restricted stock units as is equal to (1) $40,000 (or, if applicable, such prorated amount for the portion of the calendar quarter prior to the consummation of this offering not covered by previous awards under the SVRP) divided by (2) the 60 trading day weighted average of our common stock, up to and including grant date, rounded up to the nearest whole share. In the case where there is not yet 60 days of trading activity, value will be determined using available trading day weighted average of our common stock at the time of grant.  From and after the first annual stockholders meeting following the consummation of this offering, on the date of each annual stockholders meeting, each non-employee director will be granted such number of restricted stock units as is equal to (1) the $160,000 (plus, with respect to the first annual stockholders meeting following the consummation of this offering, a prorated quarterly target dollar amount for the portion of the calendar quarter in which such meeting occurs preceding the date of such meeting), divided by (2) the 60 trading day weighted average of our common stock, up to and including grant date, rounded up to the nearest whole share. The RSUs will vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The restricted stock units will also vest upon a change in control (as defined in the 2019 Plan), or a non-employee directors death or disability. The non-employee directors will also be eligible to make deferral elections with respect to such RSUs, with the deferral alternatives generally consistent with those under the SVRP and described below. The following table contains information concerning the compensation of our non-employee directors in fiscal 2018.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) Our employees participate in the ESOP, which is a defined contribution stock bonus retirement plan designed to enable eligible employees to obtain an ownership interest in Parsons. The ESOP is funded by contributions made by us which are held in a trust established as part of the ESOP. The contributions are invested in our common stock. Contributions and any earnings or dividends thereon, to the extent such amounts remain in the ESOP, accumulate on a tax deferred basis. 142 Table of Contents We may make discretionary contributions to the ESOP each year in an amount to be determined by our board of directors and may be made in cash or in shares of our common stock. The annual contributions to the ESOP are allocated to participants accounts each year, as of the last day of the year, to participants who were eligible employees during the year, and the allocations are made on a basis proportional to compensation. Covered compensation for an eligible employee under the ESOP generally includes base pay, overtime pay, assignment premiums included in base pay and most pre-tax deductions. Bonuses, relocation expenses and most other reimbursements are generally excluded from covered compensation. The value of vested account balances, subject to eligibility, vesting and distribution rules, are distributed to participants, generally only after their retirement from Parsons after attaining age 65 (or 62 with 6 or more years of service). Distributions will generally be in a series of installment payments over a number of years. Based on ESOP participants account balances and installment options, we expect distributions in the aggregate will generally be made ratably over three years. The number of installments are based on participant account balances at the time of distribution. Participants with accounts valued over $40,000 may elect three or five year installments, accounts between $40,000 and $20,001 are paid in two annual installments, and accounts less than $20,001 are paid in a lump sum. Distributions prior to termination of employment or reaching retirement age (65 or 62 with 6 or more years of service) are generally not permitted, unless the participant dies. Participants who die prior to beginning their installments, and participants who receive conflict of interest distributions following termination of employment, are also paid in a lump sum. The IPO Dividend will be allocated to participant accounts on or before December 31, 2019, with such allocations based proportionately on participant account balances on April 3, 2019, which was the record date for the IPO Dividend. The IPO Dividend, to the extent not applied to cover distributions during the 180-day lock-up period, will be reinvested in our common stock on or before December 31, 2019. The number of shares of our common stock to be allocated and paid will be equal to the sum of (1) any shares purchased by the ESOP from participants who received distributions during the 180-day lock-up period, and (2) any shares purchased by the ESOP following the expiration of the 180-day lock-up period with any of the cash proceeds from the IPO Dividend that were not used to satisfy participant distributions during such period (which purchases will be undertaken by the ESOP Trustee as soon as practicable following the expiration of the 180-day lock-up period). With respect to cash dividends other than the IPO Dividend, if the board of directors declares and pays a cash dividend on shares of our common stock held in the ESOP and allocated to participant accounts, then this dividend may either be paid currently and directly to the participant or held in the ESOP as determined by the committee that administers the ESOP, or the Policy Committee, in its discretion. Any such cash dividends will be paid in cash. Dividends on shares of unallocated stock will not be distributed to the participant currently but will either be applied to pay off any ESOP loans or held in the ESOP. The ESOP currently does not have any ESOP loans. Participants who have attained age 55 and who have completed at least 10 years of participation in the ESOP are permitted to diversify a portion of their respective ESOP accounts over a period of six years. For the first five plan years that a participant is allowed to diversify his or her accounts, the participant is permitted to diversify up to 25% of the value (as of the last day of the preceding plan year) of their vested diversification eligible ESOP account. For the sixth plan year the participant is permitted to diversify up to 50% of the value (as of the last day of the preceding plan year) of their vested ESOP diversification eligible account. This diversification election applies only to shares acquired by the ESOP after 1987, or the Diversification Eligible Shares. Shares acquired by the ESOP prior to 1987 are not eligible for this diversification election. In total, as of December 31, 2018, the ESOP held 5,768,117 Diversification Eligible Shares. However, only 323,930 shares are eligible for diversification in 2019. If a participant elects to diversify his or her accounts, historically, we have repurchased such shares for cash. 143 Table of Contents During the 180-day lock-up period following the date of this prospectus, ESOP distributions will be made in the form of cash. Beginning on the 181 st day following the date of this prospectus, ESOP distributions will be made in the form of shares of our common stock (other than distributions in respect of fractional shares, which will be made in cash) and will be available for sale into the public market, subject to compliance with applicable federal securities laws. Proceeds from the IPO Dividend will be used to satisfy any qualifying distributions during the 180-day lock-up period. However, if the IPO Dividend is not sufficient to satisfy all qualifying distribution elections owed to participants during the 180-day lock-up period, the ESOP Trustee will have the right to cause us to purchase shares held by the ESOP in order to allow the ESOP to pay participants in cash. Incentive Award Plan In connection with this offering, our board of directors adopted our Incentive Award Plan, or the 2019 Plan, pursuant to which we may grant cash and equity incentive awards to eligible service providers in order to attract, motivate and retain the talent for which we compete. The 2019 Plan became effective on the date of this prospectus. The material terms of the 2019 Plan are summarized below. Eligibility and administration. Our employees and the employees of our subsidiaries and individual consultants, as well as our directors are eligible to receive awards under the 2019 Plan. Following our initial public offering, the 2019 Plan will be administered by our board of directors with respect to awards to non-employee directors and by our compensation committee with respect to other participants, each of which may delegate its duties and responsibilities to committees of our directors and/or officers (referred to collectively as the plan administrator below), subject to certain limitations that may be imposed under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, or the rules and standards of any stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. The plan administrator has the authority to make all determinations and interpretations under, prescribe all forms for use with, and adopt rules for the administration of, the 2019 Plan, subject to its express terms and conditions. The plan administrator sets the terms and conditions of all awards under the 2019 Plan, including any vesting and vesting acceleration conditions. Limitation on awards and shares available. The number of shares of our common stock initially reserved available for issuance under awards granted pursuant to the 2019 Plan is equal to (1) 3,900,000 shares, less (2) any shares issued pursuant to awards granted during 2019 under the LTGP or the RAU (which number of shares pursuant to this clause (2) will not exceed 347,223 shares). Shares distributed pursuant to an award granted under the 2019 Plan may be authorized but unissued shares, or shares purchased in the open market. If an award under the 2019 Plan is forfeited, expires, is settled for cash (including shares repurchased by us for the same price paid by the holder), or is converted to shares of another person in connection with certain transactions, any shares subject to such award may, to the extent of such forfeiture, expiration or cash settlement, be used again for new grants under the 2019 Plan. However, the following shares may not be used again for grant under the 2019 Plan: (1) shares tendered or withheld to satisfy grant or exercise price or tax withholding obligations associated with an award; (2) shares subject to a stock appreciation right, or SAR, that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the SAR on its exercise; and (3) shares purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of options. Shares that are repurchased by us at the same price paid by the holder of such shares will again be available for grant of awards under the 2019 Plan. The payment of dividend equivalents in cash in conjunction with any outstanding awards will not be counted against the shares available for issuance under the 2019 Plan. Awards granted under the 2019 Plan upon the assumption of, or in substitution for, awards authorized or outstanding under a qualifying equity plan 144 Table of Contents maintained by an entity with which we enter into a merger or similar corporate transaction will not reduce the shares available for grant under the 2019 Plan. Awards. The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, including incentive stock options, or ISOs, and non-qualified stock options, or NSOs, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, restricted stock units, or RSUs, other stock or cash based awards and stock appreciation rights. Certain awards under the 2019 Plan may constitute or provide for a deferral of compensation, subject to Section 409A of the Code, which may impose additional requirements on the terms and conditions of such awards. All awards under the 2019 Plan will be set forth in award agreements, which will detail the terms and conditions of the awards, including any applicable vesting and payment terms and post-termination exercise limitations. Awards other than cash awards generally will be settled in shares of our common stock, but the plan administrator may provide for cash settlement of any award. A brief description of each award type follows.  Stock options . Stock options provide for the purchase of shares of our common stock in the future at an exercise price set on the grant date. ISOs, by contrast to NSOs, may provide tax deferral beyond exercise and favorable capital gains tax treatment to their holders if certain holding period and other requirements of the Code are satisfied. The exercise price of a stock option may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the underlying share on the date of grant, or 110% in the case of ISOs granted to certain significant stockholders, except with respect to certain substitute options granted in connection with a corporate transaction. The term of a stock option may not be longer than ten years, or five years in the case of ISOs granted to certain significant stockholders. Vesting conditions determined by the plan administrator may apply to stock options and may include continued service, performance and/or other conditions. ISOs may be granted only if the 2019 Plan is approved by stockholders within 12 months of the date of the boards initial adoption of the 2019 Plan.  SARs. Stock appreciation rights, or SARs, entitle their holder, upon exercise, to receive from us an amount equal to the appreciation of the shares subject to the award between the grant date and the exercise date. The exercise price of a SAR may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the underlying share on the date of grant, except with respect to certain substitute SARs granted in connection with a corporate transaction, and the term of a SAR may not be longer than ten years. Vesting conditions determined by the plan administrator may apply to SARs and may include continued service, performance and/or other conditions.  Restricted stock and RSUs . Restricted stock is an award of nontransferable shares of our common stock that remain forfeitable unless and until specified conditions are met, and which may be subject to a purchase price. RSUs are contractual promises to deliver shares of our common stock or cash in the future, which may also remain forfeitable unless and until specified conditions are met. Delivery of the shares underlying RSUs may be deferred under the terms of the award or at the election of the participant, if the plan administrator permits such a deferral. Conditions applicable to restricted stock and RSUs may be based on continuing service, the attainment of performance goals and/or such other conditions as the plan administrator may determine.  Other stock or cash based awards . Other stock or cash based awards are awards of cash, fully vested shares of our common stock and other awards valued wholly or partially by referring to, or otherwise based on, shares of our common stock. Other stock or cash based awards may be available as a payment form in the settlement of other awards, as standalone payments and as payment in lieu of base salary, bonus, fees or other cash compensation otherwise payable to any individual who is eligible to receive awards.  Dividend equivalents . Dividend equivalents represent the right to receive the equivalent value of dividends paid on shares of our common stock and may be granted alone or in tandem with 145 Table of Contents awards. Dividend equivalents are generally credited as of dividend record dates during the period between the date an award is granted and the date such award vests, is exercised, is distributed or expires, as determined by the plan administrator. Dividend equivalents with respect to any performance vesting award shall only be paid out to the extent that the performance vesting conditions with respect to such award are subsequently satisfied. Dividend equivalents will not be payable with respect to options or SARs. Director Award Limits. The 2019 Plan provides that a director can receive no more than $900,000, in the aggregate, in awards with a grant date fair value or cash value in any one year. Certain transactions. The plan administrator has broad discretion to take action under the 2019 Plan, as well as make adjustments to the terms and conditions of existing and future awards, to prevent the dilution or enlargement of intended benefits and facilitate necessary or desirable changes in the event of certain transactions and events affecting our common stock, such as stock dividends, stock splits, mergers, acquisitions, consolidations and other corporate transactions. In addition, in the event of certain non-reciprocal transactions with our stockholders known as equity restructurings, the plan administrator will make equitable adjustments to the 2019 Plan and outstanding awards. If an award continues in effect or is assumed or substituted in connection with a change in control of our Company (as defined in the 2019 Plan), and the surviving or successor entity terminates a holders employment or service for cause (as defined by the administrator or as set forth in an applicable award agreement) within twelve months of such change in control (or as otherwise set forth in the applicable award agreement), the such holders award(s) will become fully vested. In the event of a change in control of our Company, to the extent that the surviving or successor entity declines to continue, convert, assume or replace outstanding awards, then prior to the change in control the plan administrator may cause (i) any or all awards (or portion thereof) to terminate in exchange for cash, rights or other property or (ii) any or all awards (or portion thereof) to become fully vested and exercisable prior to the consummation of such change in control and all forfeiture restrictions will lapse. For purposes of the 2019 Plan, a change in control means each of the following:  A transaction or series of transactions (other than an offering of our common stock to the general public through a registration statement filed with the SEC) whereby any person or related group of persons (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) directly or indirectly acquires beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) of securities of the Company possessing more than 50 % of the total combined voting power of the Companys securities outstanding immediately after such acquisition; provided, however, that the following acquisitions shall not constitute a change in control: (i) any acquisition by the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (ii) any acquisition by an employee benefit plan maintained by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) any acquisition which complies with the third bullet below; or (iv) in respect of an award held by a particular holder, any acquisition by the holder or any group of persons including the holder (or any entity controlled by the holder or any group of persons including the holder); or  The incumbent directors cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the Board;  The consummation by the Company (whether directly involving the Company or indirectly involving the Company through one or more intermediaries) of (x) a merger, consolidation, reorganization, or business combination, (y) a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Companys assets in any single transaction or series of related transactions or (z) the acquisition of assets or stock of another entity, in each case other than a transaction:  which results in the Companys voting securities outstanding immediately before the transaction continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted 146 Table of Contents into voting securities of the Company or the person that, as a result of the transaction, controls, directly or indirectly, the Company or owns, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the Companys assets or otherwise succeeds to the business of the Company (the Company or such person, the Successor Entity)) directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the combined voting power of the Successor Entitys outstanding voting securities immediately after the transaction, and  after which no person or group beneficially owns voting securities representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Successor Entity; provided, however, that no person or group shall be treated as beneficially owning 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Successor Entity solely as a result of the voting power held in the Company prior to the consummation of the transaction; and  after which at least a majority of the members of the board of directors (or the analogous governing body) of the Successor Entity were members of our board of directors at the time of the board of directors approval of the execution of the initial agreement providing for such transaction; or  the date which is 10 business days prior to the completion of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company. For sake of clarity, a change in control will not occur by reason of the ESOP owning less than 50% of the voting power of the Companys (or any successor thereto) equity securities due to the ESOP making distributions to participants and their beneficiaries, or the ESOP selling equity securities to the public through underwritten registered public offerings. Foreign participants, claw-back provisions, transferability, and participant payments. The plan administrator may modify award terms or establish subplans or procedures, subject to the share limits described above, in order to facilitate grants of awards subject to the laws and/or stock exchange rules of countries outside of the United States. All awards will be subject to the provisions of any claw-back policy implemented by us as set forth in such claw-back policy or in the applicable award agreement. With limited exceptions for estate planning, domestic relations orders, certain beneficiary designations and the laws of descent and distribution, awards under the 2019 Plan are generally non-transferable prior to vesting, and are exercisable only by the participant. With regard to tax withholding, exercise price and purchase price obligations arising in connection with awards under the 2019 Plan, the plan administrator may, in its discretion, accept cash or check, shares of our common stock that meet specified conditions, the surrender of shares of our common stock then issuable upon the stock options exercise valued at their fair market value on the exercise date, the delivery of a market sell order or such other consideration as it deems suitable. Plan amendment and termination. Our board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate the 2019 Plan at any time; however, except in connection with certain changes in our capital structure, stockholder approval will be required for any amendment that increases the number of shares available. No award may be granted pursuant to the 2019 Plan after the tenth anniversary of the date on which our board of directors adopted the 2019 Plan. Solely for purposes of permitting the Company to grant ISOs under the 2019 Plan, we may submit the 2019 Plan for the approval of the Companys stockholders within 12 months after the date of the board of directors initial adoption of the 2019 Plan. ISOs may be granted or awarded prior to such stockholder approval, but no shares of our common stock will be issued upon the exercise, vesting, distribution or payment of any such ISOs prior to the time when the 2019 Plan is approved by the Companys stockholders. If such approval has not been obtained at the end of said 12-month period, the 2019 Plan will continue in effect, but all ISOs previously granted or awarded under the 2019 Plan will cease to be treated as ISOs and will automatically be treated for all purposes NQSOs, and no ISOs may thereafter be granted under the 2019 Plan. 147 Table of Contents CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The following is a description of transactions since January 1, 2016, to which we have been a party, in which the amount involved exceeds or will exceed $120,000 and in which any of our directors, executive officers or holders of more than 5% of our capital stock, or an affiliate or immediate family member thereof, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. ESOP Contributions of treasury stock to the ESOP are made annually in amounts determined by our board of directors and are held in trust for the sole benefit of the ESOP participants. Contributions of 656,027 shares, 596,832 shares and 624,996 shares of our common stock were made to the ESOP in fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. In fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, we repurchased 2,480,021 shares, 1,827,737 shares and 1,851,297 shares of our common stock from the ESOP, respectively, in connection with the redemption of ESOP participants interests in the ESOP for $148.7 million, $111.4 million and $125.8 million, respectively. Unconsolidated Joint Ventures We often provide services to our unconsolidated joint ventures and our revenues include amounts related to recovering overhead costs for these services. Our revenues included $127.7 million in fiscal 2016, $112.1 million in fiscal 2017 and $144.7 million in fiscal 2018 related to services we provided to our unconsolidated joint ventures. For the years ended December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, we incurred approximately $96.2 million, $81.8 million and $111.1 million, respectively, of reimbursable costs. Indemnification Agreements and Directors and Officers Liability Insurance We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. These agreements, among other things, require us to indemnify each director and executive officer to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, including indemnification of expenses such as attorneys fees, judgments, penalties fines and settlement amounts incurred by the director or executive officer in any action or proceeding, including any action or proceeding by or in right of us, arising out of the persons services as a director or executive officer. We also maintain directors and officers liability insurance. Policies and Procedures for Related Party Transactions Our written related person transaction policy, to be effective upon the consummation of this offering, sets forth the policies and procedures for the review and approval or ratification of related person transactions. This policy will cover, with certain exceptions set forth in Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, any transaction, arrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships in which we were or are to be a participant, where the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, including, without limitation, purchases of goods or services by or from the related person or entities in which the related person has a material interest, indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness and employment by us of a related person. In reviewing and approving any such transactions, our audit committee is tasked to consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to, whether the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in an arms length transaction with an unrelated third party and the extent of the related persons interest in the transaction. All of the transactions described in this section occurred prior to the adoption of this policy. 148 Table of Contents PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS The following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of December 31, 2018, and as adjusted to reflect the sale of our common stock offered by us in this offering, for:  each of our NEOs;  each of our directors;  all of our current directors and executive officers as a group; and  each person, or group of affiliated persons, known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares common stock. We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC, which generally means that a person has beneficial ownership of a security if he or she possesses sole or shared voting or investment power of that security. The information in the table below does not necessarily indicate beneficial ownership for any other purpose, including for purposes of Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Securities Act. We have based our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership prior to this offering on 26,057,603 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018. We have based our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership after this offering on shares of common stock outstanding immediately after the completion of this offering. Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each beneficial owner listed in the table below is c/o Parsons Corporation, 5875 Trinity Parkway #300, Centreville, Virginia 20120.

Such person shares voting and investment power with the ESOP with respect to such shares beneficially owned through the ESOP. (2) Consists of shares of common stock beneficially owned by our executive officers and directors through the ESOP, rounded to the nearest whole share. (3) Includes 26,057,603 allocated shares (i.e., shares of our common stock that are held in the ESOP and allocated to an ESOP participants account), and 0 unallocated shares (i.e., shares of our common stock held in the ESOP but not allocated to any ESOP participants account). The ESOP Trustee votes allocated shares as directed by such ESOP participant or beneficiary of the ESOP. Under the terms of the ESOP, the ESOP Trustee will vote all of the unallocated shares and all of the allocated shares for which no voting directions are timely received by the ESOP Trustee. In addition, the ESOP Trustee has fiduciary duties under ERISA to the ESOP and its participants which may cause the ESOP Trustee to override participants voting directions. The ESOP shares voting and investment power with the ESOP participants with respect to the allocated shares. 150 Table of Contents DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK General As of the closing of this offering, our authorized capital stock will consist of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share. The following description of our capital stock and provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws are summaries and are qualified by reference to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws that will become effective upon the closing of this offering. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws will be approved by our pre-IPO stockholders prior to this offering. Copies of these documents will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as exhibits to our registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part. The description of our capital stock reflects changes to our capital structure that will occur upon the closing of this offering. Common Stock Upon completion of this offering, there will be shares of our common stock outstanding. Voting Rights Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share of common stock. Holders of shares of common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of stockholders. All matters, except the election of directors or as otherwise provided, will be decided by the vote of a majority in interest of the stockholders present and entitled to vote. The persons receiving the greatest number of votes shall be the persons elected as directors. We have not provided for cumulative voting for the election of directors in our certificate of incorporation. Economic Rights Dividends . Subject to preferences that may apply to shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available if our board of directors, in its discretion, determines to issue dividends and only then at the times and in the amounts that our board of directors may determine. See Dividend Policy for more information. Any dividend or distributions paid or payable to the holders of shares of common stock shall be paid pro rata, on an equal priority, pari passu basis. Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions . Upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders shall be distributable ratably among the holders of our common stock, subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the preferential rights and payment of liquidation preferences, if any, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock. Choice of Forum Our certificate of incorporation will provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty by any of our directors, officers, employees or stockholders owed to us or our 151 Table of Contents stockholders; (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this choice of forum provision. It is possible that a court of law could rule that the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation is inapplicable or unenforceable if it is challenged in a proceeding or otherwise. This choice of forum provision has important consequences for our stockholders. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Common Stock and This OfferingOur certificate of incorporation will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. These provisions do not apply to violations of the federal securities laws of the United States. Preferred Stock Under the terms of our certificate of incorporation that will become effective upon the closing of this offering, our board of directors is authorized to direct us to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval. Our board of directors has the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, of each series of preferred stock. The purpose of authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock and determine its rights and preferences is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific issuances. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our common stock and the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, future financings and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Upon the closing of this offering, there will be no shares of preferred stock outstanding, and we have no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock. Anti-takeover Provisions Classified Board of Directors and Removal of Directors Our certificate of incorporation will provide that our board of directors will be divided into three classes, with the classes as nearly equal in number as possible and each class serving three-year staggered terms. The classification of directors will have the effect of making it more difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board. Our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws will provide that a director may be removed only for cause. Any vacancy on our board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may be filled only by vote of a majority of our directors then in office. Stockholder Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders Our certificate of incorporation provides that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may 152 Table of Contents not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws also provide that, except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of our stockholders can only be called by our board of directors or a board committee authorized with the power to call such meetings. Authorized But Unissued Shares The authorized but unissued shares of our common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the listing standards of the NYSE. These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate finance transactions, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could make more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. The foregoing provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control. These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and in the policies formulated by our board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change of control. These provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and, as a consequence, they also may inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. Such provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management or delaying or preventing a transaction that might benefit you or other minority stockholders. In addition, upon the closing of this offering, we will be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Subject to certain exceptions, Section 203 prevents a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that the person became an interested stockholder, unless the interested stockholder attained such status with the approval of our board of directors or unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A business combination includes, among other things, a merger or consolidation involving us and the interested stockholder and the sale of more than 10% of our assets. In general, an interested stockholder is any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person. Transfer Agent and Registrar Upon completion of this offering, the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock will be . The address of the transfer agent and registrar is . Limitations of Liability and Indemnification See the section captioned Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions Indemnification Agreements and Directors and Officers Liability Insurance. Listing We have applied to list our common stock on the NYSE under the symbol PSN. 153 Table of Contents SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE Immediately prior to this offering, there was no public market for our common stock, and we cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time. Future sales of our common stock in the public market, or the availability of such shares for sale in the public market, could adversely affect market prices prevailing from time to time. As described below, only a limited number of shares of our common stock will be available for sale shortly after this offering due to contractual and legal restrictions on resale. Nevertheless, sales of our common stock in the public market after such restrictions lapse, or the perception that those sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price at such time and our ability to raise equity capital in the future. Following the completion of this offering, shares of our common stock will be outstanding, assuming no exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares. Of these outstanding shares, all of the shares of our common stock sold in this offering will be freely tradable, except that any shares purchased in this offering by our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, would only be able to be sold in compliance with the Rule 144 limitations described below. The remaining outstanding shares of our common stock not sold in this offering will be deemed restricted securities as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144 or Rule 701 under the Securities Act, which rules are summarized below. All of our executive officers, directors and the ESOP, which holds all of our capital stock prior to this offering, have entered into lock-up agreements with the underwriters under which they have agreed, subject to specific exceptions, not to sell any of our stock for 180 days following the date of this prospectus. As a result of these agreements and subject to the provisions of Rule 144 or Rule 701, shares of our common stock will be available for sale in the public market as follows:  beginning on the date of this prospectus, all shares of our common stock sold in this offering will be immediately available for sale in the public market; and  beginning 181 days after the date of this prospectus, the remaining shares of our common stock will be eligible for sale in the public market from time to time thereafter, subject in some cases to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144, as described below. Lock-Up Agreements We, our officers, directors and the ESOP, which holds all of our capital stock prior to this offering, have agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus, we and they will not, without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, dispose of or hedge any shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our capital stock. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated may, in their discretion, release any of the securities subject to lock-up agreements at any time. When determining whether or not to release our common stock and other securities from lock-up agreements, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated will consider, among other factors, the holders reasons for requesting the release, the number of shares for which the release is being requested and market conditions at the time of the request. In the event of such a release or waiver for one of our directors or officers, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated shall provide us with notice of the impending release or waiver at least three business days before the effective date of such release or waiver and we will announce the impending release or waiver by issuing a press release at least two business days before the effective date of the release or waiver. 154 Table of Contents Rule 144 In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, once we have been subject to the public company reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act for at least 90 days, a person who is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates for purposes of the Securities Act at any time during the 90 days preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned the shares of our common stock proposed to be sold for at least six months is entitled to sell those shares without complying with the manner of sale, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144, subject to compliance with the public information requirements of Rule 144. If such a person has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least one year, including the holding period of any prior owner other than our affiliates, then that person would be entitled to sell those shares without complying with any of the requirements of Rule 144. In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, our affiliates or persons selling shares of our common stock on behalf of our affiliates are entitled to sell upon expiration of the market standoff agreements and lock-up agreements described above, within any three-month period, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of:  1% of the number of shares of our capital stock then outstanding, which will equal shares immediately after this offering; or  the average weekly trading volume of our common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to that sale. Sales under Rule 144 by our affiliates or persons selling shares of our common stock on behalf of our affiliates are also subject to manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us. S-8 Registration Statement We intend to file a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act promptly after the completion of this offering to register shares of our common stock currently outstanding, as well as reserved for future issuance, under our equity compensation plans, including shares held by the ESOP. The registration statement on Form S-8 is expected to become effective immediately upon filing, and shares of our common stock covered by the registration statement will then become eligible for sale in the public market, subject to the Rule 144 limitations applicable to affiliates, vesting restrictions and any applicable market standoff agreements and lock-up agreements. See the section captioned Executive CompensationIncentive Award Plan for a description of our equity compensation plans. 155 Table of Contents MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below) of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock issued pursuant to this offering, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. The effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the IRS, in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a Non-U.S. Holder of our common stock. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock. This discussion is limited to Non-U.S. Holders that hold our common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a Non-U.S. Holders particular circumstances, including the impact of the alternative minimum tax or the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to Non-U.S. Holders subject to special rules, including, without limitation:  U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;  persons holding our common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment;  banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;  brokers, dealers or traders in securities, currencies or commodities;  controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;  partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein);  tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations;  persons deemed to sell our common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code;  persons who hold or receive our common stock pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option or otherwise as compensation;  tax-qualified retirement plans;  qualified foreign pension funds as defined in Section 897(l)(2) of the Code and entities all of the interests of which are held by qualified foreign pension funds; and  persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the stock being taken into account in an applicable financial statement (as defined in the Code). If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding our common stock and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them. 156 Table of Contents THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR COMMON STOCK ARISING UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX LAWS OR UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY. Definition of a Non-U.S. Holder For purposes of this discussion, a Non-U.S. Holder is any beneficial owner of our common stock that is neither a U.S. person nor an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. person is any person that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is or is treated as any of the following:  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;  a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;  an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or  a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more United States persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Distributions As described in the section entitled Dividend Policy, other than the IPO Dividend, we do not anticipate declaring or paying dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. However, if we do make distributions of cash or property on our common stock, such distributions will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Amounts not treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes will constitute a return of capital and first be applied against and reduce a Non-U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in its common stock, but not below zero. Any excess will be treated as capital gain and will be treated as described below under Sale or Other Taxable Disposition. Subject to the discussion below on effectively connected income, backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below), dividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder of our common stock will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the dividends (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty, provided the Non-U.S. Holder furnishes a valid IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable documentation) certifying qualification for the lower treaty rate). A Non-U.S. Holder that does not timely furnish the required documentation, but that qualifies for a reduced treaty rate, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under any applicable income tax treaty. If dividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holders conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder maintains a permanent establishment in the United States to which such dividends are attributable), the Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from the U.S. federal withholding tax described above. To claim the exemption, the Non-U.S. Holder must furnish to the applicable 157 Table of Contents withholding agent a valid IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the dividends are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holders conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Any such effectively connected dividends will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated rates. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected dividends, as adjusted for certain items. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable tax treaties that may provide for different rules. Sale or Other Taxable Disposition Subject to the discussion below on backup withholding and FATCA, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other taxable disposition of our common stock unless:  the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holders conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder maintains a permanent establishment in the United States to which such gain is attributable);  the Non-U.S. Holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition and certain other requirements are met; or  subject to certain exceptions, our common stock constitutes a U.S. real property interest, or USRPI, by reason of our status as a U.S. real property holding corporation, or USRPHC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated rates. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain, as adjusted for certain items. Gain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses. With respect to the third bullet point above, we believe we currently are not, and do not anticipate becoming, a USRPHC. Because the determination of whether we are a USRPHC depends, however, on the fair market value of our USRPIs relative to the fair market value of our non-U.S. real property interests and our other business assets, there can be no assurance we currently are not a USRPHC or will not become one in the future. Even if we are or were to become a USRPHC, gain arising from the sale or other taxable disposition by a Non-U.S. Holder of our common stock will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if our common stock is regularly traded, as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market, and such Non-U.S. Holder owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of our common stock throughout the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or other taxable disposition or the Non-U.S. Holders holding period. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Payments of dividends on our common stock will not be subject to backup withholding, provided the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know the holder is a 158 Table of Contents United States person and the holder either certifies its non-U.S. status, such as by furnishing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI, or otherwise establishes an exemption. However, information returns are required to be filed with the IRS in connection with any dividends on our common stock paid to the Non-U.S. Holder, regardless of whether any tax was actually withheld. In addition, proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition of our common stock within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related brokers generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting, if the applicable withholding agent receives the certification described above and does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a United States person, or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Proceeds of a disposition of our common stock conducted through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may also be made available under the provisions of an applicable treaty or agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a Non-U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Additional Withholding Tax on Payments Made to Foreign Accounts Withholding taxes may be imposed under Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA) on certain types of payments made to non-U.S. financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on dividends on, or (subject to the proposed Treasury Regulations discussed below) gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, our common stock paid to a foreign financial institution or a non-financial foreign entity (each as defined in the Code), unless (1) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations, (2) the non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any substantial United States owners (as defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United States owner, or (3) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements in (1) above, it must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury requiring, among other things, that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain specified United States persons or United States owned foreign entities (each as defined in the Code), annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on certain payments to non-compliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. Under the applicable Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally applies to payments of interest on a note. While withholding under FATCA would have applied also to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of a note on or after January 1, 2019, recently proposed Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations until final Treasury Regulations are issued. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of withholding under FATCA to their investment in our common stock. 159 Table of Contents UNDERWRITING The Company and the underwriters named below have entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to the shares being offered. Subject to certain conditions, each underwriter has severally agreed to purchase the number of shares indicated in the following table. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC are the representatives of the underwriters. Underwriters Number of Shares Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC. Jefferies LLC Wells Fargo Securities, LLC Cowen and Company, LLC SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. MUFG Securities Americas Inc. Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. Total The underwriters are committed to take and pay for all of the shares being offered, if any are taken, other than the shares covered by the option described below unless and until this option is exercised. The underwriters have an option to buy up to an additional shares from the Company to cover sales by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than the total number set forth in the table above. They may exercise that option for 30 days. If any shares are purchased pursuant to this option, the underwriters will severally purchase shares in approximately the same proportion as set forth in the table above. The following table shows the per share and total underwriting discounts and commissions to be paid to the underwriters by the Company. Such amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares. Paid by the Company No Exercise Full Exercise Per Share $ $ Total $ $ Shares sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the initial public offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectus. Any shares sold by the underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount of up to $ per share from the initial public offering price. After the initial offering of the shares, the representatives may change the offering price and the other selling terms. The offering of the shares by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters right to reject any order in whole or in part. The Company and its officers, directors and the ESOP, which holds all of our capital stock prior to this offering, have agreed with the underwriters, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common 160 Table of Contents stock during the period from the date of this prospectus continuing through the date 180 days after the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of the representatives. See Shares Available for Future Sale for a discussion of certain transfer restrictions. Prior to the offering, there has been no public market for the shares. The initial public offering price has been negotiated among the Company and the representatives. Among the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price of the shares, in addition to prevailing market conditions, will be the companys historical performance, estimates of the business potential and earnings prospects of the Company, an assessment of the Companys management and the consideration of the above factors in relation to market valuation of companies in related businesses. An application has been made to list the common stock on the NYSE under the symbol PSN. In order to meet one of the requirements for listing the common stock on the NYSE, the underwriters have undertaken to sell lots of 100 or more shares to a minimum of 400 beneficial holders. In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares of common stock in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering, and a short position represents the amount of such sales that have not been covered by subsequent purchases. A covered short position is a short position that is not greater than the amount of additional shares for which the underwriters option described above may be exercised. The underwriters may cover any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to cover the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase additional shares pursuant to the option described above. Naked short sales are any short sales that create a short position greater than the amount of additional shares for which the option described above may be exercised. The underwriters must cover any such naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of common stock made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering. The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions. Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions, as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Companys stock, and together with the imposition of the penalty bid, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the common stock. As a result, the price of the common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time. These transactions may be effected on the NYSE, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. The Company estimates that its total expenses of the offering, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $ . The Company has agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. 161 Table of Contents Conflicts of Interest The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerages and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a variety of these services to Parsons Corporation and to persons and entities with relationships with Parsons Corporation, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Affiliates of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, MUFG Securities Americas Inc. and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. are each a lender under the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility. A portion of the net proceeds from this offering will be used to repay borrowings under the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility. As a result, we expect that more than 5% of the net proceeds from this offering will be paid to affiliates of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, MUFG Securities Americas Inc. and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. Therefore, this offering is being made in compliance with FINRA Rule 5121. Pursuant to that rule, a qualified independent underwriter, as defined by the FINRA rules, must have participated in the preparation of the registration statement and performed its usual standard of due diligence with respect to that registration statement. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is serving as a qualified independent underwriter and will assume the customary responsibilities of acting as a qualified independent underwriter in conducting due diligence and reviewing and participating in the preparation of this registration statement. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC will not receive any additional compensation for acting as a qualified independent underwriter. We have agreed to indemnify Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC against certain liabilities incurred in connection with acting as a qualified independent underwriter, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of Parsons Corporation (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with Parsons Corporation. The underwriters and their respective affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities and instruments.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and December 29, 2017 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for revenue from contracts with customers in 2018. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Los Angeles, California March 8, 2019, except for the effects of the revision discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, as to which the date is March 22, 2019 We have served as the Companys auditor since at least 1969.

This resulted in a $103.6 million decrease of remaining unsatisfied performance obligations in 2018 for Critical Infrastructure, including $55.8 million within one year, $36.1 million within one to two years, and $11.8 million thereafter. In addition, the Company revised Note 20 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to correct the omission of the segment disclosure for revenue by business line. Management evaluated these errors and concluded that they were not material to the previously issued financial statements. Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of Parsons Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliates which it controls. Interests in joint ventures that are controlled by the Company, or for which the Company is otherwise deemed to be the primary beneficiary, are consolidated. For joint ventures in which the Company does not have a controlling interest, but exerts significant influence, the Company applies the equity method of accounting. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet The unaudited pro forma balance sheet information gives effect to the termination of our S Corporation status in connection with the Companys anticipated initial public offering and the Companys election to be treated as a C Corporation under the Internal Revenue Code, assuming such termination occurred on December 31, 2018. Additionally, the pro forma balance sheet information gives effect to a cash dividend to the Companys existing shareholder in the amount of $2.00 per share, or $52.1 million, which is conditional upon closing of the anticipated initial public offering. The pro forma effect of the conversion to a C Corporation results in an increase in net deferred tax assets of $70.7 million, and the termination of the Companys S Corporation status results in the reclassification of undistributed retained earnings, inclusive of the effects of the pro forma deferred tax and cash dividend adjustments, to additional paid-in capital. As all ESOP shares are contingently redeemable for cash during the 180-day lock up period, pro forma adjustments have not been made to reflect a reclassification of redeemable F-8 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 common stock held by the ESOP from temporary equity to permanent equity, as such reclassification is not expected until the 180-day lock-up period lapses and the interests redeemed by ESOP participants will be settled in shares of the public company. Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statement The unaudited pro forma net income information gives effect to the anticipated conversion of the Company to a C corporation. Prior to such anticipated conversion, the Company was an S corporation and generally not subject to federal income taxes within the United States. The pro forma net income, therefore, includes an adjustment for income tax expense on the income attributable to controlling interest as if the Company had been a C corporation as of December 30, 2017 at an assumed combined federal, state, local and foreign effective income tax rate of 28.77%. The unaudited pro forma basic and diluted net income per share is computed using unaudited pro forma net income. Fiscal Year The Company reports results of operations based on a calendar year end date of December 31 starting in 2018. Prior to 2018, the Company reported results of operations based on a 52- or 53-week periods ending the last Friday on or before December 31. For 2016 and 2017, these dates were December 30, 2016 and December 29, 2017, respectively. 2016 was comprised of 53 weeks and 2017 was comprised of 52 weeks. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. The Companys most significant estimates and judgments involve revenue recognition with respect to the determination of the costs to complete contracts and transaction price; determination of self-insurance reserves; valuation of the Companys fair value of common stock; useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets; calculation of allowance for doubtful accounts; valuation of deferred income tax assets and uncertain tax positions, among others. ESOP The Company maintains a non-leveraged ESOP for eligible employees, for which the Company contributes shares of its own stock to the ESOP trust each year. Shares held by the trust or committed to be contributed to the trust are presented as temporary equity as they include a cash redemption feature that is not solely within the control of the Company. Throughout the year, as employee services are rendered, the Company records compensation expense based on salaries of eligible employees. At each reporting period, the shares held within the ESOP or committed to be contributed to the ESOP are adjusted to their redemption value through an offsetting charge or credit to accumulated deficit. F-9 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 Treasury Stock The Company records treasury stock purchases under the cost method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock. The Company records the reissuance of treasury stock using the first-in, first-out method of accounting. Contributions of 656,027 shares, 596,832 shares and 627,241 shares of common stock were made to the ESOP in fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. In fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018 the Company repurchased 2,480,021 shares, 1,827,737 shares and 1,851,297 shares of common stock from the ESOP, respectively, in connection with the redemption of ESOP participants interests in the ESOP for $148.7 million, $111.4 million and $125.8 million, respectively. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per common share (EPS) is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income by adjusted weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities. Upon contribution to the ESOP, the shares become outstanding and are included within the earnings per share computations. Revenue Recognition On December 30, 2017, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and related ASUs subsequently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (ASC 606) using the modified retrospective method. As a result, the Company revised its accounting policy on revenue recognition and the results for reporting periods beginning after December 29, 2017 are presented under ASC 606. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company follows the five-step process in ASC 606 to recognize revenue: 1. Identify the contract 2. Identify performance obligations 3. Determine the transaction price 4. Allocate the transaction price 5. Recognize revenue Contracts Revenue is derived from long-term contracts with customers whereby the Company provides planning, design, engineering, technical, and construction and program management services. The Company has contracts with the United States federal government that contain provisions requiring compliance with the United States Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the United States Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). These regulations are generally applicable to all of the Companys federal government contracts and are partially or fully incorporated in some local and state agency contracts. Most of the Companys federal government contracts are subject to termination at the convenience of the client. These contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of such termination. The Company enters into the following types of contracts with its customers: Cost-Plus Under cost-plus contracts, the Company is reimbursed for allowable or otherwise defined costs incurred, plus a fee. The contracts may also include incentives for F-10 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 various performance criteria, including quality, timeliness, safety and cost-effectiveness. In addition, costs are generally subject to review by clients and regulatory audit agencies, and such reviews could result in costs being disputed as nonreimbursable under the terms of the contract. Time-and-Materials Under time-and-materials contracts, hourly billing rates are negotiated and charged to clients based on the actual time spent on a project. In certain cases, these contracts may be subject to maximum contract values. In addition, clients reimburse actual out-of-pocket costs for materials and other direct incidental expenditures that are incurred in connection with the performance under the contract. Fixed-Price The Company enters into two types of fixed-price contracts: firm fixed-price (FFP) and fixed-price per unit (FPPU). Under FFP contracts, clients pay an agreed fixed-amount negotiated in advance for a specified scope of work. Contract Costs Contract costs consist of direct costs on contracts, including labor and materials, amounts payable to subcontractors, direct overhead costs and equipment expense (primarily depreciation, fuel, maintenance and repairs). All contract costs are recorded as incurred. Changes to estimated contract costs, either due to unexpected events or revisions to managements initial estimates, for a given project are recognized in the period in which they are determined as estimated at the contract level. Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred unless they are expected to be recovered from the client, generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future and directly relate to an existing or anticipated contract. Costs to mobilize equipment and labor to a job site, prior to substantive work beginning (mobilization costs) are capitalized as incurred and amortized over the expected duration of the contract. Additionally, the Company may incur incremental costs to obtain certain contracts, such as selling and market costs, bid and proposal costs, sales commissions, and legal fees, certain of which can be capitalized if they are recoverable under the contract. Capitalized contract costs are included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and were not material as of December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018. Performance Obligations A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in ASC 606. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. To the extent a contract is deemed to have multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. The Company determines the relative standalone selling price utilizing observable prices for the sale of the underlying goods or services. Contracts are considered to have a single performance obligation if the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts or is not distinct in the context of the contract, which is mainly because the Company provides a significant service of integrating a complex set of tasks and components into a single project or capability. Engineering and construction contracts are generally accounted for as a single performance obligation while our engineering and construction supervision contracts are accounted for as two separate performance obligations. Customers are generally billed as the Company satisfies its performance obligations and payment terms typically range from 30 to 120 days from the invoice date. Billings under certain fixed-price contracts may be based upon the achievement of specified milestones, while some arrangements may require advance customer payment. The Companys contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. F-11 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 Variable Consideration Transaction price for the Companys contracts may include variable consideration, which includes increases to transaction price for approved and unpriced change orders, claims and incentives, and reductions to transaction price for liquidated damages. Change orders, claims and incentives are generally not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration service provided in the context of the contract and are accounted for as a modification of the existing contract and performance obligation. The Company recognizes adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catch-up method. Under this method, the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance is recognized using the adjusted estimate. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, the Company recognizes the total loss in the quarter it is identified. The Company estimates variable consideration for a performance obligation utilizing one of the two prescribed methods, depending on which method better predicts the amount of consideration to which the Company will be entitled (or the amount the Company expects to incur in the case of liquidated damages). Such methods include: (a) the expected value method, whereby the amount of variable consideration to be recognized represents the sum of probability weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts, and (b) the most likely amount method, whereby the amount of variable consideration to be recognized represents the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts. When applying these methods, the Company considers all information that is reasonably available, including historical, current and estimates of future performance. The expected value method is utilized in situations where a contract contains a large number of possible outcomes while the most likely amount method is utilized in situations where a contract has only two possible outcomes. The Company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Companys estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. The effect of variable consideration on the transaction price of a performance obligation is recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. Change Orders Change orders, which are a normal and recurring part of our business, may include changes in specifications or design, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and period of completion of the work. The Company or customer may initiate change orders. Most of our change orders are not distinct from the existing contract and are accounted for as part of that existing contract. The effect of a change order on the transaction price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenues (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenues) on a cumulative catch-up basis. Revenues from unpriced change orders are recognized to the extent of the amounts the Company expects to recover, consistent with our variable consideration policy discussed above. If it is probable that a reversal of revenues will occur, the costs attributable to change orders are treated as contract costs without incremental revenues. To the extent change orders included in the price are not resolved in our favor, there could be reductions in, or reversals of previously reported amounts of, revenues and profits, and charges against current earnings, which could be material. F-12 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 Claims Revenue Claims are amounts in excess of agreed contract prices that the Company seeks to collect from clients or others for customer-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute, or other causes of unanticipated additional contract costs, including factors outside of our control, therefore the Company believe is entitled to additional compensation. Claims revenue, when recorded, is only recorded to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company includes certain claims in the transaction price when the claims are legally enforceable, the Company considers collection to be probable and believe the Company can reliably estimate the ultimate value. The Company continues to engage in negotiations with our customers on our outstanding claims. However, these claims may be resolved at amounts that differ from our current estimates, which could result in increases or decreases in future estimated contract profits or losses. Warranties In most cases, our contracts include assurance-type warranties that the Companys performance is free from material defect and consistent with the specifications of the Companys contracts, which do not give rise to a separate performance obligation. To the extent the warranty terms provide the customer with an additional service, such as extended maintenance services, such warranty is accounted for as a separate performance obligation. Revenue recognized over time The Companys performance obligations are generally satisfied over time as work progresses because of continuous transfer of control to the customer and the Company has the right to bill the customer as costs are incurred. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using an input measure (i.e. costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion) to measure progress. The Company generally uses the cost-to-cost measure of progress method because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as the Company incurs costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Any expected losses on construction-type contracts in progress are charged to earnings, in total, in the period the losses are identified. Right to invoice practical expedient For performance obligations satisfied over time where the Company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the Companys performance to date, the Company recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice. For the Companys reimbursable services contracts, revenue is recognized using the right to invoice practical expedient, or on a cost-to-cost measure of progress method. The Company will select the method that best represents progress on a project. Revenue recognized at a point in time For performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, revenue is recognized when the services are performed, control is transferred and the performance obligation is complete. The Company recognizes revenue at a point in time for vehicle inspection services. Revenue related to the inspection service is recognized for each vehicle inspection at the point the Company has completed the inspection. In the Companys industry, recognition of profit on long-term contracts requires the use of assumptions and estimates related to total contract revenue, total cost at completion, and the measurement of progress towards completion. Estimates, to the extent probable, are continually evaluated as work progresses and are revised when necessary. When a change in estimate is F-13 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 determined to have an impact on contract profit, the Company records a positive or negative adjustment to the consolidated statements of income (loss). For the years ended December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, the Company recognized net operating income decreases related to changes in estimates at completion of $(22.4) million, $(23.8) million and $(2.3) million, respectively, in the consolidated statements of income (loss) resulting from changes in estimates. Refer to the Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements for discussion of the differences between the current revenue recognition criteria under ASC 606 and the Companys previous recognition practices under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition . Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalent investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value, and consist primarily of United States Treasuries, time deposits, and other forms of short-term fixed income investments. Restricted Cash and Investments Restricted cash and investments held in trust accounts represent collateral for certain incentive programs. Accounts Receivable, Net Accounts receivable includes billed and unbilled amounts and are recognized in the period when the Companys rights to receive consideration are unconditional. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the assessment of the clients ability to pay. In addition to such allowances, there are often items in dispute or being negotiated that may require us to make an estimate as to the ultimate outcome. Past due receivable balances are written off when internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amounts due. Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities In connection with the adoption of ASC 606 on December 30, 2017, the Company revised its policy related to contract assets and contract liabilities. Projects with performance obligations recognized over time that have revenue recognized to date in excess of cumulative billings and unbilled accounts receivable, are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as Contract assets. Contract retentions, included in contract assets, represent amounts withheld by clients, in accordance with underlying contract terms, until certain conditions are met or the project is completed. The operating cycle for certain long-term contracts may extend beyond one year, and accordingly, collection of retainage on those contracts may extend beyond one year. Contract assets are reclassified to accounts receivable when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities on uncompleted contracts represent the amounts of cash collected from clients, billings to clients on contracts in advance of work performed and revenue recognized and provisions for losses. The majority of these amounts are expected to be earned within 12 months and are classified as current liabilities. F-14 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 Refer to the Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements for further discussion of the impact of adopting ASC 606. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, and accounts receivables. The Companys cash is primarily held with major banks and financial institutions throughout the world. At times, cash balances may be in excess of the amount insured. The Company is involved in a significant volume of contracts with the United States federal government and state and local governments. Approximately 35%, 36% and 42% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and approximately 25% and 29% of accounts receivable as of December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively, were derived from contracts with the United States federal government. No other customers represented 10% or more of consolidated revenues or accounts receivable in any of the periods presented. In order to mitigate the credit risk associated with customers, the Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and are shown net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the lease. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss thereon is included in net income. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances change that indicate they may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition are less than their carrying amount, in which case the asset is written down to its fair value. Business Combinations The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method, under which the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. The determination of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the Company to make estimates and use valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available. The Company adjusts the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, during the measurement period of up to one year after the acquisition closing date as the Company obtains more information as to facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognized separate from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred. F-15 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 Consolidation of Joint Ventures and Variable Interest Entities The Company participates in joint ventures, which include partnerships and partially-owned limited liability corporations, to bid, negotiate and complete specific projects. The Company is required to consolidate these joint ventures if it holds the majority voting interest or if the joint venture is determined to be a variable interest entity (VIE) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary, as described below. A VIE is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack the ability to make certain decisions, the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive expected residual returns; or (c) an equity investor has voting rights that are disproportionate to its economic interest and substantially all of the entitys activities are on behalf of the investor with disproportionately low voting rights. The Companys VIEs may be funded through contributions, loans and/or advances from the joint venture partners or by advances and/or letters of credit provided by clients. Certain VIEs are directly governed, managed, operated and administered by the joint venture partners. Others have no employees and, although these entities own and hold the contracts with the clients, the services required by the contracts are typically performed by the joint venture partners or by other subcontractors. The Company is considered the primary beneficiary and required to consolidate a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact that VIEs economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of that VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary, significant assumptions and judgments include the following: (1) identifying the significant activities and the parties that have the power to direct them; (2) reviewing the governing board composition and participation ratio; (3) determining the equity, profit and loss ratio; (4) determining the management-sharing ratio; (5) reviewing employment terms, including which joint venture partner provides the project manager; and (6) reviewing the funding and operating agreements. Examples of significant activities currently being performed by the Companys significant consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures include engineering and design services; management consulting services; procurement and construction services; program management; construction management; and operations and maintenance services. If the Company determines that the power to direct the significant activities is shared by two or more joint venture parties, then there is no primary beneficiary and no party consolidates the VIE. In making the shared-power determination, the Company analyzes the key contractual terms, governance, related party and de facto agency as they are defined in the accounting standard, and other arrangements. Goodwill Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as of the end of November or on an interim basis if indicators of potential impairment exist. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure. The Companys reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments where discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company may decide to first perform a qualitative assessment, or step zero impairment test, to determine whether it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred. If the Company does not perform a qualitative assessment, or F-16 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 if the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units exceeds their carrying amounts, the Company performs a quantitative assessment and calculates the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount the carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The Companys decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, including the significance of the excess of the Companys estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments, and the date of its acquisitions, if any. Intangible Assets Intangible assets with finite lives arise from business acquisitions and are amortized based on the period over which the contractual or economic benefit of the intangible assets are expected to be realized or on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the underlying assets, ranging from one to ten years. These primarily consist of customer relationships, developed technology, backlog, and covenants not to compete. When indicators of a potential impairment exist, the Company assesses the recoverability of the unamortized balance of its intangible assets by first comparing undiscounted expected cash flows associated with the asset, or the asset group they are part of, to its carrying value. Should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the intangible assets would be recognized as an impairment loss. Income Taxes The Company calculates its provision for income tax using the liability method of accounting. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets to reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of the Companys assets and liabilities. Deferred tax balances are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates and other factors that cause changes in the amounts the Company estimates eventually will become payable. The Company converted to S corporation status in 1999 and generally is not subject to federal income tax and certain state income tax on its income. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. The Company believes its estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. The Company recognizes both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Foreign Currency Translation The Companys reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar. The functional currency of the Companys foreign entities is typically the currency of the primary environment in which they operate. For F-17 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 foreign entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, the assets and liabilities are translated based on exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while the income and expense accounts are translated using the average exchange rates during the period. Translation gains or losses, net of income tax effects, are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Transaction gains and losses due to movements in exchange rates between the functional currency and the currency in which a foreign currency transaction is denominated are recognized as Other income (expense), net in the Companys consolidated statements of income (loss). Self-Insurance The Company typically utilizes third-party insurance subject to varying retention levels or self-insurance. The Company is self-insured for a portion of the losses and liabilities primarily associated with workers compensation, general, professional, automobile, employee matters, certain medical plans, and project-specific liability claims. Losses are accrued based upon the Companys estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience and certain actuarial assumptions, as provided by an independent actuary. The estimate of self-insurance liability includes an estimate of incurred but not reported claims, based on data compiled from historical experience. Restructuring The Company began implementing a restructuring program in late 2015 to reorganize its business operations to better serve its customers, streamline its reporting structure and simplify layers of management with the objective of improving operational efficiency, reduce costs and better position the Company to achieve future organic growth. Actions included involuntary terminations and exiting operations in certain geographical regions. The Company recognized $12.4 million of restructuring expenses in Indirect, general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 30, 2016. As of December 30, 2016, the Company accrued $1.6 million for restructuring costs in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, which were fully paid during the year ended December 29, 2017. As of December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, there were no accrued amounts related to the restructuring program. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements The Company adopted ASC 606 on December 30, 2017, using the modified retrospective method, which provides for a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning 2018 retained earnings for those uncompleted contracts impacted by the adoption of the new standard. For contracts that were modified before the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented in accordance with ASC 606 the Company has not retrospectively restated the contract for those modifications. The Company instead reflected the aggregate effect of all modifications when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price. The core principle of ASC 606 is that revenue will be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects consideration for which entitlement is expected in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the Company began to separately present contract assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Contract assets include amounts due under contractual retainage F-18 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 provisions as well as revenue recognized to date in excess of cumulative billings and unconditional unbilled accounts receivable that were previously presented as unbilled accounts receivable. Contract liabilities include billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings as well as provisions for losses that were previously separately presented. The difference between the recognition criteria under ASC 606 and the Companys previous recognition practices under the revenue recognition guidance, ASC Topic 605-35, was recognized through a cumulative effect adjustment that was made to the opening balance sheet of accumulated deficit as of December 30, 2017. Consistent with the modified retrospective transition approach, the comparative 2016 and 2017 periods were not adjusted to conform to the current period presentation. The cumulative effect of adopting ASC 606 was primarily due to combining certain deliverables that were previously considered separate deliverables into a single performance obligation and the transition of certain cost-type contracts into the cost-to-cost measure of progress method. The cumulative effect adjustment was an increase to accumulated deficit of $4.7 million as of December 30, 2017 as well as the following cumulative effect adjustments:  An increase to contract assets of $2.5 million;  An increase to deferred tax assets of $0.1 million;  An increase to contract liabilities of $7.2 million; and  An increase to non-controlling interests of $0.1 million The following table presents how the adoption of ASC 606 affected certain line items in the consolidated statement of income (loss) (in thousands): For the year ended December 31, 2018 Balances Without Adoption of ASC 606 Adjustments Due to ASC 606 As Reported Revenue $ 3,560,930 $ (422 ) $ 3,560,508 Direct costs of contracts 2,794,644 361 2,795,005 Income before income tax expense 260,586 (783 ) 259,803 Income tax expenses 20,329 38 20,367 Net income including noncontrolling interests 240,257 (821 ) 239,436 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 17,112 (13 ) 17,099 Net income attributable to Parsons Corporation 223,145 (808 ) 222,337 F-19 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 The following table presents how the adoption of ASC 606 affected certain line items in the consolidated balance sheet (in thousands): As of December 31, 2018 Balances Without Adoption of ASC 606 Adjustments Due to ASC 606 As Reported Accounts receivable, net $ 1,137,411 $ (514,125 ) $ 623,286 Contract assets  515,319 515,319 Deferred tax assets 5,655 25 5,680 Contract liabilities  208,576 208,576 Billings in excess of costs 186,696 (186,696 )  Provision for contract losses 15,206 (15,206 )  Retained earnings 17,990 (5,545 ) 12,445 Noncontrolling interests 46,371 90 46,461 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows, Classification of Certain Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this ASU in 2018 and retrospectively applied to all years presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and its adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated statements of cash flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). ASU 2016-18 requires an entity to include in its cash and cash-equivalent balances in the statement of cash flows those amounts that are deemed to be restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. The Company adopted this ASU in 2018 and retrospectively applied to all years presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and its adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated statements of cash flows. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other than Inventory. This ASU requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The updated guidance also requires entities to disclose a comparison of income tax expense or benefit with statutory expectations and disclose the types of temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to a significant portion of deferred income taxes. The Company adopted this guidance as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 and its adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. ASU 2017-04 simplifies the test for goodwill impairment by removing the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted the new standard as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 and its adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This ASU clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of F-20 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. The Company adopted this ASU as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 and its adoption did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 provides revised guidance related to the accounting and reporting of leases, including a requirement for lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The guidance is effective for the annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this ASU during the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective method that will result in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. The new guidance will be applied to leases that exist or are entered into on or after January 1, 2019 without adjusting comparative periods in the financial statements. While the Company is currently assessing the impact this update will have to the consolidated financial statements, the standard requires lessees to record the rights and obligations created by leases with terms of more than 12 months on its consolidated balance sheets as right of use assets and lease liabilities. Our current minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases are disclosed in Note 14. 3. Acquisitions Polaris Alpha On May 31, 2018, the Company acquired a 100% ownership interest in Polaris Alpha, a privately owned, advanced technology-focused provider of innovative mission solutions for complex defense, intelligence, and security customers, as well as other U.S. federal government customers, for $489.1 million paid in cash. The Company borrowed $260 million under the credit agreement, as described in Note 11, to partially fund the acquisition. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recognized $6.2 million of acquisition related expenses in Indirect, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income (loss) for the period ended December 31, 2018, including legal fees, consulting fees, and other miscellaneous direct expenses associated with the acquisition. Polaris Alpha enhances the Companys artificial intelligence and data analytics expertise with new technologies and solutions. Customers of both companies will benefit from existing, complementary technologies and increased scale, enabling end-to-end solutions under the shared vision of rapid prototyping and agile development.

Amortization expense of $30.3 million related to these intangible assets was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018. The entire value of goodwill of $243.5 million was assigned to the Parsons Federal reporting unit and represents synergies expected to be realized from this business combination. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. The amount of revenue generated by Polaris Alpha since the acquisition and included within consolidated revenues for 2018 is $227.3 million. The Company has determined that the presentation of net income from the date of acquisition is impracticable due to the integration of general corporate functions upon acquisition. F-22 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 Supplemental Pro Forma Information (Unaudited) Supplemental information on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the acquisition executed during the fiscal years ended December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, had been consummated as of the beginning of the comparative period as follows (in thousands): 2017 2018 (unaudited) (unaudited) Pro forma Revenue $ 3,361,626 $ 3,713,804 Pro forma Net Income 44,145 208,762 The unaudited pro forma supplemental information is based on estimates and assumptions which the Company believes are reasonable and reflects the pro forma impact of additional amortization related to the fair value of acquired intangible assets, pro forma impact of reflecting acquisition costs, which consisted of legal, advisory and due diligence fees and expenses, as of the assumed acquisition date, and the additional pro forma interest expense related to the borrowings under the credit agreement, for the years ended December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018. This supplemental pro forma information has been prepared for comparative purposes and does not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been consummated during the periods for which pro forma information is presented. Williams Electric On October 6, 2017, the Company acquired a 100% ownership interest in the equity of Williams Electric Company, Inc. (WEC), a specialty contractor delivering global control system integration and energy infrastructure solutions to U.S. Government customers, for $26.4 million, the entirety of which was paid in cash at closing. WEC aligns with the Companys strategy to grow its leadership position in protecting critical infrastructure assets from threats targeting connected operational technologies, including control systems. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recognized $0.3 million of acquisition-related expenses in Indirect, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income (loss) for the period ended December 29, 2017, including legal fees, consultation fees, and other miscellaneous direct expenses associated with the acquisition.

During 2018, the Company finalized the valuation of assets and liabilities of WEC in the third quarter of 2018. In doing so, measurement period adjustments were made to reflect changes to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, which resulted in a net increase in goodwill of $0.9 million. These adjustments related to a decrease in accounts receivable. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. 4. Contracts with Customers Disaggregation of Revenue The Companys contracts contain both fixed price and cost reimbursable components. Contract types are based on the component that represents the majority of the contract. The following table presents revenue disaggregated by contract type (in thousands): December 31, 2018 Fixed price $ 1,124,934 Time-and-Materials 961,759 Cost plus 1,473,815 Total $ 3,560,508 Refer to Note 20 for the Companys revenues by business lines. Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities These contract assets and contract liabilities balances at December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 were as follows (in thousands): in thousands of US dollars ($) December 29, 2017 December 31, 2018 $ change % change Contract assets $ 506,963 $ 515,319 $ 8,356 1.6 % Contract liabilities 298,657 208,576 (90,081 ) (30.2 )% Net contract assets (liabilities)(1) $ 208,306 $ 306,743 $ 98,437 47.3 % (1) Total contract retentions included in net contract assets (liabilities) were $89.7 as of December 30, 2017. Total contract retentions included in net contract assets (liabilities) were $89.6 as of December 31, 2018, of which $46.3 million are not expected to be paid in F-24 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 fiscal 2019. Contract assets at December 31, 2018 include approximately $47.1 million related to unapproved change orders, claims, and requests for equitable adjustment. For the year ended December 31, 2018, no material losses were recognized related to the collectability of claims, unapproved change orders, and requests for equitable adjustment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized revenue of approximately $168.6 million that was included in the corresponding contract liability balance at December 30, 2017. The change in contract assets and contract liabilities was the result of normal business activity and not significantly impacted by other factors, except as follows:  Acquired contract assets of $35.2 million  Acquired contract liabilities of $3.5 million  Reversal of provision for contract losses of $133.1 million, of which $55.1 million was recorded as an increase in revenue with the remainder recorded as other income There was no significant impairment of contract assets recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized revenues of $34.2 million and $12.9 million due to change orders and claims, respectively, related to changes in transaction price associated with performance obligations that were satisfied or partially satisfied. These amounts represent managements estimates of additional contract revenues that had been earned and were probable of collection. The amount ultimately realized by the Company cannot currently be determined but could be significantly higher or lower than the estimated amount. Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Unsatisfied Performance Obligations The Companys remaining unsatisfied performance obligations (RUPO) as of December 31, 2018 represent a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. The Company had $5.3 billion in RUPO as of December 31, 2018. RUPO will increase with awards of new contracts and decrease as the Company performs work and recognize revenue on existing contracts. Projects are included within RUPO at such time the project is awarded and agreement on contract terms has been reached. The difference between RUPO and backlog relates to unexercised option years that are included within backlog and the value of IDIQ contracts included in backlog for which delivery orders have not been issued for the Federal Solutions segment. Our RUPO are comprised of: (a) original transaction price, (b) change orders for which written confirmations from our customers have been received, (c) pending change orders for which the Company expects to receive confirmations in the ordinary course of business, and (d) claim amounts that the Company has made against customers for which it has determined that it has a legal basis under existing contractual arrangements and a significant reversal of revenue is not probable, less revenue recognized to date.

Unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue recognized but not yet billed pursuant to contract terms or billed after the period end date. Substantially all unbilled receivables as of December 31, 2018 are expected to be billed and collected within 12 months. Unbilled accounts receivable at December 29, 2017 include approximately $50.8 million related to unapproved change orders, claims, and requests for equitable adjustment. The Company regularly evaluates these amounts and records adjustments to operating income when recoverability is deemed to have changed. For the year ended December 29, 2017, no material losses were recognized related to the collectability of claims, unapproved change orders, and requests for equitable adjustment. The allowance for doubtful accounts was determined based on consideration of trends in actual and forecasted credit quality of clients, including delinquency and payment history, type of client, such as a government agency or commercial sector client, and general economic conditions and particular industry conditions that may affect a clients ability to pay. 6. Goodwill The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reporting segment for fiscal years ended December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 (in thousands): December 30, 2016 Acquisitions Impairment Foreign Exchange December 29, 2017 Federal Solutions $ 412,168 $ 10,271 $  $  $ 422,439 Critical Infrastructure 70,528  3,819 74,347 Total $ 482,696 $ 10,271 $  $ 3,819 $ 496,786 F-26 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 December 29, 2017 Acquisitions Impairment Foreign Exchange December 31, 2018 Federal Solutions $ 422,439 $ 244,402 $  $  $ 666,841 Critical Infrastructure 74,347  (4,250 ) 70,097 Total $ 496,786 $ 244,402  $ (4,250 ) $ 736,938 The Company performs a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis for each reporting unit that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding industry economic factors and future profitability. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $84.7 million in the year ended December 30, 2016 associated with goodwill and intangible assets of its legacy Parsons Environment and Infrastructure reporting unit. For the years ended December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, the Company performed a quantitative analysis for all reporting units. It was determined that the fair value of all reporting units exceeded their carrying values. As a result, no goodwill impairments were identified for those periods. 7.

The Company incurred approximately $2.0 million of costs in connection with this amendment. Under the agreement, the Companys revolving credit facility was increased from $500 million to $550 million and the term of the agreement was extended through November 2022. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Companys option, at either the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin, or Libor plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for Base Rate loans is a range of 0.125% to 1.00% and the applicable margin for Libor loans is a range of 1.125% to 2.00%, both based on the leverage ratio of the Company at the end of each fiscal quarter. The rates at December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 were 3.067% and 4.253%, respectively. Borrowings under this Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Companys operating subsidiaries. Letters of credit commitments outstanding under this agreement aggregated approximately $69.4 million and $49.8 million at December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which reduced borrowing limits available to the Company. On July 1, 2014, the Company finalized a private placement whereby the Company raised an aggregate amount of $250.0 million in debt repayable as follows (in thousands): Tranche Debt Amount Maturity Date Interest Rate Senior Note, Series A $ 50,000 July 15, 2021 4.44 % Senior Note, Series B 100,000 July 15, 2024 4.98 % Senior Note, Series C 60,000 July 15, 2026 5.13 % Senior Note, Series D 40,000 July 15, 2029 5.38 % The Company incurred approximately $1.1 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the private placement. On August 10, 2018, the Company finalized an amended and restated intercreditor agreement related to this private placement to more closely align certain covenants F-29 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 and definitions with the terms under the 2017 amended and restated Credit Agreement and incurred approximately $0.5 million of additional issuance costs. These costs are presented as a direct deduction from the debt on the face of the balance sheet. Amortization of debt issuance costs approximated $0.1 million for the years ended December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018. Interest expense related to the Senior Notes approximated $12.6 million, $12.4 million and $12.4 million for the years ended December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense are recorded in Interest expense on the consolidated statements of income (loss). The Company made interest payments related to the Senior Notes of approximately $12.4 million during the periods ended December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018. Interest payable of approximately $5.7 million is recorded in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively, related to the Senior Notes. The Credit Agreement and private placement includes various covenants, including restrictions on indebtedness, liens, acquisitions, investments or dispositions, payment of dividends and maintenance of certain financial ratios and conditions. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018. The Company also has in place several secondary bank credit lines for issuing letters of credit, principally for foreign contracts, to support performance and completion guarantees. Letters of credit commitments outstanding under these bank lines aggregated approximately $200.6 million and $223.0 million at December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Using a discounted cash flow technique that incorporates a market interest yield curve with adjustments for duration, optionality, and risk profile, the Company has determined that the fair value (level 2) of its debt approximates the carrying value. 12. Other Long-term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands): 2017 2018 Self-insurance liability $ 83,293 $ 99,813 Deferred rent 14,059 15,966 Reserve for uncertain tax positions 9,082 9,890 Capital lease obligations  935 Other long term liabilities  1,259 Total other long-term liabilities $ 106,434 $ 127,863 Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the Companys reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of uncertain tax positions. 13. Income Taxes In 1999, the Company filed a voluntary election to change its tax status from a C corporation to an S corporation for federal and certain state income tax purposes. The election is retroactive to the beginning of fiscal year 1999 and allows the Company to pass income or losses directly to its shareholder, the ESOP, without assessment of federal and certain states income taxes.

The Company considers all negative and positive evidence, including the weight of the evidence, to determine if valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are required. In 2018, the Company adjusted valuation allowances to reflect the net reversal of certain foreign deferred tax assets totaling approximately $(2.2) million with respect to certain net operating losses and intangible assets. A valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on the assessment of positive and negative evidence, including estimates of future taxable income necessary to realize future deductible amounts. The valuation allowance was $6.7 million at December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, foreign operating loss and capital loss carryforwards were approximately $64.0 million, of which approximately $28.0 million do not expire and approximately $36.0 million expire if not used between 2019 and 2038. F-32 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of uncertain tax positions is as follows (in thousands): 2016 2017 2018 Beginning of year $ 6,497 $ 7,827 $ 7,137 Increasestax positions in current year 1,476 1,134 1,094 Increasestax positions in prior periods 124 319 1,301 Reductionstax positions in prior periods (1 ) (1,629 ) (1,656 ) Settlements (39 ) (361 )  Lapse of statute limitations (230 ) (153 ) (31 ) 7,827 7,137 7,845 Interest and penalties 1,732 1,945 2,045 End of year $ 9,559 $ 9,082 $ 9,890 In the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that a reduction of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest may occur due to a resolution of certain tax matters, which could include payments on those tax matters, and as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. An estimate of that possible reduction cannot be made at this time. The statutory periods for examining the Companys federal income tax returns through fiscal year 2014 have expired. The Company remains subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the years 2015  2018 and certain state and foreign jurisdictions for the years 2010  2018. The Company files income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions, including the U.S., and numerous U.S. states and non-U.S. jurisdictions around the world. The statute of limitations varies by jurisdiction in which the Company operates. Because of the number of jurisdictions in which the Company files tax returns, in any given year the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions may expire without examination within the 12-month period from the balance sheet date. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Act). The Act incorporates several new provisions into the law that will not have any meaningful impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements since the Company is currently not subject to Federal income tax as an ESOP owned S Corporation. 14. Commitments and Contingencies Commitments The Companys principal noncancelable operating lease agreements, primarily for office space and automation equipment, provide for minimum rentals as follows (in thousands): 2019 $ 67,879 2020 50,959 2021 42,509 2022 35,864 2023 29,429 Thereafter 50,025 $ 276,665 F-33 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 Rental expense for the years ended December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 was $76.0 million, $73.3 million and $ 79.8 million, respectively, and is recorded in Indirect, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income (loss). Contingencies During the second half of fiscal 2013, a California state court issued a number of preliminary judgments with the final judgment being rendered in early fiscal 2014 in favor of the plaintiff in a lawsuit against a joint venture in which the Company is the managing partner and the only other partner is bankrupt. The Company recorded a loss of $98.8 million for the year ended December 27, 2013 as a result of these judgments, which included the reversal of $55.1 million in previously recognized revenue. For each of the years ended December 30, 2016 and December 29, 2017, the Company recorded post-judgment interest of $9.3 million in (Interest and other expense) gain associated with claim on long-term contract in the consolidated statements of income (loss). In addition, for the years ended December 30, 2016 and December 29, 2017, the Company recorded other expenses of $0.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in Interest and other expense associated with claim on long-term contract. $129.9 million is accrued for this matter in Provision for contract losses on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2017. Post judgment interest was accrued through May 2018 when a total of $133.1 million was accrued in Provision for contract losses of consolidated joint ventures on the consolidated balance sheet. On February 28, 2018, the California Court of Appeals vacated the judgement, and in doing so, the appellate court remanded the case to the trial court for the sole purpose of entering a new and final judgement in favor of the Company. On April 9, 2018, the appellate court ruling was appealed by the counterparty to the California Supreme Court. On June 13, 2018, the California Supreme Court denied the counterpartys appeal. As a result, in the second quarter of 2018 the Company reversed $133.1 million accrued in Provision for contract losses on consolidated joint ventures on the consolidated balance sheet, resulting in a net gain of $129.7 million on the consolidated statements of income, of which $55.1 million was recorded as an increase in revenue with the remainder recorded as other income. On or about March 1, 2017, the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board, or the JPB, filed a lawsuit against Parsons Transportation Group, Inc., or PTG, in the Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo, in connection with a positive train control project on which PTG was engaged prior to termination of its contract by the JPB. PTG had previously filed a lawsuit against the JPB for breach of contract and wrongful termination. The JPB seeks damages in excess of $100.0 million, which the Company is currently disputing. In addition to filing a complaint for breach of contract and wrongful termination, the Company has denied the allegations raised by the JPB and, accordingly, filed affirmative defenses. The Company is currently defending against the JPBs claims and the parties are still engaged in discovery. The Company also has a professional liability insurance policy to the extent the JPB proves any errors or omissions occurred. At this time, it is too soon to determine the outcome of the litigation or assess the potential range of exposure, if any. The Company has also filed a third party claim against a subcontractor for indemnification in connection with this matter. In September 2015, a former Parsons employee filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama against us as a qui tam relator on behalf of the United States (the Relator) alleging violation of the False Claims Act. The United States government did not intervene in this matter as it is allowed to do so under the statute. The Company filed a motion to F-34 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that the Relator did not meet the applicable statute of limitations. The District Court granted the motion to dismiss. The Relators attorney appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals of the Eleventh Circuit, which ultimately ruled in favor of the Relator, and the Company petitioned the United States Supreme Court to review the decision. The Supreme Court accepted the petition and the case has been briefed and is scheduled for hearing on March 19, 2019. At this time, it is too soon to determine the outcome of the litigation or assess the potential range of exposure, if any. Federal government contracts are subject to audits, which are performed for the most part by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). Audits by the DCAA and other agencies consist of reviews of our overhead rates, operating systems and cost proposals to ensure that we account for such costs in accordance with the CAS. If the DCAA determines we have not accounted for such costs in accordance with the CAS, the DCAA may disallow these costs. The disallowance of such costs may result in a reduction of revenue and additional liability for the Company. Historically, the Company has not experienced any material disallowed costs as a result of government audits. However, the Company can provide no assurance that the DCAA or other government audits will not result in material disallowances for incurred costs in the future. All audits of costs incurred on work performed through 2009 have been closed, and years thereafter remain open. The Company is subject to various lawsuits, claims and assessments which are routine to the nature of its business. Additionally, the Company has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injuries as a result of contact with asbestos products at various project sites. The Company believes that any significant costs relating to these claims will be reimbursed by applicable insurance. Although there can be no assurance that these matters will be resolved favorably, management believes that their ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company accrues a liability when management believes it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company records a corresponding receivable for costs covered under the insurance policies. 15. Retirement and Other Benefit Plans The Companys principal retirement benefit plan is the ESOP, a stock bonus plan, established in 1975 to cover eligible employees of the Company and certain affiliated companies. Contributions of treasury stock to ESOP are made annually in amounts determined by the Companys board of directors and are held in trust for the sole benefit of the participants. Shares allocated to a participants account are fully vested after six years of credited service, or in the event(s) of reaching age 65, death or disability while an active employee of the Company. All of the Companys common stock was acquired by the ESOP in conjunction with a reorganization in 1984, which was financed by the Company. Upon retirement, death, termination due to permanent disability, a severe financial hardship, or the exercise of diversification rights, participants interests in their ESOP accounts are redeemable at the current price per share of the stock. Such per share prices are established by the ESOP trustee, taking into account, among other things, the advice of a third-party valuation consultant for the ESOP trustee as well as the ESOP trustees knowledge of the Company, as of the end of the plan year preceding distribution. F-35 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 Under the terms of the ESOP plan, when participants hold shares that are not readily tradeable, the Company is obligated to redeem eligible participants interests in their ESOP accounts for cash upon an employees election. All shares held by the ESOP are eventually redeemable in the future for cash at the option of the holder once vesting and eligibility requirements have been met. The Company presents all shares held by the ESOP as temporary equity on the consolidated balance sheet at their redemption value. Total ESOP contribution expense was approximately $41.8 million, $40.6 million and $47.0 million for the years ended December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and is recorded in Direct costs of contracts and Indirect, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income (loss). At December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, 27,283,904 shares and 26,059,848 shares of the Companys stock were held by the ESOP which the Company recorded at their redemption value of $1.9 billion. During the years ended December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, the Company did not declare any dividends. The Company also maintains a defined contribution plan (the 401(k) Plan). Substantially all domestic employees are entitled to participate in the 401(k) Plan, subject to certain minimum requirements. The Companys contribution to the 401(k) Plan for the years ended December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 amounted to $14.2 million, $15.8 million and $17.1 million, respectively. As part of an acquisition in 2014, the Company acquired a defined contribution pension plan, a defined benefit pension plan, and supplemental retirement plan. For the defined contribution pension plan, the Company contributes a base amount plus an additional amount based upon a predetermined formula. At December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, the defined benefit pension plan was in a net asset position of $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, which is recorded in Other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 16. Investments in and Advances to Joint Ventures The Company participates in joint ventures to bid, negotiate and complete specific projects. The Company is required to consolidate these joint ventures if it holds the majority voting interest or if the Company meets the criteria under the consolidation model, as described below. The Company performs an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give the Company a controlling financial interest in a VIE for which the Company is the primary beneficiary and should, therefore, be consolidated. Such analysis requires the Company to assess whether it has the power to direct the activities of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company analyzed all of its joint ventures and classified them into two groups: (1) joint ventures that must be consolidated because they are either not VIEs and the Company holds the majority voting interest, or because they are VIEs and the Company is the primary beneficiary; and (2) joint ventures that do not need to be consolidated because they are either not VIEs and the Company holds a minority voting interest, or because they are VIEs and the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Many of the Companys joint venture agreements provide for capital calls to fund operations, as necessary; however, such funding is infrequent and is not anticipated to be material. F-36 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 Letters of credit outstanding described in Note 11 that relate to project ventures are approximately $80.6 million and $76.8 million at December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively. In the table below, aggregated financial information relating to the Companys joint ventures is provided because their nature, risk and reward characteristics are similar. None of the Companys current joint ventures that meet the characteristics of a VIE are individually significant to the consolidated financial statements. Consolidated Joint Ventures The following represents financial information for consolidated joint ventures included in the consolidated financial statements (in thousands): 2017 2018 Current assets $ 231,041 $ 287,227 Noncurrent assets 4,201 2,689 Total assets 235,242 289,916 Current liabilities 312,075 199,833 Total liabilities 312,075 199,833 Total joint venture (deficit) equity $ (76,833 ) $ 90,083 2016 2017 2018 Revenue $ 381,437 $ 446,506 $ 540,345 Costs 367,208 426,245 376,628 Net income $ 14,229 $ 20,261 $ 163,717 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests $ 11,161 $ 14,211 $ 17,099 The assets of the consolidated joint ventures are restricted for use only by the particular joint venture and are not available for the Companys general operations. Refer to Note 14 for discussion of liabilities, interest and other expenses recorded in connection with the 2013 judgment related to one of the Companys consolidated joint ventures. Unconsolidated Joint Ventures The Company accounts for its unconsolidated joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the Company recognizes its proportionate share of the net earnings of these joint ventures as Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statements of income (loss). The Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its investments in unconsolidated VIEs is typically limited to the aggregate of the carrying value of the investment and future funding commitments. F-37 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 The following represents the financial information of the Companys unconsolidated joint ventures as presented in their unaudited financial statements (in thousands): 2017 2018 Current assets $ 756,197 $ 707,457 Noncurrent assets 761,067 876,385 Total assets 1,517,264 1,583,842 Current liabilities 524,972 560,306 Noncurrent liabilities 683,142 813,269 Total liabilities 1,208,114 1,373,575 Total joint venture equity $ 309,150 $ 210,267 Investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures $ 71,578 $ 63,560 2016 2017 2018 Revenue $ 1,908,151 $ 2,114,903 $ 1,773,037 Costs 1,776,216 1,988,569 1,661,232 Net income $ 131,935 $ 126,334 $ 111,805 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures $ 35,462 $ 40,086 $ 36,915 The Company received net distributions from its unconsolidated joint ventures of $32.5 million, $31.8 million and $41.9 million for the years ended December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 17. Related Party Transactions The Company often provides services to unconsolidated joint ventures and revenues include amounts related to recovering overhead costs for these services. For the years ended December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, revenues included $127.7 million, $112.1 million and $144.7 million, respectively, related to services the Company provided to unconsolidated joint ventures. For the years ended December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, the Company incurred approximately $96.2 million, $81.8 million and $111.1 million, respectively, of reimbursable costs. Amounts included in the consolidated balance sheet related to services the Company provided to unconsolidated joint ventures is as follows (in thousands): 2017 2018 Accounts receivable $ 39,414 $ 36,050 Billings in excess of costs $ 7,662 $ 5,567 18. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The authoritative guidance on fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (referred to as an exit price). At December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, the Companys financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other liabilities. The fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying values due to their short-term maturities. F-38 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 Investments measured at fair value are based on one or more of the following three valuation techniques:  Market approach Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities;  Cost approach Amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (i.e., replacement cost); and  Income approach Techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on market expectations (including present value techniques, option-pricing models and lattice models). In addition, the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities; Level 2 Pricing inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the derivative instrument; and Level 3 Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurements and unobservable. The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. The following table sets forth assets associated with the pension plan in Note 15 that are accounted for at fair value by Level within the fair value hierarchy. Fair value as of December 29, 2017 (in thousands): Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Mutual funds $ 2,829 $  $  $ 2,829 Fixed income  12,114  12,114 Cash and cash equivalents 85   85 $ 2,914 $ 12,114 $  $ 15,028 Fair value as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Mutual funds $ 2,539 $  $  $ 2,539 Fixed income  10,168  10,168 Cash and cash equivalents 361   361 $ 2,900 $ 10,168 $  $ 13,068 F-39 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 As described in Note 15, the Company acquired a defined contribution pension plan, a defined benefit pension plan, and supplemental retirement plans. At December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, the Company measured the mutual funds held within the defined benefit pension plan at fair value using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible for identical assets. The Company measured the fixed income securities using market bid and ask prices. The inputs that are significant to valuation of fixed income securities are generally observable and therefore have been classified as Level 2. The following table sets forth redeemable common stock associated with the ESOP in Note 15 that is accounted for at fair value by Level within the fair value hierarchy. Fair value as of December 29, 2017 (in thousands): Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Redeemable Common Stock $  $  $ 1,855,305 $ 1,855,305 $  $  $ 1,855,305 $ 1,855,305 Fair value as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Redeemable Common Stock $  $  $ 1,876,309 $ 1,876,309 $  $  $ 1,876,309 $ 1,876,309 As described in Note 15, the Company is obligated to redeem eligible participants interests in their ESOP accounts for cash upon an employees election. All shares held by the ESOP are eventually redeemable in the future for cash at the option of the holder once vesting and eligibility requirements have been met. The Company presents all shares held by the ESOP as temporary equity on the consolidated balance sheet at their redemption value. At December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018, approximately 27,283,904 shares and 26,059,848 shares of the Companys stock were held by the ESOP which the Company recorded at their redemption values of $1.9 billion. The redemption values are based on a share price established by the ESOP trustee, taking into account, among other things, the advice of a third party valuation consultant for the ESOP trustee as well as the ESOP trustees knowledge of the Company. The share price valuation was determined using a combination of income and market based methods that utilized unobservable Level 3 inputs, including significant assumptions such as forecasted revenue and operating margins, working capital requirements, and weighted average cost of capital. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in thousands): 2017 2018 Balance at beginning of year $ 1,739,431 $ 1,855,305 Purchases of treasury stock (111,403 ) (125,814 ) Contributions of treasury stock to ESOP 40,553 47,043 Share price adjustment 186,724 99,775 Balance at end of year $ 1,855,305 $ 1,876,309 F-40 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 19. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period and income available to shareholders. Diluted EPS is computed similar to basic EPS, except the weighted average number of shares outstanding is increased to include the dilutive effects of outstanding stock options and other stock-based awards. There were no dilutive securities outstanding during 2016, 2017 and 2018.

Segments Information The Company operates in two reportable segments: Federal Solutions and Critical Infrastructure. The Federal Solutions segment is a high-end services provider to the U.S. government, delivering timely, cost-effective solutions for mission-critical projects. The segment provides advanced technologies, including cybersecurity, missile defense systems, and subsurface munitions detection, as well as military facility modernization, logistics support, chemical weapon remediation and engineering services. The Critical Infrastructure segment provides integrated design and engineering services for complex physical and digital infrastructure around the globe. The Critical Infrastructure segment is a technology innovator focused on next generation infrastructure. Industry leading capabilities in design and project management allow the Company to deliver significant value to customers by employing cutting edge technologies, improving timelines and reducing costs. The Company defines its reportable segments based on the way the chief operating decision maker (CODM), currently its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of each segment and manages the operations of the Company for purposes of allocating resources among the segments. The CODM evaluates segment operating performance using segment Revenue and segment Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation. The following table summarizes business segment information for the periods presented (in thousands): 2016 2017 2018 Revenues: Federal Solutions $ 1,066,740 $ 1,079,906 $ 1,479,007 Critical Infrastructure 1,972,451 1,937,105 2,081,501 Total revenues $ 3,039,191 $ 3,017,011 $ 3,560,508 The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation as Adjusted EBITDA excluding Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Parsons Corporation, adjusted to include net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and to exclude interest expense (net of F-41 Table of Contents PARSONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 30, 2016, December 29, 2017 and December 31, 2018 interest income), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other items that are not considered in the evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These other items include net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, asset impairment charges, income and expense recognized on litigation matters, expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and other non-recurring transaction costs and expenses related to our prior restructuring.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, due to the judgment being vacated, the Company reversed $133.1 million accrued in Provision for contract losses on consolidated joint ventures on the consolidated balance sheet, resulting in a net gain of $129.7 million on the consolidated statements of income, of which $55.1 million was recorded as an increase in revenue with the remainder recorded in (Interest and other expenses) gain associated with claim on long-term contract. See Note 14. (b) Reflects recognized deferred gains related to sales-leaseback transactions described in Note 9.

Subsequent Events The Company evaluated subsequent events through March 8, 2019, the date on which the financial statements were available to be issued. On January 7, 2019, the Company acquired a 100% ownership interest in OGSystems, an innovative solutions provider with advanced technologies in geospatial intelligence, big data analytics, and threat mitigation, for approximately $300.3 million paid in cash. The Company borrowed $110 .0 million under the Credit Agreement as described in Note 11 and $150.0 million on a short-term loan. The Company is in the process of finalizing its purchase price allocation. Events subsequent to Original Issuance of Financial Statements (unaudited) The Company has evaluated subsequent events through March 22, 2019 and April 12, 2019, the date on which the financial statements were available to be reissued. On March 19, 2019, the United States Supreme Court heard the case between the Company and the Relator. The plaintiff alleges that, as a result of the Companys actions, the United States paid in excess of $1 million per month between February and September 2006 that it should have paid to another contractor, plus $2.9 million to acquire vehicles for the contractor defendant to perform its security services. The lawsuit sought (i) that the Company cease and desist from violating the False Claims Act, (ii) monetary damages equal to three times the amount of damages that the United States has sustained because of the Companys alleged violations, plus a civil penalty of not less than $5,500 and not more than $11,000 for each alleged violation of the False Claims Act, (iii) monetary damages equal to the maximum amount allowed pursuant to §3730(d) of the False Claims Act, and (iv) Relators costs for this action, including recovery of attorneys fees and costs incurred in the lawsuit. At this time, it is too soon to determine the outcome of the litigation or assess the potential range of exposure, if any, and a ruling is not expected until the second quarter of 2019. On April 3, 2019, the Companys board of directors declared a cash dividend to the Companys existing shareholder in the amount of $2.00 per share, or $52.1 million in the aggregate (the IPO Dividend). The payment of the IPO Dividend is conditional upon the closing of the Companys anticipated initial public offering, and payable to the Companys existing shareholder on the day immediately following the closing of the anticipated initial public offering.

ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law authorizes the board of directors of a corporation to grant, and authorizes a court to award, indemnity to officers, directors and other corporate agents. We expect to adopt an certificate of incorporation, which will become effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering, and which will contain provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Consequently, our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for the following:  any breach of their duty of loyalty to our company or our stockholders;  any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;  unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or  any transaction from which they derived an improper personal benefit. Any amendment to, or repeal of, these provisions will not eliminate or reduce the effect of these provisions in respect of any act, omission or claim that occurred or arose prior to that amendment or repeal. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended to provide for further limitations on the personal liability of directors of corporations, then the personal liability of our directors will be further limited to the greatest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. In addition, we expect to adopt bylaws, which will become effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering, and which will provide that we will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any person who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a proceeding), II-1 Table of Contents by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the corporation or, while a director or officer of the corporation, is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred. Our bylaws will also provide that we must pay the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by a director or officer in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, subject to limited exceptions. Further, we have entered into or will enter into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers that may be broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained in the Delaware General Corporation Law. These indemnification agreements require us, among other things, to indemnify our directors and executive officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service. These indemnification agreements also require us to advance all expenses incurred by the directors and executive officers prosecuting, defending, preparing to prosecute or defend, investigating, being or preparing to be a witness in, or otherwise participating in any such action, suit, arbitration, alternate dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or any other actual, threatened or completed proceeding. We believe that these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve as directors and executive officers. The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions that are expected to be included in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and in indemnification agreements that we have entered into or will enter into with our directors and executive officers may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and executive officers for breach of their fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and executive officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and other stockholders. Further, a stockholders investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and executive officers as required by these indemnification provisions. At present, we are not aware of any pending litigation or proceeding involving any person who is or was one of our directors, officers, employees or other agents or is or was serving at our request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, for which indemnification is sought, and we are not aware of any threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification. We have obtained insurance policies under which, subject to the limitations of the policies, coverage is provided to our directors and executive officers against loss arising from claims made by reason of breach of fiduciary duty or other wrongful acts as a director or executive officer, including claims relating to public securities matters, and to us with respect to payments that may be made by us to these directors and executive officers pursuant to our indemnification obligations or otherwise as a matter of law. Certain of our non-employee directors may, through their relationships with their employers, be insured and/or indemnified against certain liabilities incurred in their capacity as members of our board of directors. The underwriting agreement to be filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this registration statement will provide for indemnification by the underwriters of us and our officers and directors for certain liabilities arising under the Securities Act or otherwise.

UNDERTAKINGS. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act, may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange II-4 Table of Contents Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that: (1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. II-5 Table of Contents SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement on Form S-1 to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in Centreville, Virginia, on the 12th day of April, 2019.
