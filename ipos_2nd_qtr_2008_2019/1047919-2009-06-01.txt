AMBIENT CORPORATION Ambient Corporation (referred to herein as we, our, us, Ambient, or the Company) is a pioneering integrator of smart grid communications platforms, creating high-speed Internet Protocols (IP)-based data communications networks over existing medium and low-voltage distribution grids, thereby enabling smart grid applications. The Ambient smart grid platform, known as Ambient Smart Grid™, facilitates a two-way, real-time communications network to serve the “last mile” backhaul necessary for utilities to implement smart grid applications such as Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMI), real-time pricing, Demand Side Management (DSM), Distribution Monitoring and Automation, and direct load control and more. When combined, these applications can offer economic, operational and environmental benefits for utilities, and ultimately the utilitys customers. Dating back to 2000, Ambient has focused on developing communication platforms to enable utility applications throughout a utilitys distribution network. Over the past eight years, Ambient has evolved considerably to remain at the forefront of utility smart grid communication. In 2004, we upgraded our platform, from a 45 Mbps Design of Systems on Silicon (DS2) Broadband over Power Line (BPL) processor, to their second generation 200 Mbps chipset technology that had the potential for a more robust communications network. In 2005, with the integration of Wi-Fi wireless communications in our nodes, we leveraged the advantages of using multiple communications technologies under a single unified platform. In 2007, Ambient integrated both voltage sensing and current sensing capabilities into our products, allowing nodes to provide power quality data back to the utility in real-time, anywhere an enabled node is located. In December 2008, Ambient extended our communications capabilities to include cellular communications in our X2000 node, and subsequently received certification for our latest communication node, the X-3000, to backhaul through Verizon Wireless secure and ubiquitous network. Additionally, our network management system AmbientNMS™, introduced in 2005 was enhanced in 2008 to integrate geographic information systems (GIS) technology allowing for precise mapping and exact outage notification. In 2008, Ambient received purchase orders from Duke Energy to purchase its X2000 and X-3000 communications nodes, license its AmbientNMS™, and acquire engineering support in building out an intelligent grid/intelligent-metering platform, which generated $12.6 million in revenues in the year. As management believes that open standards and interoperability will hasten the deployment of all smart grid technology, Ambient has played a principal role in driving industry standardization efforts through leadership roles in industry associations and standards setting organizations and continues to expand strategic relationships with leading suppliers of critical smart grid technologies. Our goal is to be the leading designer, developer and systems integrator of a turnkey Ambient Smart Grid™ communications platform, incorporating a wide array of communications protocols and smart grid applications such as advanced metering solutions to complement our internally developed energy sensing capabilities. We view the smart grid communications platform to be a key factor for utilities to efficiently integrate increasing portfolios of renewable energy generation into the electrical grid. Ambient was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in June 1996, and to date, we have funded operations primarily through the sale of our securities. In connection with the continued development and upgrade, marketing, and deployment of our products, technology, and services, we anticipate that we will continue to augment our revenue generation capabilities with such capital raises in the future, and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses during the current fiscal year. 1 We recognized revenues of $12,622,353 and $826,593 for the year ended December 31, 2008 and the three months ended March 31, 2009, respectively, representing sales of equipment, software and related network design and installation services from new pilots that were launched in 2008 and 2007. We incurred net losses of $11,294,199 and $4,044,438 for the year ended December 31, 2008 and the three months ended March 31, 2009, respectively. From inception through the third quarter of 2008, we were in the development stage and had insignificant revenues. A development stage activity is generally one in which all efforts are devoted substantially to establishing a new business and even if planned principal operations have commenced, revenues are insignificant. In the fourth quarter of 2008, our management has determined that we were no longer in the development stage as Ambient generated significant reve nues. CORPORATE INFORMATION Our principal offices are located at 79 Chapel Street, Newton, Massachusetts 02458, and our telephone number is (617) 332-0004. We maintain a website at www.ambientcorp.com. Information contained on our website is not part of this Prospectus. RISK FACTORS Investing in shares of our Common Stock involves significant risk. You should consider the information under the caption "RISK FACTORS" beginning on page 4 of this Prospectus in deciding whether to purchase the Common Stock offered under this Prospectus. 2 THE OFFERING Securities offered by the selling stockholders 43,633,331 shares of Common Stock. (1) Shares outstanding before the Offering 721,684,187 (2) Use of Proceeds We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock by the selling stockholders  (1) Refers to shares issuable upon exercise of warrants issued to Kuhns Brothers (Kuhns), an investment firm and a registered broker dealer, or its designees, in connection with certain financings that we consummated between July 2007 and November 2008 and is comprised of the following: to (i) 750,000 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of warrants issued in January 2007 in connection with the retainer of Kuhns as investment advisor to us and (ii) 42,883,331 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of warrants issued as compensation for placement agent services rendered in connection with the above referenced financings. For a description of the agreement between us and the holders of the Warrants and the Other Warrants, see "DESCRIPTION OF THE AGREEMENTS WITH SELLING STOCKHOLDERS". (2) As of June 1, 2009. Does not include (i) up to an aggregate of 55,262,000 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of options granted under our 2000 Equity Incentive Stock Option Plan and our 2002 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan, (ii) any of the shares described in footnote (1) above and (iii) 912,024,999 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of other outstanding convertible securities or upon exercise of other outstanding options and warrants. 3 RISK FACTORS INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW BEFORE YOU PURCHASE ANY OF OUR COMMON STOCK. IF ANY OF THESE RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES ACTUALLY OCCURS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. RISKS CONCERNING OUR BUSINESS OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH DUKE ENERGY IS MATERIAL TO OUR SUCCESS, AND THE TERMINATION OF SUCH RELATIONSHIP FOR ANY REASON MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS. Our immediate business opportunities continue to be largely dependent on the success of our deployments with Duke Energy. We are focusing much of our time, attention and resources on the rollout of the equipment and software delivered to this utility. The success of our endeavors with respect to the deployment is subject to several risks. We depend on third parties to deliver and support reliable components to manufacture and assemble our end products, as well as our engineering team to continue to advance our software products. If we are unable to effectively manage and maintain our relationship with the utility, our business could be materially and adversely affected in its ability to continue, and our operations could be jeopardized. We will likely need to secure additional contracts with this and other utilities to be able to continue our operations in the future, and there is no assurance that other utilities will adopt our smart grid technology or contract with us to provide our services to them. ADVERSE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS AND, IN TURN, OUR OPERATING RESULTS Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. The strength of the global economy has been increasingly uncertain, including difficulties in the real estate and mortgage, volatility in the fuel and other energy costs and problems in the financial services and credit markets. Such macroeconomics factors could affect the budgeting and purchasing behavior of our customers. If economic growth is slowed or uncertain customers may delay or reduce technology purchases. This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, slower adoption of new technologies and increase price competition. Any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations and financial conditions. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN NEEDED, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXPAND EXISTING COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENTS. Management believes that our current available cash resources, as well as anticipated revenues from proceeds, will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the balance of the 2009 fiscal year. However, we may need to raise funds in order to expand existing commercial deployments and/or satisfy any additional significant purchase order that we may receive. At the present time, we have no commitments for any additional funding that may be needed. TO DATE, WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUE, AND THE LOSS OF, OR A SIGNIFICANT SHORTFALL IN ORDERS FROM, KEY CUSTOMERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUE . We have derived a substantial portion of our total revenue from a limited number of customers as a result of the nature of our strategy and target market. During any given fiscal quarter, a small number of customers may account for a significant percentage of our revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, 100% and 99% of our total revenue was accounted for by Duke Energy. Our inability to generate anticipated revenue from our key existing or targeted customers, or a significant shortfall in sales to any of them may significantly reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business. Our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on our ability to effect deployments with new utilities and to continue our deployments with our existing utilities. 4 A DEFAULT BY US UNDER OUR SECURED CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES ISSUED IN 2007 AND 2008 WOULD ENABLE THE NOTE HOLDER TO FORECLOSE ON OUR ASSETS. Between July 31, 2007 and January 15, 2008, we issued $12,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of our Secured Convertible Promissory Notes to Vicis Capital Master Fund (Vicis). The notes are scheduled to mature between July 2010 and January 2011. These notes are secured by a lien on our assets. As of June 1, 2009, Vicis holds approximately 66% of our issued and outstanding common stock. A default by us under these notes would enable Vicis to foreclose on our assets. Any foreclosure could force us to substantially curtail or cease our operations. OTHERS MAY CHALLENGE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. We have filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"), and with the appropriate agencies in foreign countries and other jurisdictions, patent applications with respect to the BPL and Energy Sensing portion of Ambient Smart Grid™ on the medium and low voltage distribution grid. Our portfolio includes twenty-one patents issued or allowed by the USPTO primarily relating to coupling technology, and we have several pending patent applications in the United States and in other jurisdictions. While we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights, it is possible that our rights relating to Ambients Smart Grid™ solution may be challenged and invalidated or circumvented. Further, effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited. Despite efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer, or otherwise use aspects of processes and devices that we may regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary information is difficult, and there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technologies. In the event that our intellectual property protection is insufficient to protect our intellectual property rights, we could face increased competition in the market for technolog ies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. OTHER COMPANIES MAY DEVELOP AND SELL COMPETING PRODUCTS WHICH MAY REDUCE THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR RENDER OUR PRODUCTS OBSOLETE. The smart grid communications marketplace is rapidly evolving and therefore has rapidly changing technological, regulatory and consumer requirements. We will need to continue to maintain and improve our competitive position to keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers, and continue to develop and introduce new products, features and services in a timely and efficient manner. Our competitors include both small companies as well as some of the largest companies in the electronics industry, operating either alone or together with trade associations and partners. There can be no assurance that other companies will not develop products that compete with our products in the future. Some of our potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than our Company. These potential competitors may, among other things, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, obtain more favorable pricing from suppliers and manufacturers and exert more influence on the sales channel than we do. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully with these potential competitors, and these potential competitors may develop or market technologies and products that are more widely accepted than those we are developing or that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. WE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES, AND WE EXPECT THESE LOSSES TO CONTINUE INTO 2009. We are a company engaged in the design, development and marketing of our smart grid communication technology and solutions. We incurred net losses of $4,044,438 and $2,513,390 for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively and $11,294,199 and $15,756,393 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 5 We expect to continue to incur net losses as we further develop, test, and market Ambient Smart Grid™ technology. Our ability to generate and sustain significant additional revenues or achieve profitability will depend upon the factors discussed elsewhere in this "Risk Factors" section. There are no assurances that we will achieve or sustain profitability, or that our operating losses will not increase in the future. If we do achieve profitability, we cannot be certain that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT, OR OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS NOT EFFECTIVE, THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAY BE QUESTIONED AND OUR SHARE PRICE MAY SUFFER. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting. Our independent auditors will be required to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2009. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal controls over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. It is possible that we could discover certain deficiencies in the design and/or operation of our internal controls that could adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data. We have invested and will continue to invest signific ant resources in this process. We are uncertain as to what impact a conclusion that deficiencies exist in our internal control over financial reporting would have on the trading price of our common stock. RISKS CONCERNING OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE VICIS CAPITAL MASTER FUND OWNS A MAJORITY OF AMBIENTS ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK AND WILL THUS BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE OUTCOME OF ALL ISSUES SUBMITTED TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. Contemporaneous with the $8 million investment in our Company in November 2008, Vicis exercised all then outstanding warrants it then held and, as of June 1, 2009, Vicis holds approximately 66% of our issued and outstanding common stock. In addition, if the entire outstanding principal amount of the notes held by Vicis were immediately converted by it into common stock of the Company, it could result in the issuance of an additional 833,333,333 shares of our common stock to Vicis. If Vicis exercises the remaining warrants and is issued the shares from the outstanding principal of the notes it holds, Vicis will then hold a total of 1,309,081,747 shares of our common stock or approximately 84% of the 1,556,400,854 shares of common stock that would be issued and outstanding following such exercises. As a result, Vicis is able to control the outcome of substantially all issues submitted to our stockholders, including the election o f all of our directors. A principal of Vicis also is a member of our board of directors. FUTURE SALES OF COMMON STOCK OR OTHER DILUTIVE EVENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. As of June 1, 2009, we were authorized to issue up to 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 721,684,187 shares were outstanding. As of June 1, 2009, an additional 1,015,757,430 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of outstanding debt securities and the exercise of outstanding options and warrants to purchase common stock and the reservations of shares in the Plans. Many of the above options, warrants and convertible securities contain provisions that require the issuance of increased numbers of shares of common stock upon exercise or conversion in the event of stock splits, redemptions, mergers and other transactions. The occurrence of any such event or the exercise or conversion of any of these options, warrants or convertible securities would dilute the interest in our company represented by each share of common stock and may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. Additionally, our board of directors has the authority, without further action or vote of our stockholders, to issue authorized shares of our common stock that are not reserved for issuance. In addition, in order to raise the amount of capital that we need at the current market price of our common stock, we may need to issue a significant 6 number of shares of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exercisable for a significant number of shares of our common stock. Any of these issuances will dilute the percentage ownership interests of our current stockholders, which will have the effect of reducing their influence on matters on which our stockholders vote, and might dilute the book value and market value of our common stock. Our stockholders may incur additional dilution upon the exercise of currently outstanding or subsequently granted options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE. The market price of our common stock will likely fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control: · Announcements by us of commencement of, changes to, or cancellation of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; · Changes in financial estimates of our revenues and operating results by securities analysts or investors; · Variations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including but not limited to those identified in this "RISK FACTORS " section; · Additions or departures of key personnel; · Future sales of our common stock; · Stock market price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our stock; · Commencement of or involvement in litigation; and/or · Announcements by us, or by our competitors of technological innovations or new products. In addition, the equity markets have experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities issued by high technology companies and that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of those companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. PENNY STOCK REGULATIONS ARE APPLICABLE TO INVESTMENT IN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. Broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in "penny stocks" are regulated by certain penny stock rules adopted by the SEC. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges, provided that current prices and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities are provided by the exchange or system). Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny st ock held in the customer's account. In addition, penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock, the broker-dealer make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to penny stock rules. Many brokers will not deal with penny stocks, restricting the market for our shares of common stock. 7 BECAUSE WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY ANY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, OUR STOCKHOLDERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A RETURN ON THEIR SHARES UNLESS THEY SELL THEM. We intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Prospectus contains some "forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by and the information currently available to our management. When used in this Prospectus, the words "estimate," "project," "believe," "anticipate," "intend," "expect" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements, including those risks discussed in this Prospectus. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Prospectus. Except for special circumstances in which a duty to update arises when prior disclosure becomes materially misleading in light of subsequent circumstances, we do not intend to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Prospectus or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. USE OF PROCEEDS The selling stockholders will receive the net proceeds from sales of the shares of Common Stock included in this Prospectus. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Common Stock by the selling stockholders. We would, however, receive proceeds from the exercise of the Placement Agent Warrants to purchase up to 43,633,331 shares of Common Stock that are held by the selling stockholders, to the extent such warrants are exercised for cash. These warrants may only be exercised on a cashless basis if a registration statement covering the shares issuable under the relevant warrants is not effective at the time of exercise. If the warrants are exercised on a cashless basis, we will not receive proceeds from those exercises. The selling stockholders are not obligated to exercise these warrants, and there can be no assurance that they will do so. If all of these warrants were exercised for cash, we would receive proceeds of approximately $1.55 million. Any proceeds we receive from the exercise of these options and warrants will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. AGREEMENTS WITH THE SELLING STOCKHOLDERS Between July 31, 2007 and January 15, 2008, we raised gross proceeds of $12,500,000 from the private placement of our three year 8% Secured Convertible Promissory Note to Vicis Master Fund Ltd. On April 23, 2008, we raised from Vicis $3,000,000 from the issuance of warrants, exercisable through April 2013, to purchase up to 135,000,000 shares of our Common Stock at a per share exercise price of $0.001. Finally, on November 21, 2008, we and Vicis entered into an agreement, pursuant to which Vicis invested in us an additional $8 million, in consideration of which we reduced the conversion price on the above referenced notes. In January 2007, we and Kuhns Brothers (Kuhns), an investment firm and a registered broker dealer, entered into a placement agency agreement pursuant to which Kuhns provided to us investment banking services. In connection with the entry into the placement agency agreement, we issued to Kuhns warrants to purchase up 750,000 shares of our Common Stock (the Retainer Warrants). Thereafter, in connection with the above referenced transactions, we paid to a Kuhns Brothers (Kuhns), an investment firm and a registered broker dealer which served as placement agent for the above transactions, a cash fee of $615,000 and we issued, between July 31, 2007 and November 21, 2008 warrants to purchase up to 44,266,665 shares of our Common Stock (the Placement Warrants; together with the Retainer Warrants, the Placement Agent Warrants). Of the Placement Warrants issued, warrants for 7,619,047 share s were issued in lieu of the payment of a cash fee of $300,000. The registration 8 statements of which this prospectus forms a part was filed in order to register for resale the shares of Common Stock underlying the Placement Agent Warrants held by Kuhns or its designees, except for warrants for 1,383,334 shares. The Retainer warrants first became exercisable on January 31, 2008 and are exercisable through January 30, 2012 at a per share exercise price of $0.075. The Placement Warrants are exercisable at a share price of $0.035. Of the Placement Warrants, warrants for 16,600,000 shares are exercisable through July 30, 2012, warrants for 11,666,666 are exercisable through November 1, 2012, warrants for 14,999,999 are exercisable through January 14, 2013, and warrants for 1,000,000 shares are exercisable through April 22, 2013. The exercise price for the Placement Agent Warrants is subject to adjustment if there are certain capital adjustments or similar transactions, such as a stock split or merger. Placement Agent Warrants for fifty percent of the shares contain provisions providing the holders thereof with the right to exercise the Warrants on a "cashless" basis after the first anniversary of issuance if the Re gistration Statement is not in effect at the time of exercise. If the holder elects the cashless exercise option, it will receive a lesser number of shares and we will not receive any cash proceeds from that exercise. The lesser number of shares which the holder will receive is determined by a formula that takes into account the closing bid price of our Common Stock on the trading day immediately before the Warrant exercise. That closing price is multiplied by the full number of shares for which the Warrant is then being exercised. That result is reduced by the total exercise price the holder would have paid for those shares if it had not elected a cashless exercise. The number of shares actually issued under the cashless exercise option is equal to the balance amount divided by the closing price referred to above. We are filing the Registration Statement so that we can receive cash proceeds upon any exercise of the Placement Warrants. The Placement Agent Warrants provide that the beneficial owner can exercise such warrant in accordance with their respective terms by giving notice to us. However, the holder may not exercise its Warrant to the extent that such exercise would result in such owner and its affiliates beneficially owning more than 4.99% of our stock then outstanding (after taking into account the shares of our Common Stock issuable upon such conversion or warrant exercise). If the holder then disposes of some or all of its holdings, it can again convert its debentures or exercise its warrant. DIVIDEND POLICY We have paid no dividends on our Common Stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. It is the present policy of our board of directors to retain all earnings to provide funds for the growth of the Company. The declaration and payment of dividends in the future will be determined by our board of directors based upon our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. We are not under any contractual restriction as to present or future ability to pay dividends. 9 MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Our Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol "ABTG". Although trading in our Common Stock has occurred on a relatively consistent basis, the volume of shares traded has been sporadic. Low High 2009 First Quarter $ 0.02 $ 0.101 Year Ended December 31, 2008 First Quarter $ 0.03 $ 0.045 Second Quarter $ 0.03 $ 0.06 Third Quarter $ 0.027 $ 0.036 Fourth Quarter $ 0.011 $ 0.03 Year Ended December 31, 2007 First Quarter $ 0.063 $ 0.10 Second Quarter $ 0.04 $ 0.068 Third Quarter $ 0.052 $ 0.07 Fourth Quarter $ 0.02 $ 0.05 As of May 29, 2009, there were 158 holders of record of our Common Stock. A significant number of shares of our Common Stock are held in either nominee name or street name brokerage accounts and, consequently, we are unable to determine the number of beneficial owners of our stock. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES RELATED TO THOSE STATEMENTS. SOME OF OUR DISCUSSION IS FORWARD-LOOKING AND INVOLVES RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING RISK FACTORS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, REFER TO THE RISK FACTORS SECTION OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. OVERVIEW Ambient is a pioneering integrator of smart grid communications platforms, creating high-speed Internet Protocols (IP) based data communications networks over existing medium and low-voltage distribution grids, thereby enabling smart grid applications. The Ambient smart grid platform, known as Ambient Smart Grid™, facilitates a two-way, real-time communications network to serve the “last mile” backhaul necessary for utilities to implement smart grid applications such as Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMI), real-time pricing, Demand Side Management (DSM), Distribution Monitoring and Automation, and direct load control and more. When combined, these applications can offer economic, operational and environmental benefits for utilities, and ultimately utility customers. We are currently conducting deployments with major electric utilities, developing, demonstrating, and delivering Ambient Smart Grid™ utility applications. We continue to develop and extend our network design expertise, our hardware and software technology, and our deployment and network management capabilities, with the goal of generating revenues from all phases of Ambient Smart Grid™ communications network deployments. In 2008, Ambient received purchase orders from a major US investor owned utility to purchase its X2000 and X-3000 communications nodes, license its AmbientNMS™, and acquire engineering support in building out an intelligent grid/intelligent-metering platform. These purchase orders have generated revenues of approximately $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $826,593 for the three months ended March 31, 2009. 10 We intend to actively seek new opportunities for commercial deployments and work to bring new and existing networks to full commercialization. In 2009, our principal target customers will continue to be electric utilities in North America that will be deploying smart grid technologies. We will work with our utility customers to drive the development of new utility and consumer applications that create the need for our Ambient Smart Grid™ platform. We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in June 1996. To date, we have funded operations primarily through the sale of our securities. In addition, we may need to raise funds in order to expand existing commercial deployments and otherwise grow our operations to meet the demands associated with any additional significant purchase order, or from any substantial expansion of existing commercial deployments. Ambient has played a principal role in driving industry standardization efforts through leadership roles in industry associations and standards setting organizations, and continues to expand strategic relationships with leading suppliers of critical smart grid technologies. Our goal is to be the leading designer, developer and systems integrator of turn-key Ambient Smart Grid ™ communications networks, incorporating a wide array of communications protocols and smart grid applications such as advanced metering solutions to complement our internally developed energy sensing capabilities. The Risk Factors starting on page 4 describe a number of risks that may impact our ability to achieve our goal. From inception through the third quarter of 2008, the Company was in the development stage and has had insignificant revenues. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 7 defines a development stage activity as one in which all efforts are devoted substantially to establishing a new business and even if planned principal operations have commenced, revenues are insignificant. In the fourth quarter of 2008, management determined that the Company was no longer in the development stage as the Company generated significant revenues. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARISON OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2009 TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2008 REVENUE. Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2009 were $826,593 compared to $63,642 for the corresponding period in 2008. Revenues for the 2009 period were attributable to the sales of equipment and software and related network design to Duke Energy. Revenue for the 2008 period were attributable to the sales of equipment. Revenues for the 2009 period and 2008 period related to the sales of equipment totaled $792,663 and $63,642. COST OF GOODS SOLD. Cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $731,236 compared to $342,870 during the corresponding period in 2008. Cost of goods sold included all costs related to manufacturing and selling products and services and consisted primarily of direct material costs. Cost of goods sold for the 2008 period included expenses related to the write down of inventory to the lower of cost or market. The increase in cost of goods sold during the 2009 Period reflects the increase in production to fill orders placed by Duke Energy. GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit for the 2009 period was $95,357 compared to a loss of $279,228 for the 2008 period. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. Research and development expenses consisted of expenses incurred primarily in designing, developing and field testing our smart grid solutions. These expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, contract design and testing services, supplies used and consulting and license fees paid to third parties. Research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2009 were $1,001,709 compared to $859,245 during the corresponding period in 2008. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses primarily consisted of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive and other administrative functions. Other significant costs included professional fees for legal, accounting and other services. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2009 were $1,073,294 compared to $745,557 for the corresponding 11 period in 2008. The increase in general and administrative expenses is due to the increase efforts to market and commercialize our Ambient Smart Grid™ communication platforms. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. A portion of our operating expenses were attributable to non-cash charges associated with the compensation of consultants and employees through the issuance of stock options and stock grants. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense and will therefore have no impact on our cash flows or liquidity. For the three months ended March 31, 2009, we incurred non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $222,674 compared to $114,868 for the corresponding period in 2008. INTEREST AND FINANCE EXPENSES. For the three months ended March 31, 2009, we incurred interest of $166,764 compared to $171,690 for the corresponding period in 2008. The interest related primarily to our Senior Secured 8% Convertible Debentures, which were issued in July 2007 through January 2008 and our 8% Convertible Debentures, which were issued in May 2006 and were retired in their entirety as of January 2, 2008. Additionally, for the 2009 Period and 2008 Period, we incurred non-cash interest of $1,697,529 and $358,607, respectively. This interest related to the amortization of the beneficial conversion features and deferred financing costs incurred in connection with the placement of our convertible debentures and notes. These costs are amortized to the date of maturity of the debt unless converted earlier. COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 (the 2008 Period) AND THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 (the 2007 Period) REVENUES. Revenues for the 2008 Period were $12,622,353, compared to $2,264,978, for the 2007 Period. Revenues during each of the periods were attributable to the sales of equipment, software and related network design and installation services from new pilots that were launched in 2008 and 2007. Revenues for the 2008 Period and 2007 period related to the sales of equipment totaled $12,136,283 and $2,179,076, respectively. Revenues from the sale of software and related network design and installation services for the 2008 Period and the 2007 Period totaled $486,070 and $85,902. Revenues for the 2008 and 2007 Periods included sales to Duke Energy of $12,622,353 and $2,237,378 respectively. COST OF GOODS SOLD. Cost of goods sold for the 2008 Period was $9,942,009 compared to $1,806,060 for the 2007 Period. Cost of goods sold included all costs related to manufacturing and selling products and services and consisted primarily of direct material costs. Cost of goods sold also included expenses related to the write down of inventory to the lower of cost or market. The increase in cost of goods sold during the 2008 Period reflects the increase in production to fill orders placed by Duke Energy. For the 2008 Period, cost of goods sold included an inventory reserve of $50,303 for excess, obsolete, and surplus inventory resulting from the transition from second to third generation technology. GROSS PROFIT. Gross profits for the 2008 Period was $2,680,344 compared to $458,918 for the 2007 Period. The gross profit on hardware sales amounted to $2,194,274 and $386,369 for the 2008 Period and 2007 Period, respectively. The increase in gross profits during the 2008 Period reflects the increase in revenues resulting from the production to fill orders placed by Duke Energy. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. Research and development expenses consisted of expenses incurred primarily in designing, developing and field testing our smart grid solutions. These expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, contract design and testing services, supplies used and consulting and license fees paid to third parties. Research and development expenses were approximately $4.2 million and $3.5 million for the 2008 Period and the 2007 Period, respectively. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive and other functions. Other significant costs included insurance and professional fees for legal, accounting and other services. General and administrative expenses for the 2008 Period were approximately $3.4 million compared to $3.8 million for the 2007 Period. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase over the next twelve months as we increase our efforts to market and commercialize our Smart Grid™ communication platforms. 12 OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. A portion of our operating expenses was attributable to non-cash charges associated with the compensation of employees and consultants through the issuance of stock options and stock grants. Stock-based compensation is non-cash and will therefore have no impact on our cash flows or liquidity. For the 2008 Period, we incurred non-cash stock based compensation expense of $329,320 compared to $343,711 for the 2007 Period. INTEREST AND FINANCE EXPENSES. For the 2008 Period and 2007 Period, interest expense totaled $3,155,815 and $8,791,072, respectively. Interest totaling $673,527 and $1,190,854 for the 2008 Period and 2007 Period respectively related primarily to our 8% Secured Convertible Promissory Notes, which were issued in July and November of 2007 and January 2008 and our 8% Convertible Debentures, which were issued in May 2006 and were retired in their entirety as of January 2, 2008. Additionally, for the 2008 Period and 2007 Period, we incurred non-cash interest of $2,482,288 and $7,600,218, respectively. This interest related to the amortization of the beneficial conversion features and deferred financing costs incurred in connection with the placement of our convertible debentures and notes. These costs are amortized to the date of maturity of the debt unless converted earlier. LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT. The Company accounted for the modification of the Convertible Promissory Notes as an extinguishment of debt. The Company deemed the terms of the amendment to be substantially different and treated the Convertible Promissory Notes as extinguished and exchanged for new notes. As such, it was necessary to reflect the Convertible Promissory Notes at fair market value and record a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $2.8 million. See Note 8 of the financial statements for a more detailed discussion. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash balances totaled $7,262,489 at March 31, 2009 and $8,011,764 at December 31, 2008. Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $856,247 and was used primarily to pay ongoing research and development and general and administrative expenses. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $109,734 during the three months ended March 31, 2009 and was for the redemption of marketable securities of $125,000, net of purchases of property and equipment of $15,726. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $2,762 during the three months ended March 31, 2009 and represents the payments on capitalized lease obligations. A discussion of our recent financings follows. In July 2007, November 2007 and January 2008, the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements with an institutional investor, Vicis Capital Master Fund ("Vicis"), and raised gross proceeds of $12.5 million. The notes (the Vicis Notes) issued under the Securities Purchase Agreements have a term of three years are payable between July 2010 and January 2011. The outstanding principal amounts of the notes were convertible at the option of Vicis into shares of Common Stock at an original conversion price of $0.035 per share, subject to certain adjustments. As discussed below, in November 2008, the conversion rate was reduced to the current rate of $0.015 per shares, subject to certain adjustments. On April 23, 2008, we raised from Vicis $3,000,000 from the issuance of warrants, exercisable through April 2013, to purchase up to 135,000,000 shares of our Common Stock at a per share exercise price of $0.001. On November 21, 2008, we and Vicis entered into a Debenture Amendment Agreement (the Debenture Amendment Agreement), pursuant to which Vicis invested in the Company an additional $8 million. In consideration of Vicis investment, we reduced the conversion price on the Vicis Notes from $0.035 per share to $0.015 per share. The parties also agreed under the Debenture Amendment Agreement that, in the event that on the trading day immediately preceding June 1, 2009, the closing per share price of our common stock is less than $0.10, then the per share conversion price with respect to any amount then outstanding under the Notes would automatically be further adjusted to $0.01. 13 Management believes that our current available cash resources, as well as anticipated revenues from proceeds, will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the balance of the 2009 fiscal year. However, we may need to raise funds in order to expand existing commercial deployments and/or satisfy any additional significant purchase order that we may receive. At the present time, we have no commitments for any additional funding that may be needed. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, investments, intangible assets and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. REVENUE RECOGNITION. Revenue is generated primarily from the sale of equipment as well as from the sales of software licenses and service and support. We recognize revenue from the sale of equipment upon shipment to customers and when all requirements related to the shipments have occurred. Revenue from the sale of software licenses represent a one-time fee for the use of the software and is recognized upon shipment to the customer. Revenue from service and support is recognized at the time the services are performed. Amounts billed to customers before equipment and/or software licenses are shipped or before services are performed are classified as deferred revenue. INVENTORY VALUATION . Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Market, with respect to direct materials, is replacement cost and is net realizable value for work-in-process and finished goods. The value of the inventory is adjusted for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS. Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed, requires the capitalization of certain software development costs incurred subsequent to the date technological feasibility is established and prior to the date the product is generally available for sale. The capitalized cost is then amortized straight-line over the estimated product life. The Company defines technological feasibility as being attained at the time our products and related software are available for deployment by our customers in defined pilots. All development activity and costs through December 2008 were incurred in order to ready the Ambient NMS and the in node software for deployment by customers. Significant deployment of the Companys products was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2008. To date, the p eriod between achieving technological feasibility and the general availability of such software has been short, and software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant. Accordingly, to date, the Company has not capitalized any software development costs. The Company will continue its research and development program into the future and continue to develop new products and software capabilities. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION . We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under SFAS No. 123(R), an entity is required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Equity instruments issued to non-employees are recorded at their fair values as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods and Services. 14 DEFERRED INCOME TAXES . Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of "temporary differences" by applying enacted statutory rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, our deferred income tax assets consisted primarily of net operating loss carry forwards and stock based compensation charges which have been fully offset with a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty that a tax benefit will be realized from the assets in the future. WARRANTIES AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS. The Company recognizes warranty and indemnification obligations under SFAS No. 5 (As Amended), "Accounting for Contingencies" ("SFAS 5"), FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" and FASB Concepts Statement ("SFAC") No. 7 (As Amended), "Using Cash Flow Information and Present Value in Accounting Measurements." These pronouncements require a guarantor to recognize and disclose a liability for obligations it has undertaken in relation to the issuance of the guarantee. The Company warrants that its products are free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of initial acceptance by our customers. The warranty does not cover any losses or damage that occurs as a result of improper installation, misuse or neglect and repair or modification by anyone other than the Company or its authorized repair agent. The Company's policy is to accrue anticipated warranty costs based upon historical percentages of items returned for repair within one year of the initial sale. The Companys repair rate of product under warranty has been minimal and a historical percentage has not been established. The Company has not provided for any reserves for such warranty liability. The Companys software license agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if the Company's software products infringe upon a third party's intellectual property rights. The Company has not provided for any reserves for such warranty liabilities. The Companys software license agreements also generally include a warranty that the Company's software products will substantially operate as described in the applicable program documentation. The Company also warrants that services the Company performs will be provided in a manner consistent with industry standards. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs associated with these product and service performance warranties, and as such the Company has not provided for any reserves for any such warranty liabilities in its operating results. FAIR VALUE . Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 (SFAS 157), Fair Value Measurements, for all financial instruments and non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. SFAS 157 establishes a new framework for measuring fair value and expands related disclosures. Broadly, the SFAS 157 framework requires fair value to be determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. SFAS 157 establishes market or observable inputs as the preferred source of values, followed by unobservable inputs or assumptions based on hypothetical transactions in the absence of market inputs. · Level 1, is defined as observable inputs being quoted prices in active markets for identical assets; · Level 2, is defined as observable inputs including quoted prices for similar assets; and · Level 3, is defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring assumptions based on the best information available. 15 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations (revised 2007)." SFAS No. 141(R) applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations established in SFAS No. 141 to all acquisitions where the acquirer gains a controlling interest, regardless of whether consideration was exchanged. Consistent with SFAS No. 141, SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquirer to fair value the assets and liabilities of the acquiree and record goodwill on bargain purchases, with main difference the application to all acquisitions where control is achieved. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 141(R) on January 1, 2009; however, the Company does not anticipate that the adoption will have a material impact on it s financial condition or results of its operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of ARB No. 51." SFAS No. 160 requires companies with noncontrolling interests to disclose such interests clearly as a portion of equity but separate from the parent's equity. The noncontrolling interest's portion of net income must also be clearly presented on the income statement. SFAS No. 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 160 as of January 1, 2009; however, it does not anticipate that the adoption will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of its operations. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157-2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157," which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 until January 1, 2009 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The Company believes the adoption of the delayed items of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on its financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS No. 162). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (commonly referred to as the GAAP hierarchy). The statement is effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 162 will have on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and disclosure s. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. This FSP provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. This FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. Upon adoption, a company is required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data (including any amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial data) to conform with the provisions in this FSP. Early application of this FSP is prohibited. We have not issued any share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Staff Position 157-2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157" ("FSP 157-2"). FSP 157-2 delayed the effective date of SFAS 157 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption of SFAS 157 to non-financial assets and liabilities did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 107-1 and Accounting Principles Board (APB) 28-1 "Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments". The FSP amends SFAS No. 107 "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments" to require an entity to provide disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial information. This FSP is to be applied prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009 with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. The Company will include the required disclosures in its quarter ending June 30, 2009. 16 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS OVERVIEW Ambient is a pioneering integrator of smart grid communications platforms, creating high-speed Internet Protocols (IP)-based data communications networks over existing medium and low-voltage distribution grids, thereby enabling smart grid applications. The Ambient smart grid platform, known as Ambient Smart Grid™, facilitates a two-way, real-time communications network to serve the “last mile” backhaul necessary for utilities to implement smart grid applications such as Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMI), real-time pricing, Demand Side Management (DSM), Distribution Monitoring and Automation, and direct load control and more. When combined, these applications can offer economic, operational and environmental benefits for utilities, and ultimately the utilitys customers. Dating back to 2000, Ambient has focused on developing communication platforms to enable utility applications throughout a utilitys distribution network. Over the past eight years, Ambient has evolved considerably to remain at the forefront of utility smart grid communication. In 2004, we upgraded our platform, from a 45 Mbps Design of Systems on Silicon (DS2) Broadband over Power Line (BPL) processor, to their second generation 200 Mbps chipset technology that had the potential for a more robust communications network. In 2005, with the integration of Wi-Fi wireless communications in our nodes, we leveraged the advantages of using multiple communications technologies under a single unified platform. In 2007, Ambient integrated both voltage sensing and current sensing capabilities into our products, allowing nodes to provide power quality data back to the utility in real-time, anywhere an enabled node is located. In December 2008, Ambient extended our communications capabilities to include cellular communications in our X2000 node, and subsequently received certification for our latest communication node, the X-3000, to backhaul through Verizon Wireless secure and ubiquitous network. Additionally, our network management system AmbientNMS™, introduced in 2005 was enhanced in 2008 to integrate geographic information systems (GIS) technology allowing for precise mapping and exact outage notification. In 2008, Ambient received purchase orders from Duke Energy to purchase its X2000 and X-3000 communications nodes, license its AmbientNMS™, and acquire engineering support in building out an intelligent grid/intelligent-metering platform, which generated $12.6 million in revenues in the year. As management believes that open standards and interoperability will hasten the deployment of all smart grid technology, Ambient has played a principal role in driving industry standardization efforts through leadership roles in industry associations and standards setting organizations and continues to expand strategic relationships with leading suppliers of critical smart grid technologies. Our goal is to be the leading designer, developer and systems integrator of a turnkey Ambient Smart Grid™ communications platform, incorporating a wide array of communications protocols and smart grid applications such as advanced metering solutions to complement our internally developed energy sensing capabilities. We view the smart grid communications platform to be a key factor for utilities to efficiently integrate increasing portfolios of renewable energy generation into the electrical grid. Ambient was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in June 1996, and to date, we have funded operations primarily through the sale of our securities. In connection with the continued development and upgrade, marketing, and deployment of our products, technology, and services, we anticipate that we will continue to augment our revenue generation capabilities with such capital raises in the future, and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses during the current fiscal year. 17 INDUSTRY BACKGROUND THE UTILITYS DILEMMA The existing electrical power distribution system is analog and is under increasing pressure to catch up to the digital economy which it serves. Dedicated sensors and communications infrastructures are necessary components needed to monitor and manage the distribution grid, allowing for the improvement of system wide efficiency and security. For several decades, utilities have used their distribution networks to carry low-speed data for simple monitoring and control functions. Ambient has built upon this model by combining multiple high-speed Internet Protocol (IP)-based communications technologies to facilitate the needed migration to the next generation digital distribution grid, and to solve some of the problems that electric utilities and their customers face. Electric utilities are under increasing economic, regulatory, environmental and societal pressure to deploy open standard based smart grid technologies to more efficiently serve their customers and the public at large. Much of the aged infrastructure of the electrical distribution grid in the United States is nearing the end of its useful life span and needs to be better managed and eventually replaced. The system is based on decades old technology that requires customers to notify the utility of power outages, costly truck rolls to read electrical meters, and inefficient load profiles of electrical consumption. Additionally, energy demand is increasing at double the rate of population growth, pressuring utilities to build new generating capacity to serve peak demand, with no improvement in load factors. Delivering the electrical power generated today by a more efficient methodology reduces the need to build out this new generation capacity, which is growing increasingly more expensive to build, and is unattractive from an environmental perspective. Moving forward in the 21 st century, utilities, federal and state governments and regulatory bodies attach a growing importance to increasing operational efficiencies and modernizing the distribution grid as key components in addressing the issues raised above. The Ambient Smart Grid™ communications platform facilitates desired utility solutions that increase operational efficiency and improve security, by providing the ability to monitor and control equipment, remotely read meters, and enable customers to make real-time price based usage decisions. AMBIENT SOLUTION THE AMBIENT SMART GRID™ COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK The Ambient Smart Grid™ communications solution is a modular network overlaid on the medium-voltage and low-voltage segments of the power distribution system allowing real-time insight into the operations of the electrical distribution grid while supporting any IP-based application. High-speed backhaul connections (which go to the Internet or to private networks) connect the Ambient Smart Grid™ network at any point along the medium voltage circuit allowing for data traffic to be carried, via an array of technologies including cellular, Wi-Fi, RF, and/or low bit rate power line carrier (PLC). Historically, no single solution or technology has existed which could provide the necessary flexibility needed for a cost-effective capability to provide a digital, open standards-based communications network. Ambient Smart Grid™ communications platform was developed specifically to fill this void and meet the utility’s need to integrate various technologies within the Ambient platform. The Ambient Smart Grid™ communications platform is comprised of nodes that are configured to act as individual data processors, and collectors that receive and transmit the communications signal from other networked devices including other nodes, couplers or end-user devices. Ambient's node can directly interface with any device with a serial or Ethernet port, and can deliver high-speed communications data using existing and developing technologies. Our nodes are modular devices that can be configured for different roles within the network. Nodes can repeat (regenerate) the signal, and accept backhaul connections (cellular data, fiber, Ethernet, etc) or various end-user connections. Within the Ambient communications platform, each node is individually addressed and can be remotely accessed to detect system status (such as power and low battery conditions) and perform other management related functions. Ambients nodes are built for use in the outdoor electrical distribution grid and meet the necessary certifications. 18 To manage the large numbers of nodes, devices, and customers on a smart grid network, Ambient has developed a network management system, trademarked as AmbientNMS™. AmbientNMS™ has an easy to use, browser-based interface and supports auto-discovery of network resources, virtual local area networks (VLANs) , provisioning, multiple networks, event logging, data collection, alerts, reporting, and multiple levels of users and security. AmbientNMS™ continues to be enhanced with additional features and functionality, such as the recent integration of geographic information systems (GIS) technology. We address data security and data integrity concerns at all levels of the system. Safety and compliance with regulatory requirements are top priorities throughout the design, development, manufacture and deployment of all of our equipment. Our nodes are tested and certified as complying with applicable United States and Canadian safety standards for information technology equipment. Our overhead couplers are tested to American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards for electrical power insulators and are designed, where applicable, for safe non-contact installation with either hot sticks or rubber gloves. AMBIENT SMART GRID™ COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORM FUNCTIONALITY AND BENEFITS Complete turnkey delivery : Ambient designs and builds the core network hardware and management software incorporating the leading smart grid communication technologies. Our familiarity with multiple communications protocols, architecture, hardware, and software requirements, coupled with experienced field engineers, provides us with the tools necessary for a successful rollout. Flexible and expandable network architecture : An Ambient Smart Grid™ communications platform permits sequential expansions corresponding to actual demand. When the platform is first deployed, separate network elements can be “bridged” at specific points. As the network load increases, switches and/or routers can maximize the bandwidth available to a particular network segment. At higher subscriber densities, additional backhaul connectivity points may be added. By allowing utilities to build networks that provide just the capacity that is needed, as it is needed, we help our customers minimize initial installation costs, shorten the time between investment and realization of revenues, and reduce operations and maintenance expenses. Outage detection and restoration confirmation : Rather than dedicated outage detection systems that employ either customer premise or service side equipment, the node is powered from the low voltage line itself and can be equipped with an optional battery which can help a utility specifically identify line outages and allow for continued node operation in the event of such a power outage. Access to the nodes in an outage scenario allows timely recognition of outage locations and provides invaluable input to the restoration process. Support External Applications : A high-speed Ambient Smart Grid™ enhances traditional low bandwidth, one-way applications such as meter reading. In addition to the elimination of the labor required to visit every customer location each month, or the inaccuracies introduced by customer self-reporting, the constant real-time load data can enhance a utility's ability to balance its supply portfolio, improve its load profiling, and increase its knowledge of customer usage patterns. Meters that remotely turn service on or off can be deployed, eliminating the labor involved in this non-repair, non-revenue task. Additionally, real-time communications enabled by Ambients high-speed backhaul network allow utilities the flexibility to introduce time-of-use pricing models. Utility operators are not limited to Advanced Meter Reading (AMR) and other applications at the end of the distribution grid : An Ambient Smart Grid™ platform transforms the distribution grid itself into a series of data points. Grid operators can monitor and communicate with nodes or IP-based equipment integrated at any point along the Ambient Smart Grid™ distribution network, which can range from distributed generation resources, power quality control devices, and a range of Demand Side Management and Demand Response applications. When couplers are integrated into an Ambient Smart Grid™ communications network information on the current of the distribution grid can be obtained in real-time enabling better energy management, predictive maintenance and less system down-time which can combine to reduce the need for additional generation facilities. 19 AMBIENT STRATEGY We intend to generate revenues from the design, sales, installation, and support of the necessary equipment and technologies, of the Ambient Smart Grid™ communications platform, and from licensing of our network management system, AmbientNMS™. Our efforts are presently focused on attaining the following goals: BUSINESS DEVELPOMENT Ambient believes the industry will be driven by a few key early adopters (marquee customers) who will set the stage for additional North American smart grid deployments. Ambient has and will continue to work closely with utility partners to develop an increasing value proposition for each utilitys unique needs and infrastructure. Ambient will focus engineering efforts on developing more robust solutions and additional value-added functionality for the Ambient Smart Grid™ solution, creating an even more attractive business model for other utilities. Additionally, Ambient has recently entered into a joint marketing agreement with Verizon Wireless that will afford us the opportunity to expand our efforts to introduce the Ambient Smart Grid™ platform to other select utilities in the Unites States. EXPAND THE RANGE OF AMBIENT SMART GRID™ APPLICATIONS: Applications create the need for the platform, and thus our goal is to drive application development. While the Ambient Smart Grid™ communications platform incorporates our voltage and current sensing capabilities and outage notification, we believe that growth in the smart grid communications industry will come primarily as utilities deploy and adopt smart grid applications. Applications, such as AMR/AMI allowing for time-of-use pricing, demand side management, and direct load control, which enables the reduction of electrical usage at critical times, will require the backhaul capability provided by the Ambient Smart Grid™ network. Ambient is currently piloting and deploying some of the aforementioned applications. PURSUE OUR ROLE AS A PIONEERING SYSTEMS INTEGRATOR: We are committed to continuing our role as a supplier of turnkey smart grid communications platforms, taking responsibility for network design, hardware and software delivery, installation support, operator training and network management.

Ambient is a founding member of the Universal Powerline Association (UPA), an association of industry players created to promote BPL global interoperability standards. We are also a member of the United Power Line Council (UPLC), an alliance of electric utilities and technology companies working together to drive standards development. Ram Rao, our Chief Technology Officer, is co-chair of the UPLC Technical Action Committee. Ambient is also a member of the GridWise Alliance, a consortium of public and private stakeholders who are aligned around the vision of a transformed electric system, and in 2008 joined the Dem and Response and Smart Grid (DRSG) Coalition. Ambient is actively participating in several ongoing standardization efforts to drive the development of safety, electromagnetic compatibility and system interoperability standards. Key Ambient technical personnel currently chair or participate in the following Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) working groups: PLC Hardware Safety Working Subgroup (P1675), PLC EMC Working Group (P1775) and BPL PHY/MAC Working Group (P1901). DEPLOYMENTS We are currently deploying the Ambient Smart Grid™ with major electric utilities in North America. Deployments are directed towards a variety of goals including, developing, integrating, and demonstrating smart grid utility applications within our product offering. DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION (Duke Energy) Duke Energy is a pioneer in smart grid deployments with their Utility of the Future initiative. In 2005, Ambient entered into a pilot agreement to test the Ambient Smart Grid™ solution. After completion of a proof of concept phase, in January 2006, we entered into a pilot demonstration agreement to build a BPL network servicing approximately 500 homes. The pilot network was an important test for our newly developed AmbientNMS™. In September 2006, we entered into a Commercial Deployment Agreement expanding the scope and functionality of the BPL network. During 2007, Ambient focused on the execution of the Agreement entered into in September 2006 that expanded the scope of Ambient's platform while addressing the challenges raised in our early 2006 BPL pilot. In late 2007, Ambient introduced cellular technology into our platform, diminishing the platform's dependency on BPL. Throughout 2008, Ambient furthered its relationship with Duke Energy with the execution of a second Commercial Deployment Agreement to serve, initially, 50,000 end points. The Company received purchase orders from Duke Energy to purchase its X2000 and X-3000 communications nodes, license of its AmbientNMS™, software, and to provide engineering support in building out an intelligent grid/intelligent-metering platform. As a result of these purchase orders, we have generated approximately $12.6 million in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. CONSOLIDATED EDISON COMPANY OF NEW YORK (Con Edison): In 2002, Con Edison of New York began a feasibility trial of BPL technology located in Westchester N.Y. In 2004, Ambient and Con Edison began conducting phased development trials of utility service and management applications. In January 2006, Ambient and Con Edison successfully completed the Small Field Trial Phase, and entered into an agreement with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to move forward to an Advanced Grid Management Pilot Phase. NYSERDA is a public benefit corporation that funds research into energy supply and efficiency, and provided partial funding for the project through a $200,000 grant to Con Edison. During the second quarter of 2007 this deployment was upgraded to a higher speed network, which included the functionality to monitor current and voltage with the latest version of AmbientNMS™. 21 Ambient’s deployment in Westchester County is to date our most substantial deployment with Con Edison and has been used as a test bed to develop and test alternative communications capabilities for Ambients hybrid communications network. Some of our initial test projects undertaken are still in operation. These projects include substation monitoring at Orange & Rockland, a wholly owned subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, a Multiple Dwelling Unit (MDU) in Manhattan with 216 apartments and VoIP communications in Con Edison's First Avenue steam tunnel in Manhattan, New York. OTHER UTILITY PROJECTS: In 2006, we entered into deployment agreements with two additional utility customers. The ensuing deployments, which are conducted in Akron, Ohio and Little Rock, Arkansas, respectively, are both small pilots that are ongoing. KEY ALLIANCES / PRODUCTION & SUPPLIES In addition to working closely with our electric utility customers, we have cultivated, maintained and grown collaborative working relationships with leading suppliers of the critical components necessary for Ambient Smart Grid™ solutions. These relationships along with the advancements of our technology have provided us with the means of significant scalability. In 2007, we initiated collaborative efforts, which continued throughout 2008, with a pioneer in control networks which connect machines and other electronic devices that can monitor and save energy, lower costs. Ambient looks to further such collaborative efforts to enhance our smart grid capabilities. Ambients communications platform facilitates the delivery of data and information over the utility distribution grid from low-speed control networks and other devices allowing utilities the ability to enable such smart grid functionality as advanced metering, load profiles, remote disconnect/reconnect and more. We believe that an enhanced utility automation suite of products is complementary to Ambients communications platform, and together such collaborative efforts will enable comprehensive offerings to utilities enabling a more efficient platform for Ambient Smart Grid™ applications. We have an agreement in place with an original equipment manufacturer for the supply of our communication nodes. This agreement contains automatic renewal terms, unless earlier terminated. We are also a party to a number of third party software license agreements that allow us to incorporate third party software products and features into our software. Ambient is continuously in contact with leaders in utility and communications services to keep Ambients solution at the cutting edge. Moving forward, we intend to continue leveraging our technology and distribution alliances along with value-added manufacturing services to ensure we are positioned to support continued large-scale rollouts of our products and technology, allowing us to ensure competitive pricing. COMPETITION Competition in our market involves rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, and changes in customer requirements. To maintain and improve our competitive position, we must keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers and continue to develop and introduce new products, features and services in a timely and efficient manner. Our competitors include both small companies as well as some of the largest companies in the electronics industry, operating either alone or together with trade associations and partners. Some of our potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than our Company. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS We have taken steps to ensure the protection of our internally developed intellectual property (IP). We currently rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law, as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements, to protect our technologies and other proprietary company information. 22 Our policy is to require our employees, consultants, advisors, and collaborators to execute confidentiality agreements, and additionally, with employees and consultants, assignment of invention agreements, upon the commencement of employment, consulting or advisory relationships. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known to a party by us during the course of the party's association with the Company is to be kept confidential and not to be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and consultants, the agreements also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of their employment or consulting relationship will be our exclusive property. EMPLOYEES We presently employ 39 full time employees, 37 of whom work out of our offices in Newton, Massachusetts. Two off site employees are field engineers dedicated to active network deployments. ADVISORY BOARD Ambients Advisory Board, chaired by former senator J. Bennett Johnston, who served on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee his entire 24 years in the Senate, provides us with advice from a diverse group of experienced, knowledgeable business people and professionals. Our advisory board members spend much of their time in related and complementary business arenas, such as government policy, international relations, utility engineering, and law. They use their unique experiences, information, and perspectives to advise management in areas in which we may require assistance. Although our advisory board has no control or direct influence over our policies, management, or board of directors, they are from time-to-time a source of analysis, advice, recommendations, and support. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS CAPITALIZE ON EMERGING LEGISLATION The need for smart grid technologies and capabilities has been endorsed by the federal government with the passing of the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, which included a smart grid provision allocating federal funds to smart grid projects, and mandating all utilities look at smart grid alternatives prior to building additional generation capacity. The provisions of this act were strengthened by the passing of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed in February 2009 which is intended to inject billions of dollars into the development and deployments of smart grid technologies. It is our intention to pursue opportunities created by federal and state legislation to promote smart grid technologies. Domestic and foreign regulations directly and indirectly affect the deployment of smart grid communications networks. Our utility customers and other providers of electric power are subject to significant governmental oversight and regulation, on both the state and federal level. Foreign utilities and other providers of electric power are also subject to significant governmental oversight and regulation in their respective home countries. Domestic and foreign regulations in the telecommunications field may affect portions of our deployments. Any of these regulations may inhibit, delay or preclude network deployments or require significant and limiting modifications to them. We are proactively addressing these regulatory challenges through participation in industry associations such as the Universal Powerline Association and the United Power Line Council, and standards setting organizations such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics E ngineers. Further regulatory changes will certainly take places in the coming months and years. Through our participation in industry advocacy and standards groups, Ambient expects to be instrumental in driving this process forward and in benefiting from the results.

The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of stock option granted under FAS 123R, were: (A) for 2007: expected holding period of 3.25 years, risk free interest rate of 4.69, no dividend yield and volatility of 110.42%; and (B) for 2006; expected holding period of 5.75 years, risk free interest rate of 3.67, no dividend yield and volatility of 127.40% for 2007. No Options were issued to directors during 2008. (2) Heads the Audit Committee 27 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS We retain the law firm of Shipman & Goodwin LLP ("S&G"), of which Mr. Michael Widland, a non-employee director, is a partner, to perform legal services from time to time. We paid S&G $117,316 and $93,118 for legal services rendered during 2008 and 2007, respectively. Mr. Shad Stastney, a director is the founding partner of Vicis Capital Master Fund, which holds convertible promissory notes (the Notes) in the aggregate principal amount of $12.5 million which are currently potentially convertible into 833,333,333 shares of our Common Stock. The Notes contain a contractual restriction on beneficial share ownership that limits Vicis to holding 4.99% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock except upon providing us with not less than 61 days prior notice. The Notes and Warrants are held directly by Vicis Capital Master Fund, for which Vicis Capital LLC acts as investment advisor. Vicis Capital LLC may be deemed to beneficially own any shares held upon conversion of the Note and exercise of the Warrants within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by virtue of the voting and dispositive power over such shares granted by Vicis Capital Maste r Fund to Vicis Capital LLC. The voting and dispositive power granted to Vicis Capital LLC by Vicis Capital Master Fund may be revoked at any time. Vicis Capital LLC disclaims beneficial ownership of any shares reported herein. If Vicis were to give notice and subsequently convert the Notes then it would own, assuming such conversion and exercise were to take place on June 1, 2009, approximately 84% of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock and 75% of our shares on a fully diluted basis. DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE As the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, director John Joyce is not considered independent based on the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market if the securities of the Company were so listed (which they are not). The Board of Directors of the Company has concluded that each other director is independent based on such listing standards, having concluded that any relationship between such director and the Company, in its opinion, does not interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Board of Directors of the Company has also concluded that the directors serving on the audit committee, namely Mr. Pierce and Mr. Higgins are independent based on the more stringent independence standard of the NASDAQ Stock Market applicable to directors serving on audit committees. BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT, DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN BENEFICIAL HOLDERS The following table sets forth certain information, as of June 1, 2009, concerning the ownership of the Common Stock by (a) each person who, to the Company's knowledge, beneficially owned on that date more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock, (b) each of the Company's directors and the Named Executive Officers (as defined below) and (c) all current directors and executive officers of the Company as a group.

All securities are held directly by Vicis Capital Master Fund, for which Vicis Capital LLC acts as investment advisor. Vicis Capital LLC may be deemed to beneficially own any shares held upon conversion of the notes and exercise of the Warrants within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by virtue of the voting and dispositive power ov er such shares granted by Vicis Capital Master Fund to Vicis Capital LLC. The voting and dispositive power granted to Vicis Capital LLC by Vicis Capital Master Fund may be revoked at any time. Vicis Capital LLC disclaims beneficial ownership of any shares reported herein. Shad Stastney, a founder and principal of Vicis Capital LLC, together with John Succo and Sky Lucas, have voting and dispositive control of these securities. No single natural person can exercise voting or investment power with respect to the securities owed by Vicis Capital Master Fund and investment decisions with respect to these securities are made by a majority of these persons. (9) See Footnotes 3 through 7. 29 SELLING STOCKHOLDERS Up to 43,633,331 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants are being offered under this Prospectus, all of which are being registered for sale for the account of the selling stockholders. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with SEC rules and includes voting or investment power with respect to the securities. However, no selling stockholder may exercise its warrants if such exercise would cause such holder's beneficial ownership of our Common Stock (excluding shares underlying any of their unexercised warrants) to exceed 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately after the exercise. (If the holder subsequently disposes of some or all of its holdings, it can again exercise its warrant, subject to the same limitation). The table below also includes the number of shares which might be issuable on the occurrence of certain events, such as the accrual of dividends, which have not yet occurred and may not occur. Therefore, although they are included in the table below, the number of shares of Common Stock for some listed persons may include shares that are not subject to purchase during the 60-day perio d. SELLING STOCKHOLDERS TABLE The following table sets forth the shares beneficially owned, as of June 1, 2009, by the selling stockholders (as represented to us by the selling stockholders) prior to the offering contemplated by this Prospectus, the number of shares each selling stockholder is offering by this Prospectus and the number of shares which each would own beneficially if all such offered shares are sold. The selling stockholders acquired their beneficial interests in the shares being offered hereby in the private placement described above under the caption "AGREEMENTS WITH THE SELLING STOCKHOLDERS" in which each such selling stockholder advised us that it purchased the relevant securities solely for investment and not with a view to or for resale or distribution of such securities.

These sales may be at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. The selling stockholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares: · directly as principals; · ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers; · block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; · purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account; · an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange; · privately negotiated transactions; · to cover short sales made in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; · broker-dealers may agree with the selling stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share; · a combination of any such methods of sale; and · any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. The selling stockholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Act if available, rather than under this Prospectus. Broker-dealers engaged by the selling stockholders may arrange for other broker-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as an agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated. The selling stockholders do not expect these commissions and discounts to exceed what is customary in the types of transactions involved. We are not aware of any definitive selling arrangement at the date of this prospectus between any selling stockholder and any broker-dealer or agent. Upon our being notified by a selling stockholder that any material arrangement has been entered into with a broker-dealer for the sale of shares through a block trade, special offering, exchange distribution or secondary distribution or a purchase by a broker or dealer, a supplement to this prospectus will be filed by us, if required, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, disclosing: · The name of each such selling stockholder and of the participating broker-dealer(s); · The number of shares involved; · The price at which such shares were sold; · The commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealer(s), where applicable; · That such broker-dealer(s) did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus; and · Other facts material to the transaction. 31 The selling stockholders may from time to time pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the shares owned by them and, if they default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell shares from time to time under this Prospectus, or under an amendment to this Prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the Act amending the list of selling stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling stockholders under this Prospectus. The selling stockholders may also transfer the shares in other circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this Prospectus. The selling stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be "underwriters" within the meaning of the Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Act. Discounts, concessions, commissions and similar selling expenses, if any, that can be attributed to the sale of securities will be paid by the applicable selling stockholder and/or the purchasers. If a selling stockholder uses this Prospectus for any sale of the shares, it will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Act. The selling stockholders will be responsible to comply with the applicable provisions of the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including, without limitation, Regulation M, as applicable to such selling stockholders in connection with resales of their respective shares under this Registration Statement. We are required to pay all fees and expenses incident to the registration of the shares being offered by the selling stockholders, but we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares except for, upon exercise, the exercise price of options and warrants exercised on a cash basis. We have agreed to indemnify certain selling stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Act. DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK We are authorized to issue 2,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $.001 par value per share, of which 721,684,187 shares were outstanding as of May 29, 2009. We have approximately 158 stockholders of record as of such date. A significant portion of our Common Stock is held in either nominee name or street name brokerage accounts and, consequently, we are not able to determine the beneficial owners of our Common Stock. Holders of shares of our Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. Holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors from funds legally available therefore and to share ratably in our assets available upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. The holders of shares of the Common Stock do not have cumulative voting rights for the election of d irectors and, accordingly, the holders of more than 50% of the shares of Common Stock are able to elect all directors. DISCLOSURE OF SEC POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, our officers and directors are indemnified by us to the fullest extent allowed under Delaware law for claims brought against them in their capacities as officers and directors. Indemnification is not allowed if the officer or director does not act in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in our best interest, or if the officer or director had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was lawful. Accordingly, indemnification may occur for liabilities arising under the Act. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Act may be permitted for our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2009 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2009. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company has sustained losses since its inception. These losses have produced operating cash flow deficiencies. The Company expects to incur additional losses in the future and may need to raise additional funds in order to realize its long-range commercial objectives. Management believes that our current available cash resources, as well as anticipated revenues from proceeds, will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the balance of the 2009 fiscal year. However, we may need to raise funds in order to expand existing commercial deployments and/or satisfy any additional significant purchase order that we may receive. At the present time, we have no commitments for any additional funding that may be needed. NOTE 2 - RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Staff Position 157-2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157" ("FSP 157-2"). FSP 157-2 delayed the effective date of SFAS 157 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption of SFAS 157 to non-financial assets and liabilities did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 107-1 and Accounting Principles Board (APB) 28-1 "Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments". The FSP amends SFAS No. 107 "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments" to require an entity to provide disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial information. This FSP is to be applied prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009 with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. The Company will include the required disclosures in its quarter ending June 30, 2009. NOTE 3 - NET LOSS PER SHARE Basic earnings (loss) per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share adjusts basic earnings (loss) per share for the effects of convertible securities, stock options and other potentially dilutive instruments, only in the periods in which such effect is dilutive. The following securities have been excluded from the calculation of net loss per share, as their effect would be antidilutive.

F-15 AMBIENT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Ambient Corporation ("Ambient or the "Company") is incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in June 1996. Ambient is a pioneering integrator of smart grid communications platforms, creating high-speed Internet Protocols (IP) based data communications networks over existing medium and low-voltage distribution grids, thereby enabling smart grid applications. The Ambient smart grid platform, known as Ambient Smart Grid™, facilitates a two-way, real-time communications network to serve the “last mile” backhaul necessary for utilities to implement smart grid applications such as Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMI), real-time pricing, Demand Side Management (DSM), Distribution Monitoring and Automation, and direct load control and more. When combined, these applications can offer economic, operational and environmental benefits for utilities, and ultimately utility customers. We are currently conducting pilot demonstrations and deployments with major electric utilities, developing, demonstrating, and delivering Ambient Smart Grid™ utility applications. We continue to develop and extend our network design expertise, our hardware and software technology, and our deployment and network management capabilities, with the goal of generating revenues from all phases of Ambient Smart Grid™ communications network deployments. In 2008, Ambient received purchase orders from Duke Energy to purchase its X2000 and X-3000 communications nodes, licensing of its AmbientNMS™, and engineering support in building out an intelligent grid/intelligent-metering platform. These purchase orders have resulted in recorded revenues of approximately $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. We intend to actively seek new opportunities for commercial deployments and work to bring new and existing networks to full commercialization. In 2009, our principal target customers will continue to be electric utilities in North America that will be deploying the smart grid technologies. We will work with our other technology companies and utility customers to drive the development of new utility and consumer applications that create the need for our Ambient Smart Grid™ platform. To date, we have funded operations primarily through the sale of our securities. In connection with the continued development and upgrade, marketing, and deployment of our products, technology, and services, we anticipate that we will continue to augment our revenue generation capabilities with such capital raises in the future, and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses during the current fiscal year. NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Company has sustained losses since its inception. These losses have produced operating cash flow deficiencies, and negative working capital. The Company expects to incur additional losses in the future and may need to raise additional funds in order to realize its long-range commercial objectives. Management believes that our current available cash resources, as well as anticipated revenues from proceeds, will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the balance of the 2009 fiscal year. However, we may need to raise funds in order to expand existing commercial deployments and/or satisfy any additional significant purchase order that we may receive. At the present time, we have no commitments for any additional funding that may be needed. During 2008, the Company funded its operating cash flow deficit with the proceeds from the private placement of its securities to an institutional investor. The Company raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $13.5 million in three separate transactions. See Notes 8 and 10 below. NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its inactive, wholly-owned subsidiary, Insulated Connections Corporation Limited. The subsidiary has been inactive since 2001. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. F-16 DEVELOPMENT STAGE From inception through the third quarter of 2008, the Company was in the development stage and has had insignificant revenues. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 7 defines a development stage activity as one in which all efforts are devoted substantially to establishing a new business and even if planned principal operations have commenced, revenues are insignificant. In the fourth quarter of 2008, management determined that the Company was no longer in the development stage as the Company generated significant revenues. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates. CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original maturities of 90 days or less. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates market value. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Substantially all of the Company's financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, other current liabilities and convertible debentures, are carried at, or approximate, fair value because of their short-term nature or because they carry market rates of interest. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under SFAS No. 123(R), an entity is required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Equity instruments issued to non-employees are recorded at their fair values as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods and Services. NET LOSS PER SHARE Basic earnings (loss) per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share adjusts basic earnings (loss) per share for the effects of convertible securities, stock options and other potentially dilutive instruments, only in the periods in which such effect is dilutive. The following securities have been excluded from the calculation of net loss per share, as their effect would be anti-dilutive. 2008 2007 Stock options 32,387,000 32,307,000 Warrants 129,216,664 346,624,999 Convertible debentures 833,333,333 222,912,222 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Equipment, furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from one to five years. F-17 REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is generated primarily from the sale of equipment as well as from the sales of software licenses and service and support. We recognize revenue from the sale of equipment upon shipment to customers and when all requirements related to the shipments have occurred. Revenue from the sale of software licenses represent a one-time fee for the use of the software and are recognized upon shipment to the customer. Revenue from service and support is recognized at the time the services are performed. Amounts billed to customers before equipment and/or software licenses are shipped or before services are performed are classified as deferred revenue. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon management's analysis of the collectability of the balances. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, management believed that no allowance was necessary. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, one customer accounted for approximately 100% and 99% of accounts receivable. See Note 11. INVENTORY Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Market, with respect to direct materials, is replacement cost and is net realizable value for work-in-process and finished goods. The value of the inventory is adjusted for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND PATENT COSTS Both research and development costs and patent costs are charged to operations as incurred. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed, requires the capitalization of certain software development costs incurred subsequent to the date technological feasibility is established and prior to the date the product is generally available for sale. The capitalized cost is then amortized straight-line over the estimated product life. The Company defines technological feasibility as being attained at the time our products and related software are available for deployment by our customers in defined pilots. All development activity and costs through December 2008 were incurred in order to ready the Ambient NMS and the in node software for deployment by customers. Significant deployment of the Companys products was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2008. To date, the period between achieving technological feasibility and the general availability of such software has bee n short, and software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant. Accordingly, to date, the Company has not capitalized any software development costs. The Company will continue its research and development program into the future and continue to develop new products and software capabilities. DEFERRED FINANCE COSTS Deferred finance costs consist of costs incurred by the Company relating to the issuance of convertible debentures. Deferred finance costs are being amortized to the date of maturity of the debentures unless converted earlier. PREPAID LICENSING FEES Effective January 31, 2004, the Company entered into a five-year licensing agreement with Design of Systems on Silicon ("DS2"), a supplier of components of the Company's power line communications technology, pursuant to which DS2 has granted Ambient a license of the DS2 power line related technology on a world wide nonexclusive basis. The license fee was amortized over the five year term on a straight-line basis. Amortization was $79,200 per year for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. F-18 INCOME TAXES The Company uses the liability method to determine its income tax. This method requires the establishment of a deferred tax asset or liability for the recognition of future deductible or taxable amounts and operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense or benefit is recognized as a result of the changes in the assets and liabilities during the year. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce a deferred tax asset, if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of it will not be realized. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 ( FIN 48 ) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109) which became effective in 2007. This interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in the amount of income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provisions of FIN 48 were adopted by the Company on January 1, 2007 and had no effect on the Co mpany's financial statements upon adoption. The Company also evaluated its tax positions as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 and reached the same conclusion. WARRANTIES AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS The Company recognizes warranty and indemnification obligations under SFAS No. 5 (As Amended), "Accounting for Contingencies" ("SFAS 5"), FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" and FASB Concepts Statement ("SFAC") No. 7 (As Amended), "Using Cash Flow Information and Present Value in Accounting Measurements." These pronouncements require a guarantor to recognize and disclose a liability for obligations it has undertaken in relation to the issuance of the guarantee. The Company warrants that its products are free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of initial acceptance by our customers. The warranty does not cover any losses or damage that occurs as a result of improper installation, misuse or neglect and repair or modification by anyone other than the Company or its authorized repair agent. The Company's policy is to accrue anticipated warranty costs based upon historical percentages of items returned for repair within one year of the initial sale. The Companys repair rate of product under warranty has been minimal, and a historical percentage has not been established. The Company has not provided for any reserves for such warranty liability. The Companys software license agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if the Company's software products infringe upon a third party's intellectual property rights. The Company has not provided for any reserves for such warranty liabilities. The Companys software license agreements also generally include a warranty that the Company's software products will substantially operate as described in the applicable program documentation. The Company also warrants that services the Company performs will be provided in a manner consistent with industry standards. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs associated with these product and service performance warranties, and as such the Company has not provided for any reserves for any such warranty liabilities in its operating results. CONCENTRATIONS Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with major financial institutions in the United States. Deposits held with these banks at times exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit or institutional risk on cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, amounts in excess of insurance amounted to approximately $-0- and $352,000 respectively. F-19 IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144 "Accounting for Impairment of Disposal of Long-lived Assets." The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. Impairment losses are recorded for the excess, if any, of the carrying value over the fair value of the long-lived assets. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 (SFAS 157), Fair Value Measurements, for all financial instruments and non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. SFAS 157 establishes a new framework for measuring fair value and expands related disclosures. Broadly, the SFAS 157 framework requires fair value to be determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. SFAS 157 establishes market or observable inputs as the preferred source of values, followed by unobservable inputs or assumptions based on hypothetical transactions in the absence of market inputs. · Level 1, is defined as observable inputs being quoted prices in active markets for identical assets; · Level 2, is defined as observable inputs including quoted prices for similar assets; and · Level 3, is defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring assumptions based on the best information available. The Companys marketable securities at December 31, 2008 consisted of investments in auction rate securities. Those securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in an active market. The auction rate securities were redeemed in full in January 2009. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations (revised 2007)." SFAS No. 141(R) applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations established in SFAS No. 141 to all acquisitions where the acquirer gains a controlling interest, regardless of whether consideration was exchanged. Consistent with SFAS No. 141, SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquirer to fair value the assets and liabilities of the acquiree and record goodwill on bargain purchases, with main difference the application to all acquisitions where control is achieved. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 141(R) on January 1, 2009; however, the Company does not anticipate that the adoption will have a material impact on it s financial condition or results of its operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of ARB No. 51." SFAS No. 160 requires companies with noncontrolling interests to disclose such interests clearly as a portion of equity but separate from the parent's equity. The noncontrolling interest's portion of net income must also be clearly presented on the income statement. SFAS No. 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 160 as of January 1, 2009; however, it does not anticipate that the adoption will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of its operations. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157-2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157," which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 until January 1, 2009 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The Company believes the adoption of the delayed items of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on its financial statements. F-20 In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS No. 162). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (commonly referred to as the GAAP hierarchy). The statement is effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 162 will have on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and disclosu res. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. This FSP provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. This FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. Upon adoption, a company is required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data (including any amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial data) to conform with the provisions in this FSP. Early application of this FSP is prohibited. We have not issued any share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents.

The asset and liability under the capital lease are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the asset. The asset is amortized over its estimated productive live. Amortization of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense. Minimum future lease payments under capital leases as of December 31, 2008, were as follows: Amount 2009 $ 14,456 2010 14,456 2011 10,842 Net minimum lease payments 39,754 Amount representing interest (5,325 ) Present value of net minimum lease payments $ 34,429 The interest rate on the capitalized lease is 9.1%.

The 2004 Debentures were convertible into shares of the Companys common stock par value $0.001 (the Common Stock) at a conversion rate equal to $0.25 per share (subject to adjustment if there are certain capital adjustments or similar transactions, such as a stock split or merger). On December 23, 2007, the remaining aggregate principal amount of $330,000 of the 2004 debentures was converted into 1,320,000 shares of Common Stock. F-22 For financial reporting purposes, the Company recorded a discount of $2,193,411 to reflect the value of the warrants issued in connection with the 2004 Debentures and in accordance with EITF No. 00-27, an additional discount on the 2004 Debentures of $2,711,554 to reflect the beneficial conversion feature of the debentures. The estimated value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model under the following assumptions: life of 2.4 years, risk free interest rate of 3.21%, a dividend yield of 0% and volatility of 162%. The discounts were amortized to the date of maturity unless converted earlier. (ii) In May 2006, the Company raised net proceeds of $8.986 million in a private placement of $10,000,000 in principal amount of its two-year 8% Convertible Debentures (the "2006 Debentures"). As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 2006 Debentures was $103,500. The balance was repaid in its entirety in January 2008. Investors in the private placement also received Class A warrants, exercisable through June 30, 2009, to purchase up to 33,333,333 shares of the Company's Common Stock at a per share exercise price of $0.20 and Class B warrants, exercisable through June 30, 2011, to purchase up to 33,333,333 shares of the Companys Common Stock at a per share exercise price of $0.25. In connection with the placement of the 2006 Debentures, the Company paid to a registered broker dealer that acted as placement agent a cash fee of $935,000, agreed to pay 10% of the proceeds realized in the future from exercise of warrants issued to the 2006 Debentures investors, and issued warrants consisting of (x) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,666,667 shares of Common Stock having an initial exercise price equal to $0.15, (y) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,333,333 shares of Common Stock having an initial exercise price equal to $0.20, and (z) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,333,333 shares of Common Stock having an initial exercise price equal to $0.25. Except as specifically noted, these warrants otherwise are on substantially the same terms and conditions as the investor warrants. For financial reporting purposes, the Company recorded a discount of $4,862,878 to reflect the value of the warrants, and in accordance with EITF No. 00-27, an additional discount of $5,137,122 to reflect the beneficial conversion feature of the 2006 Debentures. The estimated value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model under the following weighted average assumptions: life of 4 years, risk free interest rate of 4.99%, a dividend yield of 0% and volatility of 129.65%. The discounts were amortized to the date of maturity unless converted earlier. (iii) On July 31, 2007, the Company entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement (the "July 07 Purchase Agreement") with an institutional investor, Vicis Capital Master Fund (the Investor or "Vicis"), pursuant to which the Investor purchased the Companys Secured Convertible Promissory Note in aggregate principal amount of $7,500,000 (the July 07 Note). The outstanding principal amount of the July 07 Note was originally convertible at the option of the holder, at any time and from time to time, into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.075 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Company and the Investor subsequently agreed to adjust the conversion price of the July 07 Note as follows: 1. In connection with the November 07 Purchase Agreement discussed below, to $0.045 per share. 2. In connection with the January 08 Purchase Agreement discussed below, to $0.035. 3. In connection with the Debenture Amendment Agreement discussed below, to $0.015. Under certain circumstances discussed below, the conversion price may be further adjusted to $0.01. The Company is entitled to require the July 07 Note holder to convert all or a part of the outstanding principal amount of the July 07 Note. In addition, if the closing sale price of the Company's Common Stock as quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is more than $0.375 (which amount may be adjusted for certain capital events, such as stock splits) on each of fifteen consecutive trading days, then, subject to the conditions specified below, within five trading days after the last day in such period, the Company may, at its option (exercised by written notice to the holder of the July 07 Note), require such holder to convert all or any part of the July 07 Note on or before a specified date at the conversion price then in effect. The July 07 Noteholder may continue to convert its note after the Company gives such notice. This right is available only if, on the date the Company gives notice of mandatory conversion and on each trading day thereafter through and including the date of mandatory conversion specified in F-23 the original notice from the Company, a registration statement covering the resale of the Common Stock underlying these securities is effective. The July 07 Note is redeemable at 110% of the principal and accrued interest in the event of certain change of control transactions, and is redeemable at 120% of the principal and accrued interest in the event of certain other triggering events, including (without limitation) events of default and certain other events that would impact the holders ability to publicly re-sell the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the July 07 Note. Pursuant to the July 07 Purchase Agreement, the Company issued Common Stock purchase warrants to the Investor, exercisable through July 31, 2012, to purchase initially up to 150,000,000 shares of Common Stock, of which warrants for 50,000,000 shares (Class A July 07 Warrants) had an original exercise price of $0.06 per share and warrants for 100,000,000 shares (Class B July 07 Warrants; together with the Class A July 07 Warrants, the July 07 Warrants) had an original exercise price of $0.075. The Company and the Investor agreed to adjust the exercise prices of the Class A July 07 Warrants and the Class B July 07 Warrants as follows: 1. In connection with the November 07 Purchase Agreement discussed below, to $0.045 per share and the Class B July 07 Warrants to $0.05 per share. 2. In connection with the January 08 Purchase Agreement discussed below, to $0.035. 3. In connection with the April 08 Purchase Agreement discussed below, to $0.001. As discussed further below, all of these warrants were exercised on November 24, 2008. In connection with this financing, the Company paid fees to a registered broker dealer of $570,000 and issued warrants to purchase up to 17,350,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock at a per share exercise price of $0.075, of which 16.6 million shares were later re-priced to $0.035. For financial reporting purposes, the Company recorded a discount of $3,959,362 to reflect the value of the warrants and in accordance with EITF No. 00-27, an additional discount of $ 2,310,886 to reflect the beneficial conversion feature of the 2007 Convertible Promissory Notes. The estimated value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model under the following weighted average assumptions: life of 5 years, risk free interest rate of 4.88%, a dividend yield of 0% and volatility of 130.22%. The discounts were being amortized to the date of maturity unless converted earlier. As discussed below, the Company and the Investor entered into a Debenture Amendment Agreement. As a result, all of the remaining unamortized discounts were expensed. (iv) On November 1, 2007, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the November 07 Purchase Agreement) with the Investor pursuant to which the Investor purchased the Companys Secured Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $2,500,000 (the November 07 Note). The November 07 Note has a term of three years and becomes due on November 1, 2010. The outstanding principal amount of the November 07 Note was originally convertible at the option of the holder at any time and from time to time into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.045 per share. In connection with the Debenture Amendment Agreement discussed below, the Company and the Investor agreed to adjust the conversion price to $.015 per share. In connection with the issuance of the November 07 Note, the Company issued Common Stock purchase warrants (the November 07 Warrants) to the Investor, exercisable through October 31, 2012, to purchase initially up to 83,333,334 shares of Common Stock, of which warrants for 27,777,778 shares had an original exercise price of $0.045 per share and warrants for 55,555,556 shares had an original exercise price of $0.05 (in each case the "Exercise Price"). The Company and the Investor agreed to adjust the exercise prices of the November 07 Warrants as follows: 1. In connection with the January 08 Purchase Agreement discussed below, the exercise price to $0.035. F-24 2. In connection with the April 08 Purchase Agreement discussed below, the exercise price to $0.001. As discussed further below, all of the November 07 Warrants were exercised on November 24, 2008. Except as otherwise specified below, the investment by the Investor under the November 2007 Purchase Agreement was made on terms substantially similar to those contained in the July 07 Purchase Agreement. Amounts owing under the November 07 Note are also secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. For financial reporting purposes, the Company recorded a discount of $1,127,634 to reflect the value of the November 07 Warrants and in accordance with EITF No. 00-27, an additional discount of $294,301 to reflect the beneficial conversion feature of November 07 Note. The estimated value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model under the following weighted average assumptions: life of 5 years, risk free interest rate of 3.67%, a dividend yield of 0% and volatility of 127.4%. The discounts were being amortized to the date of maturity unless converted earlier. As discussed below, the Company and the Investor entered into a Debenture Amendment Agreement. As a result, all of the remaining unamortized discounts were expensed. (v) On January 15, 2008, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the January 2008 Purchase Agreement) with the Investor pursuant to which the Investor purchased the Companys Secured Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $2,500,000 (the January 08 Note). The January 08 Note has a term of three years and becomes due on January 15, 2011. The outstanding principal amount of the January 08 Note was originally convertible at the option of the holder at any time and from time to time into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.035 per share. In connection with the Debenture Amendment Agreement discussed below, the Company and the Investor agreed to adjust the conversion price to $.015 per share. In connection with the issuance of the January 08 Note, the Company issued Common Stock purchase warrants (the January 08 Warrants) to the Investor, exercisable through January 15, 2013, to purchase up to 107,142,857 shares of Common Stock at an original exercise price of $0.035 per share. In connection with the April 08 Purchase Agreement discussed below, the Company and Investor agreed to adjust the exercise price to $0.001 per share. The Company and the Investor subsequently agreed to adjust the exercise prices of the January 2008 Warrants as discussed below. As discussed further below, all of the January 08 Warrants were exercised on November 24, 2008. Except as otherwise specified below, the investment by the Investor under the January 2008 Purchase Agreement was made on terms substantially similar to those contained in the July 2007 Purchase Agreement. Amounts owing under the January 08 Note are also secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. In connection with the financing, the Company issued, as compensation to a registered broker dealer, warrants to purchase up to 14,999,999 shares of the Company's Common Stock at a per share exercise price of $0.035. For financial reporting purposes, the Company recorded a discount of $1,459,189 to reflect the value of the warrants and in accordance with EITF No. 00-27, an additional discount of $1,040,811 to reflect the beneficial conversion feature of January 08 Note. The estimated value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model under the following weighted average assumptions: life of 5 years, risk free interest rate of 3%, a dividend yield of 0% and volatility of 127.4%. The discounts are being amortized to the date of maturity unless converted earlier. As discussed below, the Company and the Investor entered into a Debenture Amendment Agreement. As a result, all of the remaining unamortized discounts were expensed. Debt Modification On November 21, 2008, the Company and the Investor entered into a Debenture Amendment Agreement (the Debenture Amendment Agreement), pursuant to which the Investor invested in the Company an additional $8 million. In consideration of the investment, the Company reduced the conversion price on the July 07 Note, the November 07 Note and the January 08 Note referred to above to $0.015 per share. The parties also agreed that in the event that on the trading day immediately preceding June 1, 2009, the closing per share price of the Common Stock F-25 is less than $0.10, then the per share conversion price with respect to any amount then outstanding under the Notes would automatically be further adjusted to $0.01. In addition, in consideration for the investment, the parties agreed under the Debenture Amendment Agreement to amend the terms of the Investor Warrants referred to above to remove all conversion caps from the Warrants, which were contractual provisions that prevented the Investor from exercising an amount of such warrants to the extent that the Investor would beneficially own (i) greater than 4.99% of the outstanding Common Stock, and (ii) greater than 9.99% of the outstanding Common Stock. The Company accounted for the modification of the Convertible Promissory Notes, as described above, as an extinguishment of debt in accordance with EITF 05-7  Accounting for Modifications to Conversion Options Embedded in Debt Instruments and Related Issues  and EITF 96-19  Debtors Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments , (EITF 96-19). The Company deemed the terms of the amendment to be substantially different and treated the Convertible Promissory Notes as extinguished and exchanged for new notes. As such, it was necessary to reflect the Convertible Promissory Notes at fair market value and record a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $2.8 million. In accordance with FAS 157, the fair value of the Convertible Promissory Notes was determined utilizing level 3 inputs. The fair value of the Convertible Promissory Notes was calculated utilizing the fully diluted market value of the invested capital of the company immediately before and after the date of the debt modification. The fair value was determined to be the face value of the Convertible Promissory Notes at the date of the debt modification. For financial reporting purposes, the Company recorded a discount in accordance with EITF No. 00-27 of $12,500,000 to reflect the beneficial conversion feature related to the Debenture Modification Agreement. The discount is being amortized to the date of maturity of the various Convertible Promissory Notes unless converted earlier. Contemporaneous with the transaction, on November 24, 2008, the Company issued 464,365,080 shares of its Common Stock to Vicis upon its exercise of all outstanding Investor Warrants through a combination of cashless exercises as well as for cash exercises. See Note 10 for a further discussion. Registration Rights In connection with the entry by the Company and the Investor into the July 07 Purchase Agreement referred to above, the Company originally undertook to file, by December 28, 2007, a registration statement (the "Registration Statement") covering the Common Stock underlying the July 07 Note and the July 07 Warrants. Under certain circumstances, the Company undertook to pay liquidated damages to the holders of the July 07 Note if the Registration Statement is filed late and/or is not declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission within the earlier of (i) five days after notice by the Securities and Exchange Commission that the registration statement may be declared effective or (ii) March 29, 2008. In connection with the entry into the November 07 Purchase Agreement, the Companys obligation to file such Registration Statement (which would now also cover the resale of the shares of Common Stock underlying the November 07 Note and November 07 Warrants) was extended to January 27, 2008 and that the Companys obligation to pay liquidated damages in respect of delayed effectiveness of such registration statement would not commence until April 28, 2008. Thereafter, in connection with the entry by the Company an the Investor into the April 08 Purchase Agreement (further discussed in Note 8 above), the date by which the Company was obligated to file the Registration Statement (covering the resale of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Notes and Investor Warrants) was further extended to December 15, 2008 and that the Companys obligation to pay liquidated damages in respect of delayed effectiveness of such registration statement would not commence until April 28, 2008. Finally, in connection with the Debenture Amendment Agreement consummated in November 2008, the Investor agreed to waive, until further notice, the Companys obligat ion to file on or before December 15, 2008, a resale registration statement with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Notes and the Warrants. Interest incurred on convertible debt amounted to $671,461 and $1,189,537 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, of which $671,461 and $888,371 related to Vicis. Amortization of the discounts related to the convertible debentures and notes above totaled $2,482,288 and $7,600,218 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. F-26 NOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES At December 31, 2008, the Company had available $68 million of net operating loss carry forwards, for U.S. income tax purposes which expire in the years 2016 through 2028. However, due to changes in stock ownership, the use of the U.S. net operating loss carry forwards is severely limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As such, approximately $61 million of these net operating loss carry forwards will expire as worthless. The Company has ceased its foreign operations and has abandoned the foreign net operating loss carry forwards. Due to the uncertainty of their realization, no income tax benefit has been recorded by the Company for these loss carry forwards as valuation allowances have been established for any such benefits. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets for U.S. income taxes are as follows: December 31, 2008 2007 Net operating loss carry forwards $ 2,735,184 $ 12,307,020 Stock based compensation 355,734 261,022 Other 555,204 493,712 Total deferred tax assets 3,646,122 13,061,754 Valuation allowance (3,646,122 ) (13,061,754 ) Net deferred tax assets $  $  The decrease in the valuation allowance was primarily due to the changes in stock ownership that occurred in 2008 thereby increasing the Section 382 limitation in the net operating loss carryfowards available to the Company. The following is a reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate of 35% for 2008 and 2007, with the provision for income taxes: December 31, 2008 2007 Statutory tax rate (35 %) (35 %) Valuation allowance 35 % 35 % Effective federal tax rate 0 % 0 % The provisions of FIN 48 were adopted by the Company on January 1, 2007 and had no effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows or results of operations upon adoption, as the Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits. The Company also evaluated its tax positions as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 and reached the same conclusion. The Company does not currently expect any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009. The Company's practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties. In certain cases, the Company's uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. The Company files U.S. and state income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. The 2005 through 2008 tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities F-27 NOTE 10 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY COMMON STOCK On June 27, 2008, the Company's stockholders approved an increase in the authorized shares of Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue up to 2,000,000,000 shares. STOCK OPTION PLANS In November 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2000 Incentive Plan"). A total of 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock were originally reserved for issuance under the 2000 Incentive Plan. The 2000 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, bonus stock, awards in lieu of cash obligations, other stock-based awards and performance units. The 2000 Incentive Plan also permits cash payments under certain conditions. In December 2002, the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 2000 Incentive Plan was increased from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000; in June 2005, it was further increased to 25,000,000. On June 27, 2008, the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 2000 Incentive Plan was further increased to 50,000,000 shares. The compensation committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for determining the type of award, when and to whom awards are granted, the number of shares and the terms of the awards and exercise prices. The options are exercisable for a period not to exceed ten years from the date of grant. Vesting periods range from immediately to four years. In December 2002, the Company adopted the 2002 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (the "2002 Directors Plan") providing for the issuance of up to 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock to non-employee directors. Under the 2002 Directors Plan, only non-qualified options may be issued, and they will be exercisable for a period of six years from the date of grant. In June 2005, the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 2002 Directors Plan was increased from 2,000,000 to 4,000,000, in May 2006, it was further increased to 6,000,000. On June 27, 2008, the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 2002 Directors Plan was further increased to 12,000,000 shares. OTHER OPTION GRANTS In addition to the options granted under the stock option plans discussed above (the "Plans), the Company has issued options outside of the Plans, pursuant to various employment, consulting and separation agreements. Option activity for 2008 and 2007 is summarized as follows: Plan Nonplan Total Weighted Average Exercise Price Options outstanding, January 1, 2007 18,913,250 3,720,000 22,633,250 $ 0.25 Granted 10,492,500  10,492,500 0.05 Exercised     Forfeited (818,750 )  (818,750 ) 0.41 Options outstanding, December 31, 2007 28,587,000 3,720,000 32,307,000 0.25 Granted 1,700,000 200,000 1,900,000 0.03 Exercised     Forfeited (1,675,000 ) (145,000 ) (1,820,000 ) 0.16 Options outstanding, December 31, 2008 28,612,000 3,775,000 32,387,000 $ 0.17 Shares of Common Stock available for Future grant under the plans 31,787,100 F-28 The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2008: Weighted Average Remaining Options Exercisable Weighted Average Ranges of price Number Outstanding Contractual Life Exercise Price Number Exercisable Exercise Price $ 0.03-.045 10,992,500 8.21 $ 0.043 9,292,500 $ 0.045 $ .06 - $.15 1,120,000 5.85 $ 0.118 1,120,000 $ 0.118 $ .20 - $.30 18,049,500 4.21 $ 0.206 16,999,500 $ 0.207 $ 0.50 2,225,000 3.54 $ 0.500 2,225,000 $ 0.500 $ .03-$0.50 32,387,000 5.58 $ 0.168 29,637,000 $ 0.175 Share based compensation - The fair values of stock options granted were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2008 2007 Risk free interest rate 1.45%- 1.87% 3.67% - 4.75% Expected life 1.5 -5.75 5.75 Expected volatility 133% - 162% 127%- 143% Dividend yield   Weighted-average grant date fair value per share $ 0.019 $ 0.029 WARRANTS On April 23, 2008, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "April 08 Purchase Agreement") with the Investor referred to in Note 8 above pursuant to which the Company issued to the Investor, in consideration of an investment of $3,000,000, warrants (the April 2008 Warrants), exercisable through April 2013, to purchase up to 135,000,000 shares of the Companys Common Stock, at a per share exercise price of $0.001.

Following the exercise of these warrants, Vicis controls approximately 66% of the Company issued and outstanding common stock. A summary of the warrants outstanding at December 31, 2008 is as follows: Warrants Exercise Price Expiration Date 44,266,665 $0.035 2012 - 2013 750,000 $0.075 2012 10,666,667 $ 0.15 2011 36,766,666 $ 0.20 2009 36,766,666 $ 0.25 2009- 2011 129,216,664 F-29 NOTE 11 - SALES AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Hardware $ 12,136,283 $ 2,179,076 Software and services 486,070 85,902 $ 12,622,353 $ 2,264,978 One customer accounted for 100% and 97% of the hardware revenue for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

On January 13, 2009 the Company extended the lease through August 31, 2009. No other terms of the lease have been changed.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Corporation Law") empowers a Delaware corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe the persons conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful. In the case of an action by or in the right of the corporation, Section 145 empowers a corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or complete action in any of the capacities set forth above against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in and not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that indemnification is not permitted in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person is adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all of the circumstances o f the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such court deems proper. Section 145 further provides that a Delaware corporation is required to indemnify a director, officer, employee or agent against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any action, suit or proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein as to which such person has been successful on the merits or otherwise; that indemnification provided for by Section 145 not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the indemnified party may be entitled; that indemnification provided for by Section 145 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of such person's heirs, executors and administrators; and empowers the corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a director or officer against any such liability assert ed against such person in any such capacity or arising out of the persons status as such whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against liability under II-1 Section 145. A Delaware corporation may provide indemnification only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct. Such determination is to be made (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even through less than a quorum or (ii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iii) by the stockholders. Section 7 of the Registrant's certificate of incorporation contains the following provisions with respect to the elimination or limitation of liability of the Registrant's directors: The directors and officers of the corporation shall be entitled to such rights of indemnification and advancement of expenses, including attorneys fees, in the defense of any action or threatened action in which a director or officer is or may be a party as the Board of Directors may by resolution prescribe. The Registrant's by-laws provide that it will indemnify its directors, executive officers, other officers, employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by law. Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware Corporation Law provides that the Certificate of Incorporation of a Delaware corporation may contain a provision eliminating the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, provided that such provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for (i) any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) the payment of unlawful dividends or the making of unlawful stock purchases or redemptions or (iv) any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Article NINTH of the Registrant's certificate of incorporation provides that: "To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of the Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages, breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article NINTH by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification."

UNDERTAKINGS. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement. (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; II-6 Provided, however , that: Paragraphs (1)(i), (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) of this section do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the registrant pursuant to section 13 or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement. (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser: (i) If the registrant is relying on Rule 430B: (A) Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and (B) Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof; provided, however , that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date; or (ii) If the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediatel y prior to such date of first use. (5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: II-7 The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the registrant's annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan's annual report pursuant to section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whe ther such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that: (1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
