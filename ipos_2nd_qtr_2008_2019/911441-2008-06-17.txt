YOU SHOULD READ THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS CAREFULLY, ESPECIALLY THE "RISK FACTORS" SECTION AND OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES APPEARING AT THE END OF THIS, BEFORE DECIDING TO INVEST IN OUR COMMON STOCK." OUR COMPANY ESP, through its wholly owned subsidiary Environmental Safeguard Professionals, Inc. ("Safeguard"), offers various inspection services for addressing mold and moisture intrusion that can have an acute or chronic negative impact on the indoor air quality of commercial and residential buildings. ESP, through its wholly owned subsidiary National Professional Services, Inc. ("NPS"), offers annual trade memberships and management services for industry related associations. Safeguard has developed a standardized training, certification, inspection, and results reporting analysis program which forms the foundation of a suite of services that together comprise our Certified Environmental Home Inspector ("CEHI") program. This business unit provides annual subscription-based moisture maintenance and energy use awareness programs to both residential and commercial clients. NPS is currently a conglomerate of seven individual associations and maintains annual paying members. The focus of this business unit is to establish cross-training on CEHI programs and to provide information concerning residential environmental issues, to establish training for underwriters, loan officers and appraisers, and to educate these groups about CEHI inspection protocols. Training programs for insurance companies, underwriters, loss control, and risk management personnel educate and emphasize the benefits of using a CEHI on the initial inspection and then establishing annual inspections.

YOU SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW, TOGETHER WITH ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS PROSPECTUS, BEFORE YOU DECIDE WHETHER TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. IF ANY OF THESE ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WE FACE. ADDITIONAL RISKS NOT CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY DO NOT DEEM MATERIAL ALSO MAY BECOME IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE DUE TO ANY OF THESE DESCRIBED OR ADDITIONAL RISKS AND YOU COULD LOSE PART OR ALL OF YOUR INVESTMENT. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY, WHICH COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. We began offering our environmental inspection services as Environmental Service Professionals, Inc. in October 2006 and our association management services in July 2007. Accordingly, we have a limited operating history and, as a result, we have limited financial data that you can use to evaluate our business and prospects. Our business model is evolving and it may not be successful. As a result of these factors, the future revenue and income potential of our business is uncertain. Although we have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods, we may not be able to sustain this growth. Any evaluation of our business and our prospects must be considered in light of these factors and the risks and uncertainties often encountered by companies in our state of development. Some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to do the following: -4- o Maintain and expand our current relationships, and develop new relationships with state, federal and environmental regulatory bodies o Gain the acceptance of the commercial and residential insurance industry to a level where they will consider offering a discount to their policyholders, if their customers/insured's receive an initial inspection services and then participate in an annual inspection program o Maintain and expand our current relationships, and develop new relationships with the industry stakeholders including insurance, mortgage, and banking businesses, and realtors, builders, asset managers and the consumer o Continue to grow our revenue and meet anticipated growth targets o Manage our expanding operations and implement and improve our operational, financial, and management controls o Respond effectively to competition o Implement ESP's national marketing campaign o Attract and retain qualified management and employees o Attract the existing top tier home and moisture inspectors nationwide and to become approved vendors as independent contractors in order to deliver the CEHI Program of services If we are unable to address these risks, our business, results of operation, and prospects could suffer. LACK OF PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE OF OUR SERVICES WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT OUR SALES AND PROFITABILITY. Our business is speculative and dependent upon the acceptance of our services as an effective and reliable method to perform indoor air quality and energy use inspections. Our business is also dependent on the effectiveness of our marketing program to convince potential clients and potential independent contractors to utilize our services so that we will become profitable. We cannot assure that the public or industry stakeholders will accept our inspection services, or that we will be successful or that our business will earn any profit. We cannot assure that we will earn any revenues or that investors will not lose their entire investment. We cannot assure that we will operate our business successfully or that our common stock will have value. A failure of our marketing campaign would have a material adverse impact on its operating results, financial condition and business performance. WE MAY RISK EXPOSURE FROM LIABILITY CLAIMS. Environmental inspectors face the risk of exposure to liability claims in the event that the use of analysis reports or reliance on inspection protocols cause property damage, injury or illness as a result of contamination from environmental hazards that were included in such analysis, inspection protocols, or otherwise. We expect to maintain sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance. However, such insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost, or, if available, may not be adequate to cover all liabilities. Although we intend to seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying its services, such indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers. If we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce our future net earnings and earnings per share. WE MAY BE HARMED BY ACTIONS TAKEN BY OUR ENVIRONMENTAL INSPECTORS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL. A significant portion of our environmental inspectors are independent contractors and are not our employees. We provide training and support to the environmental inspectors, but the quality of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Consequently, our environmental inspectors may not successfully operate in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, or may not hire and train qualified personnel. Our image and reputation, and the image and reputation of other environmental inspectors, may suffer materially and system-wide sales could significantly decline if our environmental inspectors do not operate successfully. WE MAY BECOME RELIANT ON TECHNOLOGY FOR EFFICIENT OPERATIONS WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS IN THE SHORT TERM AND MAKE US VULNERABLE TO DISRUPTIONS. The need to synchronize data and the related information which is key to our on-line work flow system. Global trends are moving toward developing and adopting standardized protocols for data synchronization. The implementation of these protocols will be an added expense encountered by us in executing our business strategy. One of the greatest coordination challenges for us is having inspectors utilize on-line work flow systems effectively to ensure efficient and effective service to our clients and to capture the mission critical data post inspection. The Internet is playing a growing role in creating an automated communications network for presenting, tracking, and capturing this mission critical information. We believe that we will need to develop a network to enable the on-line work flow system on the Internet in order to operate profitability which could increase our operating costs in the short term. -5- Our ability to reduce costs in the long term and increase profits, as well as our ability to serve customers most effectively, may depend on the reliability of our technology network. We expect to use software and other technology systems to dispatch inspectors in the most efficient manner to optimize the use of standardized inspection and analysis protocols and minimize the time spent at each stop. Any disruption to these computer systems in the future could adversely impact our customer service, decrease the volume of our business, and result in increased costs. While we expect to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, we recognize that these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on operations and profits. OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, IN PART, DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO COMPLETE AND MANAGE ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES. Our primary strategy is to achieve growth through acquisitions of businesses. We may not be able to make acquisitions in the future and any acquisitions we do make may not be successful. Furthermore, future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect upon our operating results, particularly in periods immediately following the consummation of those transactions while the operations of the acquired businesses are being integrated into our operations. Achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends on the timely, efficient and successful execution of a number of post-acquisition events, including integrating the business of the acquired company into our operations, marketing programs, and reporting and information systems. We may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired company's operations or personnel, or realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Our ability to integrate acquisitions may be adversely affected by many factors, including the relatively large size of a business and the allocation of our limited management resources among various integration efforts. In connection with the acquisitions of businesses in the future, we may decide to consolidate the operations of any acquired business with our existing operations or make other changes with respect to the acquired business, which could result in special charges or other expenses. Our results of operations also may be adversely affected by expenses we incur in making acquisitions, by amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets with definite lives and by additional depreciation attributable to acquired assets. Any of the businesses we acquire may also have liabilities or adverse operating issues, including some that we fail to discover before the acquisition, and our indemnity for such liabilities typically has been limited and may, with respect to future acquisitions, also be limited. Additionally, our ability to make any future acquisitions may depend upon obtaining additional financing. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. To the extent that we seek to acquire other businesses in exchange for our common stock, fluctuations in our stock price could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete acquisitions. WE HAVE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS WILL BE COMPLETED. Our business strategy, in part, is to expand our operations through strategic acquisitions. We have not entered into any agreements, arrangements or understandings to acquire any operating companies, and we cannot assure that any acquisition will be completed for any number of reasons. These reasons include, but are not limited to, our ability to obtain funding, complete the necessary due diligence to our satisfaction, agree on all material terms of definitive purchase agreements, obtain audited financial statements consistent with the unaudited financial statements, or otherwise consummate the acquisition of any or all of such entities. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MANAGE PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS AND ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY. In the event that we are able to complete any acquisitions, such acquisitions would present numerous challenges to us. These include, but are not limited to, the integration of the acquired entities with our operations, technologies and management and the attendant risks associated with such acquisitions, including, but not limited to, possible unanticipated liabilities, unanticipated costs, and diversion of management attention or loss of personnel. We cannot assure you that we will successfully integrate or profitably manage any acquired businesses, that our continued business will achieve sales levels, profitability, efficiencies or synergies that justify the acquisitions, or that the acquisitions will result in increased earnings for us in any future period. Successful integration of our operations will depend on, among other things, our ability to attract, hire and retain skilled management and other personnel, none of which can be assured. To manage growth effectively, we will need to invest in development of enhancements to existing services, implement operational, financial and management information systems, procedures and controls, and integrate our personnel and operations with those of an acquired company. We cannot assure that we will be able to manage the combined operations effectively, and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results. -6- WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS. While we will conduct whatever due diligence we can with regard to all acquisitions, there may be significant undisclosed liabilities associated with an entity that might not be known to us prior to an acquisition. The indemnities and warranties that we will receive in connection with the proposed acquisitions might not fully cover such liabilities, in which case our operations may be adversely affected. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE AGAINST COMPANIES WITH SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER RESOURCES. The indoor air quality testing industry is extremely competitive. Our principal competitors include other indoor air quality testers, certified industrial hygienists, home inspectors, termite inspectors, and remediation and abatement companies. These competitors may have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger installed customer bases, and substantially greater financial and marketing resources than ESP. We believe that the principal factors affecting competition in this proposed market include name recognition, and the ability to receive referrals based on client confidence in our services. There are no significant barriers of entry that could keep potential competitors from opening similar indoor air quality testing facilities. Our ability to compete successfully in the industry will depend in large part upon our ability to market and sell our indoor air quality testing services and to respond effectively to changing insurance industry standards and methodology. We cannot assure that ESP will be able to compete successfully in the indoor air quality testing industry, or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME BE SUBJECT TO DISPUTES WITH CUSTOMERS AND VENDORS RELATING TO AMOUNTS INVOICED FOR SERVICES PROVIDED WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESOLVE IN OUR FAVOR. It is not unusual in our industry to occasionally have disagreements with vendors relating to amounts billed for services provided between the recipient of the services and the vendor. To the extent we are unable to favorably resolve these disputes, our revenues, profitability or cash may be adversely affected. OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS UNCERTAIN. We rely on know-how and trade secrets to maintain our competitive position. Confidentiality agreements or other agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technology, know-how, trade secrets, or other proprietary information in the event of misappropriation, unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements, or, even if such agreements are legally enforceable, we may not have adequate remedies for breaches of such agreements. The failure of our agreements to protect our proprietary technology could result in significantly lower revenues, reduced profit margins or loss of market share. The market for our services depends to some extent upon the goodwill associated with our trademarks and service marks. We own, or have licenses to use, the material trademarks, service marks and trade names used in connection with the marketing and performance of our services in the markets where those services are sold. Therefore, trademark protection is important to our business. Although our trademarks and service marks are registered in the United States, we may not be successful in asserting trademark protection. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our trademarks or service marks to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The loss or infringement of our trademarks or service marks could impair the goodwill associated with our brands, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES FOR THE NEAR FUTURE. We project that we will continue to incur development and administrative expenses and operate at a loss for up to the next three years unless we are able to complete several acquisitions or generate substantial revenues from inspection and membership services. We cannot be certain whether or when we will be able to achieve profitability because of the significant uncertainties with respect to our business. OUR CURRENT CAPITALIZATION IS INADEQUATE AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE THE REQUIRED CAPITAL TO CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS. We have incurred substantial indebtedness through short-term bridge loans and other short term loans made to us during the past 12 months by investors and lenders. These loans have maturity dates occurring in the second quarter of 2008. We must raise substantial equity capital in order to refinance these short-term loans because our businesses do not have sufficient revenue to service the debt. We cannot assure that we will be able to raise the necessary capital to repay our debt. If we default on the debt, a significant portion of which is secured by our assets, then we could lose our businesses and related assets, causing investors to lose their entire investment in us. Furthermore, we cannot assure that we will not incur debt in the future, that we will have sufficient funds to repay our indebtedness, or that we will not default on our -7- debt, jeopardizing our business viability. We may not be able to borrow or raise additional capital in the future to meet our needs or to otherwise provide the capital necessary to conduct our business. We will require additional capital resources including, but not limited to, exercise of outstanding warrants, in order to conduct our operations and raise sufficient working capital, as well as in order to grow and expand our business. Future events may lead to increased costs that could make it difficult for us to succeed. To raise additional capital, we may be required to sell additional equity securities, or accept debt financing or obtain financing through a bank or other entity. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional stock, there may be a significant dilution in the value of our outstanding common stock. We may not have binding arrangements with respect to additional financings, even though we have signed investment and financing commitments. If we so require, future financing may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We cannot assure that any additional financings will be available to us, that we will be able to obtain additional loans, or that adequate funds for our operations will otherwise be available when needed or on terms that are acceptable to us. The inability to secure additional financing would prevent us from achieving profitability and would have a material adverse effect upon us, which may result in the loss of your investment in ESP. OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. Our business is subject to various federal, state and local laws that govern indoor air quality assessors and hygienists, business licensing, and those governing health, safety, the rights of employees, employment discrimination, wrongful termination, wages, hours, taxes, quality of service, and other matters. A failure by us or our independent environmental inspectors to comply with applicable government regulations or insurance company requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business operations. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED ASSUMING THAT WE WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. The accompanying financial statements to this registration statement have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 15 to the financial statements, we generated net losses of $21,468,106 during the period from September 29, 1992 (inception) through December 31, 2007. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent on our ability to meet our obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required, and ultimately to attain profitability. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management plans to raise additional funds through debt or equity offerings. We are insolvent unless and until we raise adequate capital to repay our short-term indebtedness which is in default. There is no guarantee that we will be able to raise any capital through any type of offerings. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN DEFAULT ON OUR BRIDGE LOANS. We have failed to repay our bridge loans on a timely basis. Currently, our bridge loan lenders are exercising forbearance on a voluntary day-to-day basis. We cannot assure that our lenders will continue to refrain from enforcement and foreclosure on their loans. If we are not able to repay or refinance bridge loans, we may experience foreclosure on our assets and a cessation of our business. In such circumstances you may lose your entire investment in ESP. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO REPURCHASE STOCK ISSUED TO CERTAIN BRIDGE LOAN LENDERS. We have an obligation to repurchase stock issued to certain bridge loan lenders. We cannot assure that we will have sufficient funds to repurchase the stock and we may default on this obligation. Currently, we have an obligation to repurchase 215,321 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.00 per share. OUR BUSINESS MAY BE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE ECONOMY AND GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS. Our business could be affected by general economic conditions and those specific to the inspection, real-estate and energy management industries. In addition, our business could be affected by geopolitical events such as war, threat of war or terrorist actions. Such an economic downturn or geopolitical event could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. IF WE WERE TO LOSE THE SERVICES OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. Our success is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. Given our early stage of operation, we are dependent on our ability to retain and motivate high quality personnel. Although we believe we will be able to engage qualified personnel for such purposes, an inability to do so could materially adversely affect our ability to market and -8- perform our services. The loss of one or more of our key employees or our inability to hire and retain other qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE, RETAIN OR MOTIVATE QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, CONSULTANTS, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND ADVISORS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GROW EFFECTIVELY. Our performance will be largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition for such qualified employees is intense. If we do not succeed in attracting excellent personnel or in retaining or motivating them, we may be unable to grow effectively. In addition, our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain key consultants and advisors. We cannot assure that any skilled individuals will agree to become an employee, consultant or independent contractor of ESP. Our inability to retain their services could negatively impact our business and our ability to execute our business strategy. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS HAVE LIMITED LIABILITY. As permitted by the Nevada General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws limit the personal liability of our directors and stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or stockholder, but such provision does not eliminate or limit the liability of a director in certain circumstances, such as for: (i) any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii) under Section 174 of the Nevada General Corporate Law; or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If we were called upon to perform under our indemnification agreement, then the portion of our assets expended for such purpose would reduce the amount otherwise available for our business. RISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES UNTIL OCTOBER 2006, WE WERE A PUBLIC SHELL COMPANY. THERE ARE CERTAIN RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSACTIONS WITH PUBLIC SHELL COMPANIES GENERALLY, INCLUDING INCREASED SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION SCRUTINY AND REGULATION AND LACK OF ANALYST COVERAGE. Prior to October 2006, we were effectively a public shell company with no material assets or operations and our only value was that we maintained current filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and a class of securities that was traded on the OTC Bulletin Board. Substantial additional risks are associated with a public shell merger transaction such as the absence of accurate or adequate public information concerning the public shell; undisclosed liabilities; improper accounting; claims or litigation from former officers, directors, employees or stockholders; contractual obligations; regulatory requirements and others. Although management performed due diligence on the public shell company, there can be no assurance that such risks do not occur. The occurrence of any such risk could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Security analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of us. No assurance can be given that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary public offerings on our behalf or make a market in our stock in the future. OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE CONSIDERED A "PENNY STOCK" AND MAY BE DIFFICULT TO SELL. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define "penny stock" to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share and therefore may be designated as a "penny stock" according to SEC rules. This designation requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares. In addition, since our common stock is currently traded on the NASD's OTC Bulletin Board, investors may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations of our common stock and may experience a lack of buyers to purchase such stock or a lack of market makers to support the stock price. OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS HAVE SIGNIFICANT VOTING POWER AND MAY TAKE ACTIONS THAT MAY NOT BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OTHER SHAREHOLDERS. As of May 31, 2008, our executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders who hold 5% or more of our outstanding common stock beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 67.812% of our outstanding common stock. These shareholders are able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely -9- affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of all our shareholders. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL BE EFFECTIVE UNDER SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002. Given the complexities and inherent risks associated with the operation of internal control over financial reporting, we can provide no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX"). Moreover, we can provide no assurance as to any matters that might be reported in our management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm's audit report. If we are not able to implement the requirements relating to internal controls and all other provisions of Section 404 in a timely fashion or achieve adequate compliance with these requirements or other requirements of SOX, we might become subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the SEC or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA"). Any such action may materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and the value of our securities, including our common stock. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could result in a lower trading price for our securities. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN, AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO BE, VOLATILE WITH LIMITED LIQUIDITY. The trading prices of our common stock and the securities of service companies generally have been highly volatile. Trading volume has been extremely light and may not increase, resulting in limited liquidity for stockholders. The trading price of our common stock may decline or fail to appreciate. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock will include: o variations in our operating results; o announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; o recruitment or departure of key personnel; o changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; o developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights; o the gain or loss of significant customers; o market conditions in the inspection industry, the industries of our customers, and the economy as a whole; and o adoption or modification of regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business. In addition, if the market for service company stocks or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OF AN ESTABLISHED PUBLIC TRADING MARKET, AND THE FAILURE TO ESTABLISH ONE WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF OUR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SECURITIES IN THE PUBLIC MARKET. At present, there is minimal trading of our securities, and there can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop. Our common stock is traded on the OTC Bulletin Board. The OTC Bulletin Board is an inter-dealer, over-the-counter market that provides significantly less liquidity than FINRA's automated quotation system, or NASDAQ Stock Market. Quotes for stocks included on the OTC Bulletin Board are not listed in the financial sections of newspapers as are those for the NASDAQ Stock Market. Therefore, prices for securities traded solely on the OTC Bulletin Board may be difficult to obtain and holders of common stock may be unable to resell their securities at or near their original price or at any price. TRADING ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD MAY BE DETRIMENTAL TO INVESTORS. Securities traded on the OTC Bulletin Board generally have limited trading volume and exhibit a wide spread between the bid/ask quotations. We cannot predict whether a more active market for our common stock will develop in the future. In the absence of an active trading market, investors may have difficulty buying and selling our common stock or obtaining market quotations, market visibility for our common stock may be limited, and a lack of visibility for our common stock may have a depressive effect on the market price for our common stock. -10- A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUR SHARES WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR SALE, AND THEIR SALE COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. Sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock. We are registering an aggregate of 12,402,637 shares, or 19.8% of our common stock on a fully diluted basis, for resale in the public market pursuant to this registration statement. As such shares of our common stock are resold in the public market, the supply of our common stock will increase, which could decrease its price. Some or all of our shares of common stock as well as shares of common stock underlying warrants may also be offered from time to time in the open market pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144, and these sales may have a depressive effect on the market for our shares of common stock. In general, a non affiliate who has held restricted shares for a period of six months may sell into the market shares of our common stock. IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely impact our public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, management's assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure of management's assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure of our public accounting firm's attestation to or report on management's assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. WE DO NOT FORESEE PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We have not paid cash dividends on our stock and do not plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. WE MAY USE OUR PREFERRED STOCK AS AN ANTI-TAKEOVER DEVICE. We are authorized to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value. The preferred stock may be issued in series from time to time with such designation, voting and other rights, preferences and limitations as our Board of Directors may determine by resolution. Unless the nature of a particular transaction and applicable statutes require such approval, the Board of Directors has the authority to issue these shares without stockholder approval subject to approval of the holders of our preferred stock. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of ESP without any further action by our stockholders. WE ARE SUBJECT TO CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND WE MAY INTERPRET OR IMPLEMENT REQUIRED POLICIES INCORRECTLY. We will follow generally accepted accounting principles for the U.S. in preparing our financial statements. As part of this process, we must make many estimates and judgments about future events. These affect the value of the assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses that we report in our financial statements. We believe these estimates and judgments are reasonable, and we make them in accordance with our accounting policies based on information available at the time. However, actual results could differ from our estimates, and this could require us to record adjustments to expenses or revenues that could be material to our financial position and results of operations in future periods. IF WE DO NOT KEEP THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT CURRENT, THE SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS' ABILITY TO SELL THE COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THEIR WARRANTS WILL BE LIMITED. We must maintain this registration statement on Form S-1 current and effective with the SEC in order for selling security holders listed therein or their assignees to be able to receive registered shares of common stock upon exercise of the Warrants. We may not be able to maintain a registration statement in effect throughout the period during which the Warrants remain exercisable. Provided such registration statement is kept effective, following any sale made by selling security holders of their shares of common stock underlying the Warrants, prospective purchasers shall receive registered common stock. Maintaining an effective registration statement requires substantial continuing expenses for legal and accounting fees and we cannot guarantee our ability to keep the registration statement effective. -11- FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus, including the sections entitled "Prospectus Summary," "Risk Factors," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Description of Business," contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond our ability to control or predict and that may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

USE OF PROCEEDS If the Selling Security Holders determine to exercise their Warrants in order to sell shares under this prospectus, we will receive the proceeds of the exercise of the Warrants. If all of the Warrants are exercised, we would receive net proceeds of $7,429,266. We plan to use any such net proceeds for acquisitions, advertising and marketing, and as working capital. The amounts actually expended for each such use, if any, are at our discretion and may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors, including the amount of such proceeds, future revenue growth and the amount of cash generated by our operations. To the extent we do not utilize such proceeds immediately, such proceeds will be invested in United States government or governmental agency securities or short-term insured certificates of deposit. -12- DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The shares of common stock are being offered for sale by the selling security holders at prices established on the OTC Bulletin Board or in negotiated transactions during the term of this offering. These prices will fluctuate based on the demand for the shares. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS COMMON STOCK Our common stock is listed on the OTC Bulletin Board and trades under the symbol "EVSP." At the close of business on May 31, 2008 there were 50,357,879 issued and outstanding common shares which were held by approximately 200 shareholders of record, of which 3,290,182 shares were free trading. The balance is restricted stock as that term is used in Rule 144 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The following table sets forth the quarterly high and low closing sales prices of the common stock for 2006 and 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 as reported by Yahoo! Finance. Such prices represent prices between dealers and do not include retail mark-ups, mark-downs or commissions and may not represent actual transactions. 2006 HIGH LOW 2007 HIGH LOW 2008 HIGH LOW - ------------------ -------- ---------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ----------------- -------------- ---------- First Quarter N/A N/A First Quarter $1.25 $0.52 First Quarter $0.25 $0.14 Second Quarter N/A N/A Second Quarter $1.40 $0.51 Third Quarter N/A N/A Third Quarter $2.20 $0.40 Fourth Quarter $1.50 $0.10 Fourth Quarter $0.76 $0.15 There is currently minimal trading volume for our securities. During the period from January 1, 2006 through March 31, 2008, our common stock traded at a high of $2.20 and a low of $0.10. DIVIDENDS We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The decision whether to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be made by our Board of Directors, in their discretion, and will depend on our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements and other factors that our Board of Directors considers significant. We currently intend to retain our earnings for funding growth and, therefore, do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION See "Executive Compensation-- Employee Benefit Plans." MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITH OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES APPEARING AT THE END OF THIS PROSPECTUS. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REFLECTING OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. ACTUAL RESULTS AND THE TIMING OF EVENTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS" BEGINNING ON PAGE 3 AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS PROSPECTUS. OVERVIEW Environmental Service Professionals, Inc. (hereinafter, "we," "us," "ESP" or the "Company") is a California-based, Nevada corporation, which through its various acquisitions offers environmental services for addressing mold and moisture intrusion and the associated acute or chronic issues that impact the interior air quality of commercial and residential buildings. We have evolved and focused on developing and delivering what management believes to be state-of-the-art, "Best in Class" procedures, tools and education to provide services for addressing moisture and mold related and other environmental issues (for example: radon and allergy testing) for the residential and commercial real estate industries. Management believes that our procedures, tools and education bring a real opportunity to provide a standardized pro-active approach to the highly fragmented and relatively unsophisticated inspection industry. -13- Management believes that we are the first company of its kind to be able to support a pro-active comprehensive annual inspection called the Mold and Moisture Management Program ("MMM Program"). The MMM Program is available for all residential properties that have passed our Certified Mold and Moisture Inspection Process ("CMI"). Management believes that our acquisition of seven real estate industry associations has provided the access to train and provide its members with information that is consistent with ESP's approach. Within the next two months, we intend to acquire Porter Valley Software, Inc., an inspection software company. Management anticipates that this acquisition will be absorbed into the corporate entity to provide support across the various business units and will become a core component of the highly advanced and standardized on-line and automated procedural protocols developed in concert with each of the other three participants in the industry, ESP, National Association of Moisture Management ("NAMM"), and EMLab P&K. BUSINESS UNIT DESCRIPTIONS ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARD PROFESSIONALS, INC. ("SAFEGUARD") - WEB SITE: HTTP://WWW.ESPUSA.NET We have re-aligned this business unit to provide the home inspection industry with what we believe to be state-of-the-art procedures for environmental services. Safeguard's primary focus is on the standardized Certified Moisture Investigation ("CMI") focusing on moisture intrusion issues that may impact the interior air quality of commercial and residential buildings and the health of its occupants. We also offer advanced residential services including: allergen screening, radon testing, neighborhood environmental reports and home energy tune-ups. We only utilize certified environmental home inspectors who possess nationally recognized certifications and follow our "Best in Class" industry practices. These protocols were developed by NAMM and offer detailed interpretive reports and a consultation with a certified industrial hygienist consultation based on independent laboratory analysis. Certified documents and expert witness services are also available. We provide a pro-active annual maintenance service for homeowners, property management companies and builders. The MMM Program allows clients to manage their liability and protect their property from serious chronic moisture issues. Management believes that ESP is the first company of its kind to be able to support the MMM Program. We have centralized our national call center and customer services offices to Palm Springs, California. NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, INC. ("NPS") - WEB SITE: HTTP://WWW.NPSERVICESINC.COM NPS' services include complete organization and association management, advisory council and board of director coordination, seminars, conferences, graphic design and printing, accounting and reporting and consulting. NPS provides comprehensive management services for seven different membership organizations of which four are both national and international organizations. NPS maintains a servicing facility in Phoenix, Arizona which includes a fully trained staff, conference room, library, accounting services and a computer room updated with the latest server technology. NPS is a full service association management company with the ability to work with trade associations that have between 250 members to 50,000 members. GROWTH STRATEGY Currently the industry as a whole lacks a predominant brand, lacks uniform inspection and reporting protocols, has inconsistent product and service pricing, and no consistent public outreach program. Management believes that cursory web searching tends to confirm the fragmented and relatively unsophisticated nature of the industry. Management believes that there are a few participants who are trying to build a national presence and/or a certified network of independent inspectors, but there is no indication that they are very far along or well-funded in their efforts. ESP is focused on "Risk Management," which management believes is a significant tool to assess the health of an individual's personal environment. For the industry, it provides an easily understood and standardized way of assessing risks regardless of location. The goals are three-fold and in order of priority: 1) To gain the acceptance of the residential insurance industry to a level where they will consider offering a discount to their policyholders, if their customers/insured's receive an initial CMI and then participate in the MMM Program. -14- 2) To attract the existing top tier home and moisture inspectors nationwide for them to become approved vendors of ESP as independent contractors in order to deliver the CEHI Program of services by offering a three point value statement: a. Business on-line (featuring a complete automated on-line work flow system including: sales, A/R & A/P management); b. Access to operate under ESP's CEHI liability insurance at no cost to the inspector; c. Access to group health, dental, and SEP 125 (as available). 3) To focus on turning every household in America into ESP's marketplace through environmental awareness and education, by offering allergen screening, energy use assessments, mold sampling, moisture management inspections, neighborhood environmental reports, and radon testing. a. ESP has a dedicated sales team to reach out to the 20,000 home inspectors in America who currently perform some type of environmental inspection. b. Implement ESP's national marketing campaign. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS ESP believes that the residential and commercial insurance companies can benefit materially by reducing their annual claim payouts by requiring an annually scheduled moisture and mold inspection. By having a CMI performed by CEHI from ESP to identify any existing issues, then correcting those issues, the building will then be qualified to subscribe to the MMM Program. By participating in the annual preventative MMM Program, it is possible that issues would then be caught early and not become chronic. Any required repairs can be made quickly and efficiently, usually at a lower cost. ESP mitigates the client's liability by performing the MMM Program visit annually. ESP shares in the recurring revenue with the technicians, ensuring long-term client relationships. KEY COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES STANDARDIZED, PROPRIETARY & SCALABLE PROCESSES ESP has developed a combination of standardized proprietary processes for each aspect of the client account from initial call, to the dispatch, through completion of every inspection. We have standardized each of our processes and have documented a standardized training program, which all employees and contractors must pass. New CEHIs are required to learn our processes, while developing working relationships with administrative personal at our headquarters under simulated, low-stress conditions. Teamwork is built by fostering an understanding of all aspects of the business. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR MODEL Each contractor must submit a completed vendor approval form to validate his eligibility and specifically verify the contractor's current training, certifications and equipment. Based on this verification, the contractor must then obtain the required training and equipment to operate ESP's proprietary on-line systems and to deliver the program of services. There is a fee to the contractor to receive this equipment and instruction. If the contractor has obtained certain certifications and/or equipment previously, there may be discounts to the amount of fees ESP will charge. The contractor can either purchase the sampling kit from ESP or preferably order it directly from the supplier. ESP has modeled its independent contractor payment structure after other leading service providers. The CEHI is then sub-contracted as an independent contractor and dispatched to leads as they come into the centralized call center. Once the CEHI has performed the work, the client pays ESP directly and then ESP pays the CEHI based on the standardized rate schedule. ESP has control metrics in place to manage the associated risks and expects to realize higher profit margins with greater quality work in this model. -15- DIVERSIFIED ACROSS THREE CUSTOMER SEGMENTS 1. RESIDENTIAL: The residential market is the target market, and the largest and most profitable for ESP. It represents homeowners contracting for inspections and demonstrates high same-day close rates. 2. MULTI-UNIT: This market represents condominium homeowner associations contracting for maintenance services. 3. COMMERCIAL: In this market segment, service calls are used to create a maintenance budget. These are larger contracts and have longer sales cycles. ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL REVENUE STEAMS ESP has identified complimentary revenue streams that would further support the success of our business model. Given our client database, long-term client relationships and business relationship with a client's most valued asset, his home, management believes that we can build a powerful asset through our inspection reporting database: o For each house or building on an annual MMM Program, there will be a history of inspections, remediation, repairs and maintenance. o This information could be highly valuable to mortgage and insurance underwriters, since it could mitigate their risk. Management believes that the current sub-prime crisis provides another realistic avenue for revenue for ESP. City and local governments are beginning to enforce by-laws on the holders of repossessed real estate. This means the maintenance of the property is now the obligation of the entity who has repossessed it. ESP could adapt and repackage its core services into an inspection program for the financial institutions to assist in ensuring the value of these properties. CONCLUSION ESP has assembled who management believes to be several of the upcoming industry leaders and has brought them together to address many industry concerns. Management believes that the indoor air quality industry has emerged as very important for the overall health of all people. Recognition has been given to the myriad of problems caused by poor indoor air quality as it relates to microbial infestations-mold, including allergies, asthma and other pulmonary ailments. The problem has been that the industry currently has no nationally recognized standards. In response, management believes that ESP has taken a leadership role with other industry members to create a higher level of quality education and set standards in an effort to self-regulate what has previously been an undisciplined business segment. Management believes that ESP has had the foresight to provide valuable quality services that lead to a healthier indoor environment as well as the overall health of the household. ESP has developed an array of environmental service programs and packaged them into opportunities for sale and success through its multiple lines of business. The ESP team has come together from different backgrounds, educations, experiences and qualifications. As a team, ESP has amassed many years of experience in operations, sales, marketing and finance in service-based businesses. ESP believes that its team has the knowledge and commitment to become one of the largest service providers within this rapidly growing industry. ESP's Chief Executive Officer is a senior member of various boards and committees mandated to create a consensus on present standards for education, inspection and procedures and plans for their implementation for mold and moisture within the insurance and building industries. Management believes that ESP has delivered proven inspection programs within a business model that offers significant profit, coupled with its intent to lead the industry. Management believes that ESP program participants are provided with all the tools that they need for success. ESP provides an easy to follow operations manual, complete sales program and extensive training coupled with easily accessible hygienist services. Management believes that ESP continues to be unique in client service through an established customer service center and on-line scheduling. Management believes that ESP has a focused concept, experienced management team, and a successful business program in place. Additional investment capital is required in order to implement our business model and grow the business to a national level. -16- RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the results of our operations: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, ----------------------- ---------------------------- 2007 2006 2008 2007 ---- ---- ---- ---- - ---------------------------------- ----------------------- --------------------- ----------------------- ----------------------- Net revenues $581,803 $82,319 $65,092 $245,717 Cost of Goods Sold $57,104 $15,282 $16,310 $27,333 Gross profit $524,699 $67,037 $48,782 $218,384 Operating expenses Depreciation $13,281 $3,205 $11,660 $6,071 Finance Fee $4,407,663 $- $959,863 $8,233 Consulting/Commission Fee $1,975,798 $ - $42,481 $625,035 General and administrative $ 3,262,125 $668,049 $353,539 $711,403 Total operating expenses $9,658,867 $671,254 $1,367,543 $1,350,742 Operating loss $ (9,134,168) $(604,217) $ (1,318,761) $ (1,132,358) Other Income (Expenses) Interest & Other expense $ (1,123,579) $ (17,415) $ (132,163) $ (12,587) - ---------------------------------- ----------------------- --------------------- ----------------------- ----------------------- Net Income (Loss) ($21,468,106) ($564,589) ($1,450,924) ($1,144,945) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2007 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2008 REVENUE. Total revenue for the first three months period ended March 31, 2008 decreased by $180,625 from $245,717 in the three-month period ending March 31, 2007 to $65,092 for the three months ended March 31, 2008. This decrease in revenue was a result of the delayed launching of the CEHI program. It is anticipated over the second quarter of 2008 that Safeguard will continue to increase the number of approved vendors that will be certified to deliver inspection services under the CEHI program, and that NPS will invoice and collect the annual 2008 membership dues and continue to increase new memberships in each of its associations. OPERATING EXPENSES. Operating expenses increased by $16,800, up from $1,350,742 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2007, to $1,367,542 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2008. This increase in operating expenses was the result of increased financing fees from the prior period. Expenses for the period that related to stock issuances were: finance fee $959,863 and consulting fee of $42,481. NET LOSS. Net loss increased by $305,979 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2008. This increase in net loss was the result of an increase in financing fees and interest expense. Stock issuance related expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2008 were $32,750. Currently operating costs exceed revenue because sales are not yet sufficient. We cannot assure when or if revenue will exceed operating costs. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 REVENUE. Total revenue for the period ended December 31, 2007 increased by $499,484 to $581,803 from $82,319 in the prior year. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses increased by $8,987,613, up from $671,254 in 2006, to $9,658,867 for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase in general and administrative expenses was the result of increased commissions of $1,975,798 from the prior period and increased finance fees of $4,407,663 from the prior period. NET LOSS. We cannot assure that we will generate positive revenues from its operating activities, or that we will achieve and sustain a profit during any future period, particularly if operations remain at current levels. Failure to achieve significant revenues or profitability would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred a net pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $21,468,106. This was an increase of $20,903,517 or 97% compared to the prior year. Seventy-four percent of the net pre-tax loss for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 was the result of a write down of $11,444,378 in goodwill, $4,407,663 in finance fees, and $359,218 in assets (training materials) attributable to the acquisition of Allstate Home Inspection & Household Environmental Testing, Ltd., a Delaware corporation ("AHI"). LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We had net cash of $0 at March 31, 2008, as compared to net cash of $20,866 at March 31, 2007. -17- SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS FROM MARCH 31, 2007 AS COMPARED TO MARCH 31, 2008: During the three months ended March 31, 2008, we used $510,950 of cash for operating activities, as compared to $680,731 during the three months ended March 31, 2007. The decrease in the use of cash for operating activities was a result of restructuring and optimizing the administration support after amalgamating the acquisitions made during the previous period. A portion of the funds were used to enhance the CEHI program on-line work flow system and expand the national call center to support the April 2008 launch of the CEHI program. Cash provided by financing activities relating to the issuance of promissory notes and shares of common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2008 was $510,949, as compared to $423,590 during the three months ended March 31, 2007. Since January 1, 2006, our capital needs have primarily been met from the proceeds of private placements, bridge loans and, to a lesser extent, sales. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006 AS COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2007: During the year ended December 31, 2007, ESP used $5,051,667 of cash for operating activities, as compared to $579,944 during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in the use of cash for operating activities was a result of goodwill, finance fees, accounts payable, and other general and administrative expenses. Cash provided by financing activities relating to the issuance of shares of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2007 was $2,702,308, as compared to $836,796 during the year ended December 31, 2006. Since January 1, 2007, ESP's capital needs have primarily been met from the proceeds of private placements, loans and, to a lesser extent, sales. We will have additional capital requirements during 2008 and 2009. We do not expect to be able to satisfy our cash requirements through product and service sales, and therefore we will attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of our common stock. We cannot assure that we will have sufficient capital to finance our growth and business operations or that such capital will be available on terms that are favorable to us or at all. We are currently incurring operating deficits that are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. GOING CONCERN The financial statements included in this filing have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles that contemplate the continuance of us as a going concern. Our cash flow is inadequate to pay all of the costs associated with our operations. Management intends to use borrowings and security sales to mitigate the effects of its cash position, however no assurance can be given that debt or equity financing, or financing from the exercise of warrants, if and when required will be available. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue existence. The "Going Concern Qualification" may make it substantially more difficult to raise capital. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations. The list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for management's judgment in their application. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. Note that our preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. -18- REVENUE RECOGNITION ESP recognizes service revenues in accordance with the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Revenue is recognized when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. At the inception of a customer contract for service, we make an assessment as to that customer's ability to pay for the services provided. If we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured, we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer's unpaid invoices and ceases recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received. From time to time, we may enter into contracts to sell services to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies. If we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently, we expect to record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor. We may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties. Revenue for these transactions would be recorded when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service, such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service. If these conditions are present, we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. SAFEGUARD DIVISION At time of service delivery all customers are required to sign a standard service agreement and either pay by check, credit card or if approved prior to dispatch a purchase order. The inspector will contact the centralize call center and process the check or credit card through our on-line payment processing system. This ensures immediate receipt of payment for services. Purchase orders are tracked against the applicable work order and are due within 30 days of delivery of services. Customers who request the annual inspections are required to sign a standard service agreement and a pre-authorizing form to allow the us to debit their account at time of annual inspection. We will pro-rate the revenue from those customers that sign up and prepay for multi-year annual inspections There is a non-refundable one-time charge for reviewing an inspector's application to become an approved CEHI Vendor. This amount is payable to Safeguard and is recognized upon receipt of the signed approved vendor application. NPS DIVISION Customers are required to sign a membership form and either pay for the annual dues by check or credit card at time of submission. We recognize annual membership revenue on monthly pro-rated amount from receipt of dues. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE We expect to account any share-based compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment, or SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R requires measurement of all employee share-based payments awards using a fair-value method. When a grant date for fair value is determined we will use the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model. The Black-Scholes-Merton valuation calculation requires us to make key assumptions such as future stock price volatility, expected terms, risk-free rates and dividend yield. The weighted-average expected term for stock options granted was calculated using the simplified method in accordance with the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment. The simplified method defines the expected term as the average of the contractual term and the vesting period of the stock option. We will estimate the volatility rates used as inputs to the model based on an analysis of the most similar public companies for which ESP has data. We will use judgment in selecting these companies, as well as in evaluating the available historical volatility data for these companies. SFAS No. 123R requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Annual changes in the estimated forfeiture rate may have a significant effect on share-based payments expense, as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after January 1, 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in -19- the financial statements. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. We have never paid cash dividends, and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and thus have assumed a 0% dividend yield. ESP will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term, volatility and forfeiture rate related to its stock-based awards on a prospective basis, and in incorporating these factors into the model. If our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute its stock-based compensation cost, or if different assumptions had been used, we may record too much or too little share-based compensation cost. ESP recognizes expense using the straight-line attribution method. BUSINESS GENERAL Environmental Service Professionals, Inc. (hereinafter, "we," "us," "ESP" or the "Company") is a Nevada corporation headquartered in Southern California. ESP has embarked on a strategy to acquire businesses dealing with environmental issues and resolving environmentally sensitive problems. We have completed four acquisitions and are in various stages of discussion with additional companies that we believe are a good philosophical, operational and economic fit with ESP. Of the current companies targeted, management anticipates that some will be free-standing subsidiaries and others will be absorbed into existing operations. ESP offers various inspection services that include energy/efficiency audits and for addressing mold and moisture intrusion that can have an acute and chronic negative impact on the indoor air quality of commercial and residential buildings. Environmental Safeguard Professionals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary ("Safeguard"), has developed a standardized training, certification, inspection, and results reporting analysis program which forms the foundation of a suite of services that together comprise the Certified Environmental Home Inspector ("CEHI") program. Management believes that business unit will provide the annual subscription-based moisture maintenance and energy use awareness programs to both residential and commercial clients. National Professional Services, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary ("NPS"), is currently a conglomerate of seven individual associations and maintains annual paying members. The focus of this business unit is to establish cross-training on CEHI Programs and to provide information concerning residential environmental issues, establish training for underwriters, loan officers and appraisers to educate these groups about CEHI inspection protocols. These training programs for insurance companies, underwriters, loss control and risk management personnel educate and emphasize the benefits of using a CEHI on the initial inspection and then establishing annual inspections. WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARD PROFESSIONALS, INC. OVERVIEW. Consistent with the market positioning established in ESP's initial business plan and subsequently amended in November 2007. Safeguard has developed a program that consists of a suite of services when used together comprise what management believes to be "The Industry's Best in Class Inspection." The branding of this program is called the Certified Environmental Home Inspector Program ("CEHI Program"). We believe that the CEHI Program represents the keystone for environmental services supporting the residential real-estate mortgage, banking and insurance industries in their ability to manage losses through moisture related claims. We also believe that the CEHI Program will play a significant role in managing the health and indoor air quality of the environments where people work and live. Safeguard, while developing the CEHI Program, has engaged in working relationships with five industry participants, the National Association of Moisture Management ("NAMM"), Porter Valley Software, Inc., EMLabs P&K, Environmental Data Resources Inc. ("EDR"), and CMC Energy Services, Inc. ("CMC"). By accepting NAMM's inspection protocols as the basis for the moisture inspection, EMLabs P&K's MoldScore(TM) as the prime method of sample analysis and by bringing it all together, utilizing the core of the InspectVue(TM) application from Porter Valley as the software platform, ESP has constructed a system that we believe produces a universally accepted standardized report for moisture related issues using the best science currently available to determine if any mold that may be present poses a hazard. Safeguard's CEHI Program, which includes the Certified Moisture Inspection, MoldScore(TM) analysis and the Annual Mold & Moisture Maintenance services, meets the requirements of the "mold prevention and maintenance plan ("MPMP") as defined in the "Mold Steps Toward Clarity A White Paper by the Mold Working Group Updated: July 2007" published by the Commercial Real Estate/Multifamily Finance Board of Governors ("COMBOG") Underwriting and Closing Committee of the Mortgage Bankers Association. -20- By integrating the services of EDR and CMC, management believes the CEHI Program can provide abridged Phase I environmental reports and energy use inspections. The CEHI Program is all about risk management for the individual. Management believes it is a significant tool to assess the health of one's environment. Management believes that for the industry, it provides an easily understood, standardized way of assessing the risks of their policies, regardless of location. SERVICE DESCRIPTION. The services included in the CEHI Program are comprised of what management believes to be highly advanced and standardized on-line and automated procedural protocols developed in concert with each of the four industry participants, ESP, NAMM, EMLab P&K, Porter Valley Software, EDR and CMC. It is a requirement that all CEHI's utilize the on-line system when delivering any of the CEHI Program services. By working with nationally recognized industry leaders, management believes that we have developed state of the art "best in class" procedures providing the residential real-estate and insurance industries the ability to manage losses through claim reduction. Management believes that clients utilizing CEHIs, can be assured that every single employee or approved vendor who provides services through the CEHI Program has obtained the industries' best training, certifications and equipment required to provide the CEHI's Program's services. Management believes that the CEHI Program also benefits the individual inspector. Approved vendors of Safeguard who deliver CEHI Program services are anticipated to have the ability to deliver more effective inspections and meaningful reports, as well as the ability to provide additional environmental services (e.g.: Allergen Screening, Energy/Environmental reports and Radon testing). The CEHI's ability to provide certain environmental services may be subject state or federal law and/or additional training requirements. NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, INC. OVERVIEW.

Founded in 1966, the National Association of Real Estate Appraisers ("NAREA") is a professional organization of real estate appraisers. NAREA is one of the largest professional associations in the United States. Management believes that NAREA has earned the credibility and public trust needed when affiliating with a professional organization. Management believes that the Code of Ethics and Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice ("USPAP"), to which members must adhere, provides the industry with the assurance it needs when accepting an appraisal report from a NAREA designated member. Along with the regular nationwide seminars and an annual Appraisal Expo Conference, members receive bi-monthly newsletters, appraisal guidelines, updates on regulations, the Annual Membership Directory, legislative monitoring of the issues affecting the appraisal industry and much more. The Environmental Assessment Association ("EAA") is an international organization dedicated to providing members with information and education in the environmental industry relating to environmental inspections and testing. EAA represents thousands of environmental professionals who provide services to a wide variety of clients including lenders, federal & state agencies and private companies.

The Environmental Assessment Association offers several professional designations and memberships which management believes makes the association one of the largest in the world for environmental professionals. EAA has worked closely with Environmental Protection Agencies and management believes that EAA is at the forefront of the environmental industry maintaining a well earned reputation of "being involved." Management believes that the Association of Construction Inspectors ("ACI") is the largest professional organization for those involved in construction inspection and construction project management. Management also believes that ACI is the leading association providing standards, guidelines, regulations, education, training, and professional recognition in a field that has quickly become critical for both residential and commercial construction. Management believes that members of ACI provide a vital service to the construction industry, providing both construction inspections (verifying percentage of completion for the purpose of draw requests) and construction -21- project management (providing full construction monitoring, paying of the contractor and sub-contractors, verifying each stage of construction and reporting to the client). The Housing Inspection Foundation ("HIF") is an organization of professionals dedicated to the promotion and development of Home Inspection. HIF was created to provide members with information, education, standards, ethics, and professional recognition. Management believes that the home inspection industry is the fastest growing profession today. Management believes that this creates new opportunities for those who are involved in the real estate, construction or environmental fields who are willing to learn how to perform these vital services-including home inspectors, building inspectors, real estate professionals, construction inspectors, and remodeling contractors. The International Real Estate Institute ("IREI") is a professional organization founded in 1966, making available real estate professionals to those requiring Professional Realty Reports. Management believes that IREI is one of the largest professional associations in the world, with more members in more cities than any other organization. Management believes that IREI has earned the credibility and public trust one needs when affiliating with a professional organization. Management believes that the Code of Ethics and Professional Standards of Professional Real Estate Practice, to which members must adhere, provides the industry the assurance it needs when accepting an appraisal report from an IREI designated member. Professionally presented education programs enhance the member's knowledge. Along with weekly seminars and an annual Realtor Expo and Conference, members receive bi-monthly Newsletters, real estate guidelines, updates on regulations, the Annual Membership Directory, legislative monitoring of the issues affecting the real estate industry and much more. The International Society of Meeting Planners ("ISMP") is a professional organization founded in 1966, making available professional meeting planners.

Management believes that the Code of Ethics and Uniform Standards of Professional Meeting Planners Practice, to which members must adhere, provides the industry the assurance it needs when accepting a meeting report from an ISMP designated member. Professionally presented education programs enhance the member's knowledge. In addition to the weekly seminars and an Annual Planners Expo and Conference, members receive bi-monthly Newsletters, meeting guidelines, updates on regulations, the Annual Membership Directory and legislative monitoring of the issues affecting the industry. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Establishing or acquiring strong brand identity is important to our plans to recruit the required independent contractors and establish a strong presence in local, regional and national markets. We are working with our intellectual property counsel to register a number of names for us to use in developing external brand identity. In addition, management is impressed with the number of small operators who have developed significant brand acceptance and recognition in their geographic area. We believe that these brand assets could be leveraged in much larger geographic areas with substantially larger market share. We are pursuing opportunities to expand our brand identity with such small operators having significant brand acceptance in three ways: (1) through an affiliate relationship; (2) licensing for expanded territories; and/or (3) acquisition potential, where appropriate. Currently, ESP owns the following registered trademarks/service marks: 1. Environmental Sampling Professionals, Inc(R), registration number 2721471; 2. ESP and Design(R), registration number 2788620; 3. Allstate Home Inspection & Household Environmental Testing(R), registration number 2509084; and 4. Advance Look(R), registration number 3035162. MARKETING We plan to implement multiple strategies to market our services and gain national recognition. We anticipate that our core focus will be on the residential, multi-unit, and commercial markets. The residential market is our primary the target market because we believe that it is the largest and most profitable for ESP. It represents homeowners contracting for inspections and demonstrates high same-day close rates. The multi-unit market includes condominium homeowner associations contracting for maintenance services. In the commercial market, service calls are used to create a maintenance budget. These represent larger contracts and have longer sales cycles. Management expects our diversification over several market segments to stabilize our service utilization levels during lulls in the target market. -22- We also plan to acquire small companies in different geographic regions with strong branding and operational histories within their geographical regions. We believe that we will be able to leverage these regional distribution companies into a national presence with a larger branded proprietary product line. GOVERNMENT REGULATION ESP and its affiliates are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting regulation of the indoor air quality testing industry. ESP is also subject to government laws and regulations governing health, safety, working conditions, employee relations, wrongful termination, wages, taxes and other matters applicable to businesses in general.

No officer or director is required to make any specific amount or percentage of his business time available to us. Each of our officers intends to devote such amount of his or her time to our affairs as is required or deemed appropriate by us. BOARD OF DIRECTORS Our Board of Directors currently consists of four directors. Messrs. Moyer and August are "independent" as defined in Rule 4200 of FINRA's listing standards. Mr. Torres, who is our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Watkins, who is our Chief Operating Officer and Corporate Secretary, are not independent. We plan to appoint additional independent directors so that a majority of our directors are independent. COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Our Board of Directors currently has a standing Audit Committee. We plan to establish a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee. Until such committees are established, matters otherwise addressed by such committees will be acted upon by the majority of independent directors. The following is a brief description of our committees and contemplated committees. AUDIT COMMITTEE Mr. Moyer is the sole member of our Audit Committee. Mr. Moyer meets the applicable FINRA listing standards for designation as an "Audit Committee Financial Expert." The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is authorized by the Board of Directors to review, with our independent accountants, the annual financial statements of ESP prior to publication, and to review the work of, and approve non-audit services preformed by, such independent accountants. The Audit Committee will make annual recommendations to the Board for the appointment of independent public accountants for the ensuing year. The Audit Committee will also review the effectiveness of the financial and accounting functions and the organization, operations and management of ESP. The Audit Committee was formed April, 2007. The Audit Committee held monthly meetings during fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. Pursuant to the Audit Committee charter, the functions of our Audit Committee includes: o meeting with our management periodically to consider the adequacy of our internal controls and the objectivity of our financial reporting; o engaging and pre-approving audit and non-audit services to be rendered by our independent auditors; o recommending to our Board of Directors the engagement of our independent auditors and oversight of the work of our independent auditors; o reviewing our financial statements and periodic reports and discussing the statements and reports with our management, including any significant adjustments, management judgments and estimates, new accounting policies and disagreements with management; o establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing matters; o administering and discussing with management and our independent auditors our code of ethics; and o reviewing and approving all related-party transactions in accordance with applicable listing exchange rules. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE We plan to establish a compensation committee. The functions of our compensation committee will include: o reviewing and, as it deems appropriate, recommending to our board of directors, policies, practices and procedures relating to the compensation of our directors and executive officers and the establishment and administration of certain of our employee benefit plans; o exercising authority under certain of our employee benefit plans; and -25- o reviewing and approving executive officer and director indemnification and insurance matters. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND NOMINATING COMMITTEE We plan to establish a corporate governance and nominating committee. The functions of our corporate governance and nominating committee will include: o developing and recommending to our board of directors our corporate governance guidelines; o overseeing the evaluation of our board of directors; o identifying qualified candidates to become members of our board of directors; o selecting nominees for election of directors at the next annual meeting of shareholders (or special meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected); and o selecting candidates to fill vacancies on our board of directors. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION Once established, no member of our compensation committee will serve as a member of the board of directors or the compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers who serve on our board of directors or compensation committee. No interlocking relationship exists between our board of directors and the board of directors or compensation committee of any other company, nor has any interlocking relationship existed in the past. CODE OF CONDUCT ESP has adopted a Code of Conduct that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees. The text of the Code of Conduct has been posted on ESP's Internet website and can be viewed at http://www.evsp.com. Any waiver of the provisions of the Code of Conduct for executive officers and directors may be made only by the Audit Committee and, in the case of a waiver for members of the Audit Committee, by the Board of Directors. Any such waivers will be promptly disclosed to ESP's shareholders. COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(A) OF EXCHANGE ACT Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires ESP's officers and directors, and certain persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of ESP's equity securities (collectively, "Reporting Persons"), to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership ("Section 16 Reports") with the SEC. Reporting Persons are required by the SEC to furnish ESP with copies of all Section 16 Reports they file. Based solely on its review of the copies of such Section 16 Reports received by it, or written representations received from certain Reporting Persons, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to ESP's Reporting Persons during and with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 have been complied with on a timely basis, except for the filing of Form 3s by our officers and directors. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS Under Nevada General Corporation Law and ESP's Articles of Incorporation, ESP's directors will have no personal liability to ESP's stockholders for monetary damages incurred as the result of the breach or alleged breach by a director of his "duty of care." This provision does not apply to the directors' (i) acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing and culpable violation of law, (ii) acts or omissions that a director believes to be contrary to the best interests of the corporation or its shareholders or that involve the absence of good faith on the part of the director, (iii) approval of any transaction from which a director derives an improper personal benefit, (iv) acts or omissions that show a reckless disregard for the director's duty to the corporation or its shareholders in circumstances in which the director was aware, or should have been aware, in the ordinary course of performing a director's duties, of a risk of serious injury to the corporation or its shareholders, (v) acts or omissions that constituted an unexcused pattern of inattention that amounts to an abdication of the director's duty to the corporation or its shareholders, or (vi) approval of an unlawful dividend, distribution, stock repurchase or redemption. This provision would generally absolve directors of personal liability for negligence in the performance of duties, including gross negligence. The effect of this provision in ESP's Articles of Incorporation is to eliminate the rights of ESP's stockholders (through stockholder's derivative suits on behalf of ESP) to recover monetary damages against a director for breach of his fiduciary duty of care as a director (including breaches resulting from negligent or grossly negligent behavior) except in the situations described in clauses (i) through (vi) above. This provision does not limit nor eliminate the rights of ESP or any stockholder to seek non-monetary relief such as an injunction or rescission in the event of a breach of a director's duty of care. In addition, ESP's Articles of Incorporation provide that if Nevada law is -26- amended to authorize the future elimination or limitation of the liability of a director, then the liability of the directors will be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the law, as amended. Nevada General Corporation Law grants corporations the right to indemnify their directors, officers, employees and agents in accordance with applicable law. ESP's Bylaws provide for indemnification of such persons to the full extent allowable under applicable law. These provisions will not alter the liability of the directors under federal securities laws. Furthermore, management has entered into agreements to indemnify ESP's directors and officers, in addition to the indemnification provided for in ESP's Bylaws. These agreements, among other things, indemnify ESP's directors and officers for certain expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by any such person in any action or proceeding, including any action by or in the right of ESP, arising out of such person's services as a director or officer of ESP, any subsidiary of ESP or any other company or enterprise to which the person provides services at the request of ESP. We believe that these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified directors and officers. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling ESP pursuant to the foregoing provisions, ESP has been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is therefore unenforceable. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The following table summarizes compensation paid or accrued by ESP and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2007 for services rendered in all capacities, by the chief executive officer and the other most highly compensated executive officers during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.

OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT FISCAL YEAR END None of ESP's executive officers received any equity awards during the year ended December 31, 2007. EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS ESP and its subsidiaries have not entered into any employment agreements with their executive officers to date, and do not intend to enter into employment agreements with them at the time. ESP and its subsidiaries may enter into employment agreements with them in the future. -27- EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS On or about April 28, 2008, our Board of Directors approved the 2008 ESP Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2008 Plan") for directors, officers, employees, and consultants. We anticipate that our shareholders will ratify the 2008 Plan on or before April 28, 2009. The 2008 Plan allows any of the following types of awards, to be granted alone or in tandem with other awards: (1) Stock options which may be either incentive stock options ("ISOs"), which are intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or nonstatutory stock options ("NSOs"), which are not intended to meet those requirements; (2) restricted stock which is common stock that is subject to restrictions, including a prohibition against transfer and a substantial risk of forfeiture, until the end of a "restricted period" during which the grantee must satisfy certain vesting conditions; (3) restricted stock units which entitle the grantee to receive common stock, or cash (or other property) based on the value of common stock, after a "restricted period" during which the grantee must satisfy certain vesting conditions or the restricted stock unit is forfeited; (4) stock appreciation rights which entitle the grantee to receive, with respect to a specified number of shares of common stock, any increase in the value of the shares from the date the award is granted to the date the right is exercised; and (5) other types of equity-based compensation which may include shares of common stock granted upon the achievement of performance objectives. The 2008 Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee, which will at all times be composed of two or more members of the Board of Directors who are not our employees or consultants. Any employee or director of, or consultant for, us or any of our subsidiaries or other affiliates will be eligible to receive awards under the 2008 Plan. We have reserved 10,000,000 shares of common stock for awards under the 2008 Plan. In addition, on each anniversary of the 2008 Plan's effective date on or before the fifth anniversary of the effective date, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the 2008 Plan will be increased by the lesser of (a) 5% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of the December 31 immediately preceding the anniversary, (b) 500,000 shares, or (c) a lesser number of shares of our common stock that our board, in its sole discretion, determines. In general, shares reserved for awards that lapse or are canceled will be added back to the pool of shares available for awards under the 2008 Plan. Awards under the 2008 Plan are forfeitable until they become vested. An award will become vested only if the vesting conditions set forth in the award agreement (as determined by the Compensation Committee) are satisfied. The vesting conditions may include performance of services for a specified period, achievement of performance objectives, or a combination of both. The Compensation Committee also has authority to provide for accelerated vesting upon occurrence of an event such as a change in control. The 2008 Plan specifically prohibits the Compensation Committee from repricing any stock options or stock appreciation rights. In general, awards under the 2008 Plan may not be assigned or transferred except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. However, the Compensation Committee may allow the transfer of NSOs to members of a 2008 Plan participant's immediate family or to a trust, partnership, or corporation in which the parties in interest are limited to the participant and members of the participant's immediate family. The Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee may amend, alter, suspend, or terminate the 2008 Plan at any time. If necessary to comply with any applicable law (including stock exchange rules), we will first obtain stockholder approval. Amendments, alterations, suspensions, and termination of the 2008 Plan generally may not impair a participant's (or a beneficiary's) rights under an outstanding award. However, rights may be impaired if necessary to comply with an applicable law or accounting principles (including a change in the law or accounting principles) pursuant to a written agreement with the participant. Unless it is terminated sooner, the 2008 Plan will terminate upon the earlier of April 28, 2018 or the date all shares available for issuance under the 2008 Plan have been issued and vested. In April 2008, we issued stock options to purchase 800,000 shares of our common stock at an average exercise price of $0.10 per share to our two independent directors. DIRECTOR COMPENSATION None of ESP's directors received any compensation for their respective services rendered to us during the year ended December 31, 2007. As of April 28, 2008, we approved the following non-employee director compensation program: We will pay our non-employee directors $2,500 each quarter and our two current non-employee directors will receive $10,000 in consideration for their services to ESP during 2007. In addition, we will grant options to our non-employee directors as follows: (i) each new non-employee director will receive a one-time grant of options to purchase 100,000 shares of our common stock in accordance with the 2008 Plan, (ii) each board committee chairperson will receive a one-time grant of options to purchase 50,000 shares of our common stock in accordance with the 2008 Plan, and (iii) each non-employee director will receive an annual grant of options to purchase 50,000 shares of our common stock in accordance with the 2008 Plan. -28- CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The following table sets forth certain information regarding loans made by Pro-Active Business Services, Inc. to us pursuant to promissory notes bearing simple interest at a rate of 5% per annum payable all principal and accrued but unpaid interest on or before June 30, 2008.

Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage of ownership of that person, shares of common stock subject to options held by that person that are currently exercisable or become exercisable within 60 days of May 31, 2008 are deemed outstanding even if they have not actually been exercised. Those shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. The percentage ownership of each beneficial owner is based on 50,357,879 outstanding shares of common stock. Except as otherwise listed below, the address of each person is c/o Environmental Service Professionals, Inc., 1111 East Tahquitz Canyon Way, Suite 110, Palm Springs, California 92262.

(3) Includes 500,000 shares which may be purchased pursuant to warrants that are exercisable within 60 days of May 31, 2008. Also includes 3,207,000 shares which are owned by Pro-Active Retirement Trust of which Mr. Torres is the Trustee, and 317,000 shares which may be purchased pursuant to warrants that are exercisable within 60 days of May 31, 2008 which are owned by Pro-Active Business Services, Inc. of which Mr. Torres is the President.

(5) Includes 350,000 shares which may be purchased pursuant to stock options that are exercisable within 60 days of May 31, 2008. Also includes 450,000 shares and 250,000 shares which may be purchased pursuant to warrants that are exercisable within 60 days of May 31, 2008 which are owned by S.

(7) See footnotes (2) through (5). Includes an aggregate of 2,387,000 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants and stock options that are exercisable within 60 days of May 31, 2008. (8) Includes shares subject to lock-up and vesting provisions. On November 1, 2006, ESP entered into a Redemption, Lock-up and Vesting Agreement (the "Agreement") with certain shareholders of ESP, including Edward Torres and Lyle Watkins (collectively, the "Executive"). The purpose of the agreement was to provide for redemption of a portion of their shares, and to lock-up the balance of their shares in order to facilitate ESP's ability to raise capital. According to the Agreement, in consideration for permitting ESP to redeem and lock-up the shares, ESP conferred piggyback registration rights to the shares for the Executive as the shares are released from lock-up. ESP has a right of first refusal to purchase the shares covered by the Agreement. This right specifies that before there can be any valid sale or transfer of any of the shares by the Executive, the Executive must first offer his shares to ESP. The Executive has agreed that he will not directly or indirectly sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any of the shares during the lock-up period. Furthermore, during the Executive's employment with ESP, he has agreed that he will not sell, transfer, or assign more than 8% of the released shares per month. Similarly, the Executive has also agreed that after the termination of his employment with ESP for any reason, he will not sell, transfer or assign more than 4% of the released shares per month. If, however, the Executive is terminated for cause, all unvested shares on the date of such termination will immediately be cancelled. The following table lists the number of shares subject to lock-up and the scheduled release dates: - ---------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- ------------------------- NAME OF EXECUTIVE NUMBER OF SHARES LOCK-UP PERIOD AND SUBJECT TO LOCK-UP RELEASE SCHEDULE - ---------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- ------------------------- Edward L.

The shares of common stock are to be offered by and for the respective accounts of the selling security holders. We have agreed to register all of the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") for resale by the selling security holders and to pay all of the expenses in connection with such registration and sale of the common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants, other than underwriting discounts and selling commissions and the fees and expenses of counsel and other advisors to the selling security holders. The following table sets forth, with respect to each selling security holder (i) the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned as of May 31, 2008 and prior to the offering contemplated hereby, (ii) the maximum number of shares of common stock which may be sold by the selling security holder upon the exercise of Warrants under this prospectus, and (iii) the number of shares of common stock which will be beneficially owned after the offering by the selling security holder. The selling security holders may own additional shares held in street name which are not reflected in the following table. The percentage ownership set forth below is based upon 62,760,516 shares outstanding, which includes 12,402,637 shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants. None of the selling security holders has had any material relationship with us within the past three years, except as noted in the notes to the following table. Because the selling security holders may sell all or part of their shares, no estimates can be given as to the number of shares that will be held by any selling security holder upon termination of any offering made by this prospectus. See "Plan of Distribution." Pursuant to Rule 416 under the Securities Act, the selling security holders may offer and sell shares issued with respect to the Warrants as a result of (i) stock splits, stock dividends or similar transactions and (ii) the effect of antidilution provisions contained in the Warrants.

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES COMMON STOCK The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders. The holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Accordingly, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors may elect all of the directors standing for election. Subject to preferential rights with respect to any series of preferred stock that may be issued, holders of the common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be declared by the board of directors on the common stock out of funds legally available therefore and, in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, are entitled to share equally and ratably in all of our remaining assets and funds. PREFERRED STOCK The Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences, sinking fund terms and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of such series, without further vote or action by stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. The issuance of preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of ESP. STOCK AND INCENTIVE PLANS On or about April 28, 2008, the Board of Directors of ESP approved the 2008 ESP Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2008 Plan") for directors, officers, employees, and consultants to ESP. We anticipate that our shareholders will ratify the 2008 on or before April 28, 2009. As of May 31, 2008, we had outstanding options under the 2008 Plan to purchase approximately 400,000 shares of our common stock, with a weighted average exercise price of $0.10 per share.

EFFECT OF THE CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS CODE The California Corporations Code includes provisions designed to apply certain aspects of California law to corporations organized outside California where, in general, such corporations are doing more than 50% of their business in California and have more than 50% of their outstanding voting securities held of record by persons residing in California (the "California Test"). These provisions, which are generally more restrictive than their counterparts under Nevada law, currently apply to ESP. Among the provisions of the California law which will apply are limitations on corporate dividends and other distributions and rights of stockholders to cumulate votes in the election of directors. Numerous other provisions which are listed in Section 2115 of the California General Corporation Law could also apply. In some cases, these provisions are in conflict with the laws of Nevada. The following summarizes some of the principal differences which could apply to ESP: Under both Nevada and California law, cumulative voting for the election of directors is permitted. However, under Nevada law cumulative voting must be expressly authorized in the Certificate of Incorporation. Both Nevada and California law allow a classified Board of Directors, however, Nevada law requires that it be authorized in the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws. California law does not permit staggered classes for smaller corporations, such as ESP, and directors must be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders. Under Nevada law, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws may limit the removal of directors for cause only, while under California law, stockholders may remove directors without cause. Pursuant to Nevada law, the directors may amend the Bylaws to change the number of authorized directors. Under California law, subject to limited circumstances, any amendment to the Bylaws changing the number of authorized directors requires stockholder approval. Under Nevada law, a director is obligated to discharge his or her duties in good faith and to inform himself or herself about all material information reasonably available to him or her before making a business decision. Pursuant to California law, a director is obligated to discharge his or her duties in good faith, and to exercise such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a similar position would use under similar circumstances. Whereas California law specifically prohibits a corporation from limiting or eliminating a director's liability for reckless disregard or abdication of these duties, Nevada Law contains no such prohibition. California law also requires stockholder approval for certain sale-of-assets and stock-for-stock reorganizations, whereas Nevada law does not require such approval. Nevada law permits the payment of dividends from paid-in and earned surplus or redemption of shares from earned, paid-in or reduction surplus. Under California law, any such distributions cannot be made unless retained earnings equals or exceeds the amount of the distributions, if, after giving effect to the distribution, the corporation's tangible assets are less than 125% of its liabilities, the corporation's current liabilities exceed its current assets, the corporation's average operating income for the two most recently completed fiscal years is less than 125% of its current liabilities, or the corporation would be unable to meet its liabilities as they mature. At such time as ESP has any class of securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, or approved for inclusion on the Nasdaq National Market System, and ESP has at least 800 holders of its equity securities, or ESP no longer satisfies each of the elements of the California Test, we will be exempt from the provisions of Section 2115. No assurance can be given that ESP will ever satisfy any exemption from Section 2115. LISTING Our shares of common stock are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and trade under the ticker symbol "EVSP." TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Corporate Stock Transfer, Inc., 3200 Cherry Creek Drive South, Suite 430, Denver, Colorado 80209, telephone (303) 282-4800. -35- PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION The shares of common stock offered hereby may be sold from time to time by the selling security holders for their own accounts. We will receive none of the proceeds from this offering. We will bear substantially all costs and expenses incident to the offering and sale of the shares to the public, including legal fees and disbursements of counsel, "blue sky" expenses, accounting fees and filing fees, but excluding any brokerage commissions, discounts or similar charges. Resale of the shares by the selling security holders are not subject to any underwriting agreement. The shares of common stock covered by this prospectus may be sold by the selling security holders or by their permitted pledgees, donees, transferees, beneficiaries, distributees or successors-in-interest selling shares received after the date of this prospectus from a selling stockholder as a gift, pledge, partnership distribution or other non-sale related transfer. In addition, certain of the selling security holders are corporations or partnerships which may, in the future, distribute their shares to their stockholders or partners, respectively. Those shares may later be sold by those stockholders or partners. The selling security holders will act independently of us in making decisions with respect to the timing, manner and size of each sale. The shares offered by each selling stockholder may be sold from time to time: o at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, o at prices relating to such prevailing market prices, or o at negotiated prices. Such sales may be effected in the over-the-counter market, on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or on any exchange on which the shares may then be listed. We will supply the selling security holders with reasonable quantities of this prospectus. The shares may be sold by one or more of the following: o one or more block trades in which a broker or dealer so engaged will attempt to sell all or a portion of the shares held by the selling security holders as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; o purchases by a broker or dealer as principal and resale by such broker or dealer for its account pursuant to this prospectus; o ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker solicits purchasers; o in negotiated transactions; and o through other means. To the extent permitted by law, the selling security holders may enter into hedging transactions when selling the shares. For example, the selling security holders may: o sell shares short and redeliver such shares to close out their short positions; o enter into transactions involving short sales by the brokers or dealers; o enter into option or other types of transactions that require the selling security holders to deliver shares to a broker or dealer, who then resells or transfer the shares under this prospectus; or o loan or pledge the shares to a broker or dealer, who may sell the loaned shares or, in the event of default, sell the pledged shares. There is no assurance that any of the selling security holders will sell any or all of the shares offered by them. The selling security holders may effect sales through customary brokerage channels, either through broker-dealers acting as agents or brokers, or through broker-dealers acting as principals, who may then resell the shares, or at private sales or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. The selling security holders may effect such transactions by selling shares to or through broker-dealers, and such broker-dealers may receive compensation in the form of underwriting discounts, concessions, commissions or fees from the selling security holders and/or purchasers of the shares for whom such broker-dealers may act as agent or to whom they sell as principal, or both (which compensation to a particular broker-dealer might be in excess of customary commissions). The selling security holders may further agree to indemnify any broker-dealer or agent against certain liabilities related to the selling of the common stock, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933. Any broker-dealers that participate with the selling security holders in the distribution of the shares may be deemed to be underwriters, and any commissions received by them and any profit on the resale of the shares positioned by them might be deemed to be underwriting compensation, within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, in connection with such sales. To the extent required, this prospectus may be amended or supplemented from time to time to describe a specific plan of distribution. Any shares covered by the prospectus that qualify for resale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be sold under Rule 144 rather than pursuant to this prospectus. In addition to selling the shares -36- of common stock, the selling security holders may transfer the shares by gift, distribution or other transfer not involving market makers or established trading markets. LEGAL MATTERS The validity of the issuance of the shares of common stock covered by this prospectus will be passed upon for us by Richardson & Associates, special counsel to ESP. EXPERTS Our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006 included in this prospectus and elsewhere in the registration statement have been audited by Chang G. Park, CPA, PH. D., Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm., independent registered public accounting firm, as indicated in their report with respect thereto, and are included herein in reliance upon the authority of said firm as experts in auditing and accounting in giving said reports. Our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007 included in this prospectus and elsewhere in the registration statement have been audited by Stan J.H. Lee, CPA., independent registered public accounting firm, as indicated in their report with respect thereto, and are included herein in reliance upon the authority of said firm as experts in auditing and accounting in giving said reports. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTANTS On April 28, 2008, we engaged Stan J.H. Lee, CPA, CMA ("New Accountant") to audit and review our financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2007. The New Accountant has been engaged for general audit and review services and not because of any particular transaction or accounting principle, to replace our former accountant, Chang G. Park, CPA, Ph. D. (the "Former Accountant"). Prior to engaging the New Accountant, we had not consulted the New Accountant regarding the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, completed or proposed, the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements or a reportable event, nor did we consult with the New Accountant regarding any disagreements with our prior auditor on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of the prior auditor, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports. The Former Accountant was not re-engaged effective April 28, 2008. The Former Accountant's reports on our financial statements during its past two fiscal years did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except for a going concern qualification contained in its audit reports for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006. The going concern qualification stated as follows: "The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company's losses from operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty." The decision to change accountants, which involved dismissing the Former Accountant and engaging the New Accountant, was recommended by our Audit Committee Chairperson and approved by our Board of Directors on April 28, 2008.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Environmental Service Professionals, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the year ended at December 31, 2007. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Environmental Service Professionals, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's losses from operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ Stan J.H. Lee, CPA, CMA STAN J.H.

F-11 ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICE PROFESSIONALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006 NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) H. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48") which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute, as well as criteria for subsequently recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions for financial statement purposes. FIN 48 also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes assets and liabilities. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is required to be recognized as a change in accounting principle through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - including an amendment of FAS 115". This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement. NOTE 3.

INCOME TAXES Income taxes are provided in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109), Accounting for Income Taxes. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2007 the Company has significant operating and capital losses carry forward. The tax benefits resulting for the purposes have been estimated as follows: DECEMBER 31, DECEMBER 31, 2007 2006 --------------- --------------- Accumulated deficit as of: $ (21,468,106) $ (2,557,413) Gross income tax benefit 7,513,837 869,520 Valuation allowance (7,513,837) (869,520) --------------- --------------- Net income tax benefit $ - $ - =============== =============== F-19 ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICE PROFESSIONALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006 NOTE 14. INCOME TAXES - CONTINUED The net operating loss expires twenty years from the date the loss was incurred. The retained earning balance includes accumulated comprehensive income (loss). In accordance with SFAS 109 paragraph 18 the Company has reduced its deferred tax benefit asset by a valuation allowance due to negative evidence that has caused the Company to feel it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. No portion of the valuation allowance will be allocated to reduce goodwill or other concurrent intangible asset of an acquired entity. There are no temporary differences or carryforward tax effects that would significantly affect the Companies deferred tax asset. Utilization of the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the "change in ownership" provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. None of the valuation allowance recognized was allocated to reduce goodwill or other noncurrent intangible assets of an acquired entity or directly to contribute capital. NOTE 15. GOING CONCERN The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company generated net losses of $21,468,106 during the period from September 29, 1992 (inception) through December 31, 2007. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management plans to raise additional funds through debt or equity offerings. Management has yet to decide what type of offering the Company will use or how much capital the Company will raise. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise any capital through any type of offerings. F-20 ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICE PROFESSIONALS, INC.

The Lender will have the right at any time until the Maturity Date, provided the Lender gives the Borrower written notice of the Lender's election to convert prior to any prepayment of a Note by the Borrower with respect to converting that portion of the Note covered by the prepayment, to convert all or any portion of up to 20% of the outstanding principal and accrued interest (the "Conversion Amount"), into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Borrower's common stock as is determined by dividing the F-27 ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICE PROFESSIONALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2008 NOTE 6 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS - CONTINUED Conversion Amount by fifty-eight cents ($0.58). For each share of Borrower's common stock so issued upon conversion, the Borrower will also issue to Lender one warrant to purchase one additional share of the Borrower's common stock for a purchase price of $0.75 per share for a period of three years from the date of the issuance of the warrant. On May 1, 2008 the Company entered into a short term loan for $25,000. The loan is payable all principal and a flat fee of 10% on or before June 1, 2008. The lender received 150,000 shares of common stock and 150,000 warrants to purchase 150,000 shares of the Company's common stock which are exercisable at an exercise price of $0.58 per share and expire on May 1, 2011. On May 6, 2008 the Company entered into a short term loan for $22,000. The loan is payable all principal and a flat fee of 5% on or before June 6, 2008.

ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS Under Nevada General Corporation Law and our Articles of Incorporation, our directors will have no personal liability to us or our shareholders for monetary damages incurred as the result of the breach or alleged breach by a director of his "duty of care." This provision does not apply to the directors' (i) acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing and culpable violation of law, (ii) acts or omissions that a director believes to be contrary to the best interests of the corporation or its shareholders or that involve the absence of good faith on the part of the director, (iii) approval of any transaction from which a director derives an improper personal benefit, (iv) acts or omissions that show a reckless disregard for the director's duty to the corporation of its shareholders in circumstances in which the director was aware, or should have been aware, in the ordinary course of performing a director's duties, of a risk of serious injury to the corporation or its shareholders, (v) acts or omissions that constitute an unexcused pattern of inattention that amounts to an abdication of the director's duty to the corporation or its shareholders, or (vi) approval of an unlawful dividend, distribution, stock repurchase or redemption. This provision would generally absolve directors of personal liability for negligence in the performance of duties including gross negligence. Insofar as an indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted for directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") each indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

UNDERTAKINGS The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to: (a)(1) File, during any period in which it offers or sells securities, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement; (iii) To include any additional or changed material information on the plan of distribution. (2) For determining liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement of the securities offered, and the offering of the securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering. (3) File a post-effective amendment to remove from registration any of the securities that remain unsold at the end of the offering. (4) For determining liability of the undersigned registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. (b) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction -II-4- the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. (c) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser: (1) If the registrant is relying on Rule 430B: (i) Each prospectus filed by the undersigned registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and (ii) Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by section 10(a) of the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date; or (2) If the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, Each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. -II-5- SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933,as amended, the Registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements for filing on Form S-1 and has duly caused this Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Palm Springs, State of California, on June 16, 2008.
