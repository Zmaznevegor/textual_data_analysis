There is no market price for the stock and our pricing is arbitrary with no relation to market value, liquidation value, earnings or dividends. The price was arbitrarily set at $0.50 per share, based on speculative concept unsupported by any other comparables. We have set the initial fixed price as follows: ----------------------- ------------------------------ TITLE PER SECURITY ----------------------- ------------------------------ Common Stock $0.50 ----------------------- ------------------------------ At any time after a market develops, our security holders may sell their securities at market prices or at any price in privately negotiated transactions.

ITEM 3. PROSPECTUS SUMMARY INFORMATION, RISK FACTORS AND RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES OUR COMPANY Bedrock Energy, Inc. (formerly EnviroMart.com, Inc.) ("We," "Us," "Our") was initially formed on March 17, 1999, as an Internet based distributor of environmental safety products. The Company was created through a share distribution from its parent company, General Environmental Corporation, a publicly traded entity. It was a New Hampshire corporation until 2004. In 2004, the Company reincorporated itself as a Colorado Corporation when it merged with Cell Touch, Inc. We subsequently entered into a letter of intent to acquire CellTouch Inc., a Nevada corporation. For business reasons that plan was abandoned later in that year. From 2004 to the present the business had no viable operations. The Company's name was changed to Bedrock Energy, Inc. in October 2007 to reflect its new business model. We are an oil and gas exploration and development company focused on creating a portfolio of North American assets, located in the central and Western United States that exhibit consistent, predictable, and long-lived production capabilities. We plan to build value for its shareholders through the acquisition and development of gas and oil assets that contain proven reserves in domestic areas where reserves can be economically produced at a low risk to us relying on joint venture partners to supply most of the funds needed to explore or develop these properties. We intend to participate in oil and gas prospects located in the states of Utah, Wyoming, Kansas, New Mexico, and Colorado. Our main emphasis will be to acquire production or revenue generating opportunities either by lease purchase or farmout, when available, with third parties and industry partners. We have no revenues at this time and anticipate that we will need additional capital to support the execution of our business plan. Decisions regarding future participation in acquisitions or other business development activities will be made on a case-by-case basis. We have begun initial minimal operations and are currently without revenue. We have no employees at the present time. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, two of our officers each earned fees for services rendered in the amount of $6,000 and $18,000, respectively, and these fees were recorded as accounts payable. Thus, as of April 30, 2007, we had an accounts payable balance of $84,000 or a total of $42,000 per officer. Subsequently, we issued promissory notes ("Notes") dated May 1, 2007 to each of our two officers in exchange for payment of these accounts payable as of April 30, 2007 in the amount of $42,000 for a total of $84,000 in Notes. Each of these seven percent (7%) unsecured convertible Notes, due on April 30, 2008, could be converted into shares of common stock at the rate of ten (10) shares for each dollar of principal converted. Thereafter, on September 24, 2007, our Company and the officers mutually agreed pursuant to the terms of the Notes to issue 840,000 shares of common stock in exchange for payment of the $84,000 in Notes. In addition, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we owe the officers a total of $0 and $4,430, respectively plus as of December 31, 2007, a total of $2,368 in accrued interest relative to the Notes. We are in the developmental stage of our business, and we anticipate that operations will begin in mid 2008. Our Auditors have issued a going concern opinion and the reasons noted for issuing the opinion are our lack of revenues and modest capital. Factors that make this offering highly speculative or risky are: 4 o There is no market for any securities; o We have no revenues or sales; o We are a start up company; o We have no experience in the energy exploration business as a company; o We are undercapitalized. Our executive offices are located at 8950 Scenic Pine Drive, Suite 100, Parker, Colorado 80134 and the telephone number is (303) 794-4398 and the facsimile number is (303) 794-4676. SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------- As at March 31, 2008 ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------- Total Assets $27,613 ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------- Current Liabilities $11,864 ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------- Shareholders' Equity $15,749 ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------- ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------- From March 17, 1999 to March 31, 2008 ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------- Revenues $0 ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------- Net Loss at March 31, 2008 ($355,526) ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------- As of March 31, 2008, accumulated deficit for our business was ($355,526). We anticipate that we will operate in a deficit position and continue to sustain net losses for the foreseeable future. THE OFFERING We are registering 2,525,524 shares listed for sale on behalf of selling shareholders and 500,000 shares for sale to the public on behalf of our Company. We intend to complete the sale of the 500,000 shares being offered to the public within 60 days after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, deregistering thereafter any shares remaining unsold to the public, by a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, prior to the commencement of the secondary offering on behalf of the selling shareholders. A total of $250,000 may be raised by us if all shares offered by us are sold. ================================================================ ============= Common shares Outstanding Before This Offering 2,525,524 - ---------------------------------------------------------------- ------------- Maximum common shares being offered by selling shareholders 2,525,524 - ---------------------------------------------------------------- ------------- Maximum common shares offered to public by our Company 500,000 ================================================================ ============= We are authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock. Our current shareholders, officers and directors collectively own 2,525,524 shares of restricted common stock. There is currently no public market for our shares as it is presently not traded on any market or securities exchange. 5 GLOSSARY The following are definitions of terms used in this Memorandum: BBL.

Usually one time payment made to a mineral owner as consideration for the execution of an oil and gas lease. CASING POINT. That point in time during the drilling of an oil well at which a decision is made to install well casing and to attempt to complete the well as an oil producer. COMPLETION. The procedure used in finishing and equipping an oil or gas well for production. DELAY RENTAL. Payment made to the lessor under a nonproducing oil and gas lease at the end of each year to continue the lease in force for another year during its primary term. DEVELOPMENT WELL. A well drilled to a known producing formation in a previously discovered field, usually offsetting a producing well on the same or an adjacent oil and gas lease. EXPLORATORY WELL. A well drilled either (a) in search of a new and as yet undiscovered pool of oil or gas or (b) with the hope of significantly extending the limits of a pool already developed (also known as a "wildcat well"). FARMIN. An agreement which allows a party earn a full or partial working interest (also known as an "earned working interest") in an oil and gas lease in return for providing exploration or development funds. FARMOUT. An agreement whereby the owner of the leasehold or working interest agrees to assign a portion of his interest in certain acreage subject to the drilling of one or more specific wells or other performance by the assignee as a condition of the assignment. Under a farmout, the owner of the leasehold or working interest may retain some interest such as an overriding royalty interest, an oil and gas payment, offset acreage or other type of interest. GROSS ACRE. An acre in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross acres is the total number of acres in which an interest is owned (see "Net Acre" below). GROSS WELL. A well in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned. LANDOWNER ROYALTY. That interest retained by the holder of a mineral interest upon the execution of an oil and gas lease which usually ranges from 1/8 to 1/4 of all gross revenues from oil and gas production unencumbered with an expenses of operation, development or maintenance. LEASES. Full or partial interests in oil or gas properties authorizing the owner of the lease to drill for, produce and sell oil and gas upon payment of rental, bonus, royalty or any of them. Leases generally are acquired from private landowners (fee leases) and from federal and state governments on acreage held by them. LEASE PLAY. A term used to describe lease acquisition activity in a prospect or geologically defined area. MCF. An abbreviation for "1,000 cubic feet," which is a unit of measurement of volume for natural gas. 6 NET WELL OR ACRE. A net well or acre exists when the sum of the fractional ownership working interests in gross wells or acres equals one. The number of net wells or acres is the sum of the factional working interests owned in gross wells or acres expressed as whole number and fractions thereof. NET REVENUE INTEREST. The fractional undivided interest in the oil or gas or in the revenues from the sale of oil or gas attributable to a particular working interest after reduction for a proportionate share of landowner's royalty interest and overriding royalty interest. OVERRIDING ROYALTY. An interest in the gross revenues or production over and above the landowner's royalty carved out of the working interest and also unencumbered with any expenses of operation, development or maintenance. PAYOUT. The point in time when the cumulative total of gross income from the production of oil and gas from a given well (and any proceeds from the sale of such well) equals the cumulative total cost and expenses of acquiring, drilling, completing and operating such well, including tangible and intangible drilling and completion costs. PROSPECT. A geological area which is believed to have the potential for oil or gas production. PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES. The reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Such reserves include the reserves which are expected to be produced from the existing completion interval(s) now open for production in existing wells and in addition to those reserves which exist behind the casing (pipe) of existing wells, or at minor depths below the present bottom of such wells, which are expected to be produced through these wells in the predictable future where the cost of making such oil and gas available for production is relatively small compared to the cost of drilling a new well. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. Proved reserves which are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for a recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those drilling tracts offsetting productive units which are reasonable certain of production when drilled. Proved reserves for other undrilled tracts are claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation. REVERSIONARY INTEREST. The portion of the working interest in an oil and gas lease which will be returned to its former owner when payout occurs or after a predetermined amount of production and income has been produced. UNDEVELOPED LEASEHOLD ACREAGE. Leased acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas. WORKING INTEREST. An interest in an oil and gas lease entitling the holder at its expense to conduct drilling and production operations on the leased property and to receive the net revenues attributable to such interest, after deducting the landowner's royalty, any overriding royalties, production costs, taxes and other costs. OUR COMPANY RISK FACTORS Our securities, as offered hereby, are highly speculative and should be purchased only by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment in us. Each prospective investor should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as all other information set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, before purchasing any of the shares of our common stock. 7 OUR BUSINESS IS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND UNPROVEN AND THEREFORE RISKY. We have only very recently adopted the business plan described herein-above. Potential investors should be made aware of the risk and difficulties encountered by a new enterprise in the energy business, especially in view of the intense competition from existing businesses in the industry. WE HAVE A LACK OF REVENUE HISTORY AND INVESTORS CANNOT VIEW OUR PAST PERFORMANCE SINCE WE ARE A START-UP COMPANY. We were formed on March 17, 1999 for the purpose of engaging in any lawful business and have adopted a plan to engage the acquisition, exploration, and if warranted, development of natural resource properties. We have had no revenues in the last five years. We are not profitable and the business effort is considered to be in an early development stage. We must be regarded as a new or development venture with all of the unforeseen costs, expenses, problems, risks and difficulties to which such ventures are subject. WE CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCE OF SUCCESS OR PROFITABILITY TO OUR INVESTORS. There is no assurance that we will ever operate profitably. There is no assurance that we will generate revenues or profits, or that the market price of our common stock will be increased thereby. WE MAY HAVE A SHORTAGE OF WORKING CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE WHICH COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR ABILITY TO CARRY OUT OUR BUSINESS PLAN. Our capital needs consist primarily of expenses related to geological evaluation, general and administrative and potential exploration participation and could exceed $250,000 in the next twelve months. Such funds are not currently committed, and we have cash as of the date of this Registration Statement of approximately $28,481. We have no operating history and no revenues and it may be unlikely that we will raise that additional working capital from this Registration. OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS MAY HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WHICH MAY NOT BE RESOLVED FAVORABLY TO US. Certain conflicts of interest may exist between us and our officers and directors. Our Officers and Directors have other business interests to which they devote their attention and may be expected to continue to do so although management time should be devoted to our business. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise that can be resolved only through exercise of such judgment as is consistent with fiduciary duties to us. See "Directors and Executive Officers" (page 56), and "Conflicts of Interest" (page 57). Our officers are spending part-time in this business - up to 15 hours per week. WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR WHICH WE HAVE NO COMMITMENTS, AND THIS MAY JEOPARDIZE EXECUTION OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN. We have limited funds, and such funds may not be adequate to carryout the business plan in the energy business. Our ultimate success depends upon our ability to raise additional capital. We have not investigated the availability, source, or terms that might govern the acquisition of additional capital and will not do so until it determines a need for additional financing. If we need additional capital, we have no assurance that funds will be available from any source or, if available, that they can be obtained on terms acceptable to us. If not available, our operations will be limited to those that can be financed with our modest capital. 8 WE MAY IN THE FUTURE ISSUE MORE SHARES WHICH COULD CAUSE A LOSS OF CONTROL BY OUR PRESENT MANAGEMENT AND CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS. We may issue further shares as consideration for the cash or assets or services out of our authorized but unissued common stock that would, upon issuance, represent a majority of the voting power and equity of our Company. The result of such an issuance would be those new stockholders and management would control our Company, and persons unknown could replace our management at this time. Such an occurrence would result in a greatly reduced percentage of ownership of our Company by our current shareholders, which could present significant risks to investors. WE HAVE A MINIMAL OPERATING HISTORY, SO INVESTORS HAVE NO WAY TO GAUGE OUR LONG TERM PERFORMANCE. We were formed on March 17, 1999, and only recently adopted a business plan in the energy industry. As evidenced by the financial reports we have had no revenue. We must be regarded as a new or development venture with all of the unforeseen costs, expenses, problems, and difficulties to which such ventures are subject. Our venture must be considered highly speculative. WE ARE NOT DIVERSIFIED AND WE WILL BE DEPENDENT ON ONLY ONE BUSINESS. Because of the limited financial resources that we have, it is unlikely that we will be able to diversify our operations. Our probable inability to diversify our activities into more than one area will subject us to economic fluctuations within the energy industry and therefore increase the risks associated with our operations due to lack of diversification. WE WILL DEPEND UPON MANAGEMENT BUT WE WILL HAVE LIMITED PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT. We currently have two individuals who are serving as our officers and directors for up to 15 hours per week each on a part-time basis. Our directors are also acting as our officers. We will be heavily dependent upon their skills, talents, and abilities, as well as several consultants to us, to implement our business plan, and may, from time to time, find that the inability of the officers, directors and consultants to devote their full-time attention to our business results in a delay in progress toward implementing our business plan. Once we receive the proceeds from this offering, other consultants may be employed on a part-time basis under a contract to be determined. See "Management." Because investors will not be able to manage our business, they should critically assess all of the information concerning our officers and directors. OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE NOT EMPLOYED FULL-TIME BY US WHICH COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE BUSINESS. Our directors and officers are, or may become, in their individual capacities, officers, directors, controlling shareholder and/or partners of other entities engaged in a variety of businesses. Thus, our officers and directors may have potential conflicts including their time and efforts involved in participation with other business entities. Each officer and director of our business is engaged in business activities outside of our business, and the amount of time they devote as Officers and Directors to our business will be up to 15 hours per week. As such time as the Company is financially capable of paying salaries, it is anticipated that management will assume full time roles in the Company's operations. (See "Executive Team") We do not know of any reason other than outside business interests that would prevent them from devoting full-time to our Company, when the business may demand such full-time participation. 9 OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS MAY HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS AS TO CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE OR ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN. Presently there is no requirement contained in our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, or minutes which requires officers and directors of our business to disclose to us business opportunities which come to their attention. Our officers and directors do, however, have a fiduciary duty of loyalty to us to disclose to us any business opportunities which come to their attention, in their capacity as an officer and/or director or otherwise. Excluded from this duty would be opportunities which the person learns about through his involvement as an officer and director of another company. We have no intention of merging with or acquiring business opportunity from any affiliate or officer or director. (See "Conflicts of Interest" at page 57) RISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS Any person or entity contemplating an investment in the securities offered hereby should be aware of the high risks involved and the hazards inherent therein. Specifically, the investor should consider, among others, the following risks: OUR BUSINESS, THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS, HAS NUMEROUS RISKS WHICH COULD RENDER US UNSUCCESSFUL. The search for new oil and gas reserves frequently results in unprofitable efforts, not only from dry holes, but also from wells which, though productive, will not produce oil or gas in sufficient quantities to return a profit on the costs incurred. There is no assurance we will find or produce oil or gas from any of the undeveloped acreage farmed out to us or which may be acquired by us, nor are there any assurances that if we ever obtain any production it will be profitable. (See "Business and Properties") WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITORS WHO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER US IN RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT. We are and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the oil and gas business. Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than us and, consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying and developing or exploring suitable prospects. Competitors resources could overwhelm our restricted efforts to acquire and explore oil and gas prospects and cause failure of our business plan. WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE MARKET FORCES IN THE ENERGY BUSINESS, MANY OF WHICH COULD POSE A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO OUR OPERATIONS. The marketing of natural gas and oil which may be produced by our prospects will be affected by a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include the extent of the supply of oil or gas in the market, the availability of competitive fuels, crude oil imports, the world-wide political situation, price regulation, and other factors. Recently, there have been dramatic fluctuations in oil prices. Any significant decrease in the market prices of oil and gas could materially affect our profitability of oil and gas activities. There generally are only a limited number of gas transmission companies with existing pipelines in the vicinity of a gas well or wells. In the event that producing gas properties are not subject to purchase contracts or that any such contracts terminate and other parties do not purchase our gas production, there is assurance that we will be able to enter into purchase contracts with any transmission companies or other purchasers of natural gas and there can be no assurance regarding the price which such purchasers would be willing to pay for such gas. There may, on occasion, be an oversupply of gas in the marketplace or in pipelines, the extent and duration may affect prices adversely. Such oversupply may result in reductions of purchases and prices paid to producers by principal gas pipeline purchasers. (See "Our Business and Competition, Markets, Regulation and Taxation.") 10 OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT WEATHER INTERRUPTIONS. Our activities may be subject to periodic interruptions due to weather conditions. Weather-imposed restrictions during certain times of the year on roads accessing properties could adversely affect our ability to benefit from production on such properties or could increase the costs of drilling new wells because of delays. WE WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FINANCING REQUIREMENTS TO FUND OUR FUTURE ACTIVITIES. If we find oil and gas reserves to exist on a prospect we will need substantial additional financing to fund the necessary exploration and development work. Furthermore, if the results of that exploration and development work are successful, we will need substantial additional funds for continued development. We will not have sufficient proceeds from this offering to conduct such work and, therefore, we will need to obtain the necessary funds either through debt or equity financing, some form of cost-sharing arrangement with others, or the sale of all or part of the property. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any financing. These various financing alternatives may dilute the interest of our shareholders and/or reduce our interest in the properties. (See "Use of Proceeds" and "Our Business") WE WILL HAVE WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NO FUNDING COMMITMENTS. Our working capital needs of consist primarily of: lease acquisitions, geological data acquisition and interpretation, title examination activities and administration and are estimated to total over $250,000 in the next twelve months, none of which funds are committed. We have only minimal cash as of the date of this prospectus. WE ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT OPERATING HAZARDS AND UNINSURED RISK IN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY. Our proposed operations will be subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to exploring, drilling for and producing oil and gas, such as encountering unusual or unexpected formations and pressures, blowouts, environmental pollution and personal injury. We will maintain general liability insurance but we have not obtained insurance against such things as blowouts and pollution risks because of the prohibitive expense. Should we sustain an uninsured loss or liability, or a loss in excess of policy limits, our ability to operate may be materially adversely affected. WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS AND CHANGES THEREIN WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT US. Federal income tax laws are of particular significance to the oil and gas industry in which we intend to engage. Legislation has eroded various benefits of oil and gas producers and subsequent legislation could continue this trend. Congress is continually considering proposals with respect to Federal income taxation which could have a material adverse effect on our future operations and on our ability to obtain risk capital which our industry has traditionally attracted from taxpayers in high tax brackets. WE ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION IN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT US. The production and sale of oil and gas are subject to regulation by state and federal authorities, the spacing of wells and the prevention of waste. There are both federal and state laws regarding environmental controls which may necessitate significant capital outlays, resulting in extended delays, materially affect our earnings potential and cause material changes in the in our proposed business. We cannot predict what legislation, if any, may be passed by Congress or state legislatures in the future, or the effect of such legislation, if any, on us. Such regulations may have a significant affect on our operating results. WE BELIEVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER CERTAIN NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF OUR PROPOSED OPERATIONS. Dry Holes: We may expend substantial funds acquiring and potentially participating in exploring properties which we later determine not to be productive. All funds so expended will be a total loss to us. 11 Technical Assistance: We will find it necessary to employ technical assistance in the operation of our business. As of the date of this Prospectus, we have not contracted for any technical assistance. When we need it such assistance is likely to be available at compensation levels we would be able to pay. Uncertainty of Title: We will attempt to acquire leases or interests in leases by option, lease, farmout or by purchase. The validity of title to oil and gas property depends upon numerous circumstances and factual matters (many of which are not discoverable of record or by other readily available means) and is subject to many uncertainties of existing law and our application. We intend to obtain an oil and gas attorney's opinion of valid title before any significant expenditure upon a lease. Government Regulations: The area of exploration of natural resources has become significantly regulated by state and federal governmental agencies, and such regulation could have an adverse effect on our operations. Compliance with statutes and regulations governing the oil and gas industry could significantly increase the capital expenditures necessary to develop our prospects. Nature of our Business: Our business is highly speculative, involves the commitment of high-risk capital, and exposes us to potentially substantial losses. In addition, we will be in direct competition with other organizations which are significantly better financed and staffed than we are. General Economic and Other Conditions: Our business may be adversely affected from time to time by such matters as changes in general economic, industrial and international conditions; changes in taxes; oil and gas prices and costs; excess supplies and other factors of a general nature. WE WILL EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FOR SUPPLIES IN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY. We will be required to compete with a large number of entities which are larger, have greater resources and more extensive operating histories than we do. Shortages of supplies may result from this competition and will lead to increased costs and delays in operations which will have a material adverse effect on us. WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO MANY FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. The acquisition, exploration, development, production and sale of oil and gas are subject to many factors which are outside our control. These factors include general economic conditions, proximities to pipelines, oil import quotas, supply and price of other fuels and the regulation of transportation by federal and state governmental authorities. We anticipate substantial competition in our effort to explore oil and gas properties and may have difficulty in putting together drilling participants and getting prospects drilled and explored. Established companies have an advantage over us because of substantially greater resources to devote to property acquisition and to obtain drilling rigs, equipment and personnel. If we are unable to compete for capital, participation and drilling rigs, equipment and personnel, our business will be adversely affected. WE HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AS IS PROVIDED BY COLORADO STATUTE. Colorado Statutes provide for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees, and agents, under certain circumstances, against attorney's fees and other expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with or on activities our behalf. We will also bear the expenses of such litigation for any of our directors, officers, employees, or agents, upon such person's promise to repay us therefore if it is ultimately determined that any such person shall not have been entitled to indemnification. This indemnification policy could result in substantial expenditures by us that we will be unable to recoup. 12 OUR DIRECTORS' LIABILITY TO US AND SHAREHOLDERS IS LIMITED Colorado Revised Statutes exclude personal liability of our directors and our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty except in certain specified circumstances. Accordingly, we will have a much more limited right of action against our directors than otherwise would be the case. This provision does not affect the liability of any director under federal or applicable state securities laws. WE MAY DEPEND UPON OUTSIDE ADVISORS, WHO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON REASONABLE TERMS AND AS NEEDED. To supplement the business experience of our officers and directors, we may be required to employ accountants, technical experts, appraisers, attorneys, or other consultants or advisors. Our Board without any input from stockholders will make the selection of any such advisors. Furthermore, we anticipate that such persons will be engaged on an "as needed" basis without a continuing fiduciary or other obligation to us. In the event we consider it necessary to hire outside advisors, we may elect to hire persons who are affiliates, if they are able to provide the required services. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR STOCK THE REGULATION OF PENNY STOCKS BY SEC AND FINRA MAY DISCOURAGE THE TRADABILITY OF OUR SECURITIES. We are a "penny stock" company. None of our securities currently trade in any market and, if ever available for trading, will be subject to a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that imposes special sales practice requirements upon broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers or accredited investors. For purposes of the rule, the phrase "accredited investors" means, in general terms, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000, or individuals having a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or having an annual income that exceeds $200,000 (or that, when combined with a spouse's income, exceeds $300,000). For transactions covered by the rule, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Effectively, this discourages broker-dealers from executing trades in penny stocks. Consequently, the rule will affect the ability of purchasers in this offering to sell their securities in any market that might develop therefore because it imposes additional regulatory burdens on penny stock transactions. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a number of rules to regulate "penny stocks". Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Because our securities constitute "penny stocks" within the meaning of the rules, the rules would apply to us and to our securities. The rules will further affect the ability of owners of shares to sell our securities in any market that might develop for them because it imposes additional regulatory burdens on penny stock transactions. Shareholders should be aware that, according to Securities and Exchange Commission, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) "boiler room" practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired consequent investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. 13 WE WILL PAY NO FORESEEABLE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE. We have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not ever anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable future. NO PUBLIC MARKET EXISTS FOR OUR COMMON STOCK AT THIS TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OF A FUTURE MARKET. There is no public market for our common stock, and no assurance can be given that a market will develop or that a shareholder ever will be able to liquidate his investment without considerable delay, if at all. If a market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Factors such as those discussed in the "Risk Factors" section may have a significant impact upon the market price of the shares offered hereby. Due to the low price of our securities, many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in our securities. Even if a purchaser finds a broker willing to effect a transaction in our shares, the combination of brokerage commissions, state transfer taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of our shares as collateral for any loans. RULE 144 SALES IN THE FUTURE MAY HAVE A DEPRESSIVE EFFECT ON OUR STOCK PRICE. All of the outstanding shares of common stock held by our present officers, directors, and affiliate stockholders are "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As restricted Shares, these shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or under the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions from registration under the Act and as required under applicable state securities laws. We are registering all of our outstanding shares so officers, directors and affiliates will be able to sell their shares if this Registration Statement becomes effective. Rule 144 provides in essence that a person who has held restricted securities for six months, under certain conditions, may sell every three months, in brokerage transactions, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1.0% of a company's outstanding common stock or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to the sale. There is no limit on the amount of restricted securities that may be sold by a nonaffiliate after the owner has held the restricted securities for a period of two years. A sale under Rule 144 or under any other exemption from the Act, if available, or pursuant to subsequent registration of shares of common stock of present stockholders, may have a depressive effect upon the price of the common stock in any market that may develop. OUR INVESTORS MAY SUFFER FUTURE DILUTION DUE TO ISSUANCES OF SHARES FOR VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS IN THE FUTURE. There may be substantial dilution to our shareholders purchasing in this Offering as a result of future decisions of the Board to issue shares without shareholder approval for cash, services, or acquisitions. OUR STOCK WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BE THINLY TRADED AND AS A RESULT YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL AT OR NEAR ASK PRICES OR AT ALL IF YOU NEED TO LIQUIDATE YOUR SHARES. The shares of our common stock, if listed, may be thinly-traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven, early stage company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of any of our Securities until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our Securities is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on Securities price. We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common Securities will develop or be sustained, or that any trading levels will be sustained. Due to these conditions, we can give investors no assurance that they will be able to sell their shares at or near ask prices or at all if they need money or otherwise desire to liquidate their securities of our Company. 14 OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE VOLATILE, WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES THE RISK THAT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR SECURITIES AT OR ABOVE THE PRICE THAT YOU MAY PAY FOR THE SECURITY. Because of the limited trading market expected to develop for our common stock and because of the possible price volatility, you may not be able to sell your shares of common stock when you desire to do so. The inability to sell your Securities in a rapidly declining market may substantially increase your risk of loss because of such illiquidity and because the price for our Securities may suffer greater declines because of our price volatility. The price of our common stock that will prevail in the market after this offering may be higher or lower than the price you may pay. Certain factors, some of which are beyond our control, that may cause our share price to fluctuate significantly include, but are not limited to the following: o Variations in our quarterly operating results; o Loss of a key relationship or failure to complete significant transactions; o Additions or departures of key personnel; and o Fluctuations in stock market price and volume. Additionally, in recent years the stock market in general, and the over-the-counter markets in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In some cases, these fluctuations are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the underlying company. These market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of those companies common stock. If we become involved in this type of litigation in the future, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could have a further negative effect on your investment in our stock. MANY OF OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WILL IN THE FUTURE BE AVAILABLE FOR RESALE. ANY SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, IF IN SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS, ARE LIKELY TO DEPRESS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES. Assuming all of the shares of common stock we are offering under this Registration Statement are sold and all of the shares of common stock held by the selling security holders registered hereby are sold, we would have 3,025,524 shares that are freely tradable. Our officers and directors are registering their shares for sale under this prospectus. Unrestricted sales of 3,025,524 shares of stock by our selling stockholders could have a huge negative impact on our share price, and the market for our shares. OUR NEW INVESTORS WILL SUFFER A DISPROPORTIONATE RISK AND THERE WILL BE IMMEDIATE DILUTION OF PURCHASERS' INVESTMENTS. Our present shareholders have acquired their securities at a cost significantly less than that which the investors purchasing pursuant to shares will pay for their stock holdings or at which future purchasers in the market may pay. Therefore, new investors will bear most of the risk of loss. Further, assuming all of the shares offered hereby are sold, of which there can be no assurance, an investment in our common stock by the purchaser will result in an immediate dilution (in excess of 95%) of the net tangible book value of the common stock from the offering price which the purchasers will have paid for their shares. OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND THE INVESTMENT IS THEREFORE RISKY. Due to the speculative nature of our business, it is probable that the investment in shares offered hereby will result in a total loss to the investor. Investors should be able to financially bear the loss of their entire investment. Investment should, therefore, be limited to that portion of discretionary funds not needed for normal living purposes or for reserves for disability and retirement. 15 OUR PUBLIC INVESTORS WILL BEAR MOST OF THE BURDEN IF THE SHARES OFFERED HEREIN ARE SOLD. The financial risk of our proposed activities will be borne primarily by the public investors, who, upon purchase of the shares in this offering, will have contributed the largest portion of our capital. WE ARE NOT A REPORTING COMPANY AT THIS TIME, BUT WILL BECOME ONE DUE TO THIS REGISTRATION. There is no trading market for our common stock. We will be subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, Section 13a, after the effectiveness of this offering, pursuant to Section 15d of the Securities Act and we intend to be registered under Section 12(g). As a result, shareholders will have access to the information required to be reported by publicly held companies under the Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder. We intend to provide our shareholders with quarterly unaudited reports and annual reports containing financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles audited by independent certified public accountants and intend to register under the Securities Exchange Act, Section 12(g). OUR PRESENT AND FUTURE SHAREHOLDERS WILL SUFFER DILUTION BY SALE OF THIS OFFERING AND BY NEW ISSUANCES IN THE FUTURE WHICH MAY OCCUR. Upon the sales of Shares, there may be substantial dilution to our Security holders. The sale price of our shares is substantially higher than the pro forma current net tangible book value per share of our outstanding common stock. The net tangible book value attributable to our shares as of December 31, 2006 was less than $.01 per share, and at December 31, 2007 was less than $.01. Net tangible book value per share of common stock is determined by dividing the number of outstanding shares of common stock into the net tangible book value attributable to our common stock, which is our total tangible assets less our total liabilities. After giving effect to possible sale of all of our shares registered herein, and after deducting the offering expenses payable, the adjusted net tangible book value attributable to our common stock will increase. This represents an immediate increase in net tangible book value per share to the holders of our existing common stock and an immediate dilution per share to shareholders purchasing shares of stock at the offering price of $0.50 per share. See "Dilution" hereinafter on page 18. - ------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------- ---------------------------------- Book Value per share Dilution - ------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------- ---------------------------------- Existing shareholders 2,525,524 shares $.01 - - ------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------- ---------------------------------- Sale of 500,000 new shares $.08 84% - ------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------- ---------------------------------- * Post offering - Assumes 100% sale to public of new shares registered, after deduction of offering costs. WE HAVE DETERMINED AN ARBITRARY OFFERING PRICE OF OUR SHARES. Our offering price of our shares has been determined arbitrarily by us with no established criteria of value. There is no direct relationship between these prices and our assets, book value, lack of earnings, shareholder's equity, or any other recognized standard of value of our business. ITEM 4. USE OF PROCEEDS Our intended use of the proceeds from our Offering of 500,000 shares to the public is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Use of Proceeds if the Maximum Amount is Sold REQUIREMENTS AND UTILIZATION OF FUNDS: We initially seek to raise approximately $250,000 during the upcoming three to six months from the sale of our Company's common shares. These monies will be used to acquire undeveloped acreage, properties with known production and for operating expenses. Phase Two funds 16 will be used for the acquisition of oil and gas properties containing proven reserves production enhancements on our existing producing properties and operating expenses. Additional capital may be raised for the acquisition of profitable, privately held exploration and production businesses. As set forth in the chart below, the estimated breakdown of the utilization of funds is as follows: TABLE 2 Bedrock Energy, Inc. - Requirements & Utilization of Funds Phase I Phase II Phase III ----------------- ----------------- ---------------- Lease Acq & Development costs $100,000 $500,000 $1,500,000 Working Capital 50,000 400,000 550,000 General & Administrative 75,000 175,000 200,000 Financing Costs 0 125,000 175,000 Audit/SEC Filing Fees 25,000 50,000 75,000 ----------------- ----------------- ---------------- Total $250,000 $1,250,000 $2,500,000 ================= ================= ================ We may change any or all of the budget categories in the execution of our business attempts in the energy industry. None of the line items is to be considered fixed or unchangeable. The total amount of the money raised from the sale of the shares we are offering will be used for the purpose of furthering our plan of operation, as detailed under the heading "PLAN OF OPERATION" below. In the event that our Offering is not fully subscribed, we anticipate using the funds raised by our Offering to pay listed categories in the order and priority set forth in "Use of Proceeds". The net proceeds of our Offering will be applied to general corporate funds. Our management will have complete discretionary control over the actual utilization of said funds and there can be no assurance as to the manner or time in which said funds will be utilized. Although we reserve the right to reallocate the funds according to changing events, we believe that the net proceeds from this Offering will be sufficient to fund our initial general and administrative capital requirements for a period of twelve months. The foregoing assumes our Offering will be fully subscribed. We can assure that we will require additional funds to carry out our business plan. The availability and terms of any future financing will depend on market and other conditions. Our use of proceeds are based upon the projections by our Management, which may also change according to unforeseen future events and market changes. If less than the maximum offering is sold, we will have inadequate working capital and funds to fund any expansion of operations. This lack of funds could and would severely limit our operations, and might render us unable to carry out our business plan with resulting business failure. ITEM 5. DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE We have no established market for our common stock. Our selling shareholders plan to sell shares at $0.50, until such time as a market develops for any of the securities and thereafter at such prices as the market may dictate from time to time. There is no market price for the stock and our pricing is arbitrary with no relation to market value, liquidation value, earnings or dividends. ----------------------- ------------------------------ TITLE PER SECURITY ----------------------- ------------------------------ Common Stock $0.50 ----------------------- ------------------------------ 17 We have arbitrarily determined our offering price for shares to be sold pursuant to this offering at $0.50. The Company is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of $.001 voting common stock. There were a total of 190,000 and 1,245,000 shares of common stock issued during the three months ended March 31, 2008 and during the year ended December 31, 2007, respectively, and, therefore, as of March 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 there are a total of 2,425,524 and 2,235,525 shares issued and outstanding, respectively. In April 2008, the Company sold 100,000 shares as part of a private placement at $0.10 per share. During the three months ended March 31, 2008, the 190,000 additional shares consisted of 100,000 shares sold as part of a private placement at $0.10 per share, 90,000 shares issued to consultants for services valued at $9,000. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the 1,245,000 additional shares were comprised of 300,000 shares sold as part of a private placement at $.10 per share, 420,000 shares issued as payment of debt in the amount of $84,000 and 525,000 shares issued to consultants for services valued at $52,500. On August 2, 2007, the Company authorized the sale in a private placement of 1,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $.05 per share under an exemption from registration provision of the Securities Act of 1933. The funds will be used to pay the costs associated with its administration and payment of professional fees to bring the Company to a fully reporting company within compliance of the Securities Act of 1933 and 1934. On October 17, 2007, the Company authorized up to a one for two reverse split of the Company's common stock. On March 31, 2008 the reverse split became effective. Financial Statements have been adjusted to reflect the reverse split. The additional major factors that were included in determining the initial sales price to our founders and private investors were the lack of liquidity since there was no present market for our stock and the high level of risk considering our lack of operating history. The share price bears no relationship to any criteria of goodwill value, asset value, market price or any other measure of value and were arbitrarily determined in the judgment of our Board of Directors. ITEM 6. DILUTION We are registering all outstanding shares as of May 27, 2008. Since our inception on March 17, 1999, our original officers and directors purchased 210,030 shares @ $.40 per share and 75,000 shares at $.20 per share. A total of 264,986 shares were distributed in 1999 as a spin-off dividend to EnviroMart shareholders. COMPARATIVE DATA The following table sets forth with respect to existing shareholders and new investors, a comparison of the number of our shares of common stock purchased the percentage ownership of such Shares, the total consideration paid, the percentage of total consideration paid and the average price per Share. All percentages are computed based upon cumulative shares and consideration assuming sale of all shares in the line item as compared to maximum in each previous line. 18 SHARES PURCHASED(1) TOTAL CONSIDERATION AVERAGE NUMBER PERCENT (2) AMOUNT PERCENT PRICE/SHARE (3) ------------------------------------------------------- 1) Existing Shareholders 2,525,524 - - - $0.15 2) New Shareholders 500,000 100% 250,000 100% $0.50 375,000 75% 187,500 75% $0.50 250,000 50% 125,000 50% $0.50 125,000 25% 62,500 25% $0.50 "Net tangible book value" is the amount that results from subtracting the total liabilities and intangible assets from the total assets of an entity. Dilution occurs because we determined the offering price based on factors other than those used in computing book value of our stock. Dilution exists because the book value of shares held by existing stockholders is lower than the offering price offered to new investors. (1) 2,525,524 shares were issued at $0.15 per share average. (2) Percentage relates to total percentage of shares sold up to such increment in the offering. (3) Percentage relates to total percentage of capital raised post offering. Following is a table detailing dilution to investors if 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% of the shares in the offering are sold. 25% 50% 75% 100% ============================================ =============== =============== ============== =============== Net tangible book value per share prior to .006 .006 .006 .006 stock sale - -------------------------------------------- --------------- --------------- -------------- --------------- Net tangible book value per share after .020 .042 .061 .080 stock sale(1) - -------------------------------------------- --------------- --------------- -------------- --------------- Average cost of shares owned by current .15 .15 .15 .15 stockholders per share - -------------------------------------------- --------------- --------------- -------------- --------------- (1) Computation of net tangible book value per share prior to stock sale includes the deduction of offering costs of $25,000. As at December 31, 2006, the net tangible book value of our stock was $(0.04) per share and at December 31, 2007 was $.003 per share. If we are successful in achieving selling shares at the exercise price, the pro forma net tangible book value of our stock after deducting the offering costs of $25,000 would be as shown in chart above. That would represent an immediate increase in net tangible book value per share and per share dilution to new investors as shown in chart above, assuming the shares are sold at the offering price of $0.50 for 500,000 shares. The book value of the stock held by our existing stockholders will increase per share, while new purchaser's book value will decrease from purchase price, as shown in chart above, to the net tangible book value. ITEM 7. SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS Most of the selling shareholders, with the exception of the officers and directors, obtained their shares of our stock as a spin-off dividend in 1999. The officers and directors who also received shares in the spin off also purchased shares as set forth on page 63 and were issued shares for services and in certain cases converted notes into common stock certain other persons purchased in a private placements in 1999 and 2000 and another private placement in 2007. 19 We are authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of $.001 voting common stock. There were a total of 1,245,000 shares of common stock issued during the year ended December 31, 2007 and, therefore, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 there are a total of 2,235,524 and 990,524 shares issued and outstanding, respectively. These additional shares were comprised of 300,000 shares sold as part of a private placement at $0.10 per share, 420,000 shares issued as payment of debt in the amount of $84,000 and 525,000 shares issued to consultants for services valued at $52,500. On August 2, 2007, we authorized the sale in a private placement of 1,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $.05 per share under an exemption from registration provision of the Securities Act of 1933. The funds will be used to pay the costs associated with its administration and payment of professional fees to bring us to a fully reporting company within compliance of the Securities Act of 1933 and 1934. On October 17, 2007, we authorized up to a one for two reverse split of our common stock. The reverse split became effective March 31, 2008. Financial Statements have been adjusted to reflect the reverse split. Other than the stock transactions discussed above, we have not entered into any transaction nor are there any proposed transactions in which any founder, director, executive officer, significant shareholder of our Company or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing had or is to have a direct or indirect material interest. No person who may, in the future, be considered a promoter of this offering, will receive or expect to receive assets, services or other considerations from us except those persons who are our salaried employees or directors.

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION Upon effectiveness of the registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part, we will conduct the sale of shares by the Company on a self-underwritten basis. After 60 days from date of effectiveness of this Registration Statement we will cease our offering of our shares by the Company and file a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to deregister any unsold shares of the Offering to the public and our selling shareholders may then commence to sell their securities in market sales, if a market ever develops hereafter. There will be no underwriters used on sales of the 500,000 shares to the public, no dealers' commissions paid on sales of the 500,000 shares to the public, and no passive market making. Our officers and directors, Edward Nichols and Herbert Sears will sell securities on our behalf in this offering. Edward Nichols and Herbert Sears are not subject to a statutory disqualification as such term is defined in Section (a)(39) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. They will rely on Rule 3a4-1 to sell our securities without registering as broker-dealers. Messrs. Nichols and Sears will not offer any of their shares for sale until the offering to the public of our shares has been closed. They are serving as our officers and directors otherwise than in connection with transactions in securities and will continue to do so at the conclusion of this offering. They have not been a broker or dealer, or an associated person of a broker or dealer, within the preceding 12 months, and have not nor will not participate in the sale of securities for any issuer more than once every twelve months. Our officers and directors will not receive commissions or other remuneration in connection with their participation in this offering based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities. We will only use this prospectus in connection with this offering and no other sales materials. There is no market for the securities at this time and our pricing is arbitrary with no relation to market value, liquidation value, earnings or dividends. Until a public market develops, we are registering our shares for sale at the following price: ----------------------- ------------------------------ TITLE PER SECURITY ----------------------- ------------------------------ Common Stock $0.50 ----------------------- ------------------------------ After effectiveness of this registration statement, at any time after a market develops, our selling shareholders may sell their securities at market prices or at any price in privately negotiated transactions. The prices for sale of shares were arbitrarily set at $0.50 per share, and bear no relationship to any quantification of value. Our selling shareholders may be deemed underwriters in this offering. Any funds from sale of shares from the company not immediately used for corporate purposes will be deposited into an interest bearing account in our name, and interest accrued on such funds will be retained by us. ITEM 9. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES The securities being registered and/or offered by this Prospectus are shares. COMMON STOCK We are presently authorized to issue two hundred million (200,000,000) shares of our common stock. A total of two million, five hundred twenty five thousand, five hundred twenty four (2,525,524) common shares are issued and outstanding as of May 27, 2008. 39 COMMON SHARES All shares are equal to each other with respect to voting, liquidation, and dividend rights. Special shareholders' meetings may be called by the officers or director, or upon the request of holders of at least one-tenth (1/10th) of the outstanding shares. Holders of shares are entitled to one vote at any shareholders' meeting for each share they own as of the record date fixed by the board of directors. There is no quorum requirement for shareholders' meetings. Therefore, a vote of the majority of the shares represented at a meeting will govern even if this is substantially less than a majority of the shares outstanding. Holders of shares are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefore, and upon liquidation are entitled to participate pro rata in a distribution of assets available for such a distribution to shareholders. There are no conversion, pre-emptive or other subscription rights or privileges with respect to any shares. Reference is made to our Articles of Incorporation and our By-Laws as well as to the applicable statutes of the State of Colorado for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of shares. It should be noted that the board of directors without notice to the shareholders may amend the By-Laws. Our shares do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more than fifty percent (50%) of the shares voting for election of directors may elect all the directors if they choose to do so. In such event, the holders of the remaining shares aggregating less than fifty percent (50%) of the shares voting for election of directors may not be able to elect any director. PREFERRED SHARES We are presently authorized to issue ten million (10,000,000) Shares of Preferred Stock, no par value per share. As of May 27, 2008 we had no shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. TRANSFER AGENT Effective upon the completion of this offering, the transfer agent for our securities is Mountain Share Transfer, Inc., 1625 Abilene, Broomfield, Colorado 80020. ITEM 10. INTEREST OF NAMED EXPERTS AND COUNSEL We have not hired or retained any experts or counsel on a contingent basis, who would receive a direct or indirect interest in us, or who is, or was, our promoter, underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer or employee. ITEM 11. INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE REGISTRANT A. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS ------------------------ HISTORY OF BEDROCK ENERGY, INC. CellTouch, Inc., now known as Bedrock Energy, Inc., was incorporated in Colorado on August 11, 2004 with its name changed to Bedrock Energy, Inc. on October 18, 2007. Enviromart.com, Inc. was incorporated in New Hampshire in March 1999. On September 21, 2004 CellTouch, Inc. and Enviromart.com, Inc. were merged under the laws of the State of Colorado and CellTouch, Inc. became the surviving entity. We have been in the development stage since our inception. Activities through December 31, 2007 include the raising of equity capital and the formation of a previous business plan to sell environmental products over the Internet as well as the current business plan to merge with or acquire and develop assets from a company in the oil and gas industry. COMPANY OVERVIEW We have been inactive during the last 5 years. We have no recent operating history and no representation is made, nor is any intended, that we will able to carry on our activities profitably. The viability of the proposed business effort is dependent upon sufficient funds being realized from this offering, of which there is no assurance. Edward Nichols, President, Chief Executive Officer and director, has prior experience in the acquisition, evaluation, exploration 40 and development of oil and gas properties. Edward Nichols and Herbert Sears devote part-time efforts to our affairs. We are an oil and gas exploration and development company focused on creating a portfolio of North American assets, located in the Central and Western United States that exhibit consistent, predictable, and long-lived production capabilities. We plan to build value for our shareholders through the acquisition and development of gas and oil assets that contain proven reserves in domestic areas where reserves can be economically produced at a low risk to the Company relying on joint venture partners to supply most of the funds needed to explore or develop these properties. Our main emphasis will be to acquire production or revenue generating opportunities either by lease purchase or farmout, when available, with third parties and industry partners. We have no revenues at this time and anticipate that we will need additional capital to support the execution of our business plan. Decisions regarding future participation in acquisitions or other business development activities will be made on a case-by-case basis. Our Goals for the next year are as follows: MILESTONES - ----------------------------------- -- ---------------------------------------- 2nd Quarter 2008 Completion of Registration Statement - ----------------------------------- -- ---------------------------------------- 3rd Quarter 2008 Closure of Registration Statement; - ----------------------------------- -- ---------------------------------------- 4th Quarter 2008 Commence revenue from operations - ----------------------------------- -- ---------------------------------------- 1st Quarter 2009 Acquire additional producing properties - ----------------------------------- -- ---------------------------------------- PLAN OF OPERATIONS: We plan to engage in the exploration, acquisition, development, production, and sale of natural gas and crude oil, although the Company expects to generate most of its initial revenue from the production and sale of natural gas. Our overall growth strategy is to continue building value in our Company through the development and acquisition of gas and oil assets that exhibit consistent, predictable, and long-lived production. Our current focus is Coal Bed Methane ("CBM") reservoirs in the Central and Western region of the United States which produce both Coal Bed Methane, and at times, conventional gas. We plan on acquiring properties that contain proven gas reserves, some of which are adjacent to interstate pipeline systems which provide ready access to sales markets for the gas produced. The major natural gas corridors in the United States and Canada are shown in Exhibit 99.1(a). Please see graphic on Exhibit 99.1(a). 41 We believe our path to success will be built around a three phase growth strategy as described below: PHASE ONE of our business plan calls for investing in various lease holdings and properties with no current production. This program is consistent with our principal strategy which is to acquire and farm-out large land positions in major oil and natural gas basins while retaining substantial carried interests. Surface geology will be reviewed along with seismic data, when available, which will aid in subsurface structural interpretation and lead generation for new acquisition opportunities in areas of interest. PHASE TWO of our business plan calls for purchasing interests in properties which contain proven reserves. This growth strategy is partially based on participation, as it intends to team up with outside strategic partners, and investors who will assume part or all of the costs associated with the drilling of additional wells in exchange for part of the revenues derived from the wells they finance. We expect that implementation of this strategy will reduce the financial risk to us while retaining an overriding net royalty interest in each successful well drilled. PHASE THREE of our business plan calls for originating, developing and managing balanced, low-risk, highly-focused developmental drilling programs, with accredited investors and qualified partners, in areas with low drilling costs and high success rates. This stage further balances our approach to profitable energy asset development through low risk, highly focused, predominantly "development" drilling projects. This business development plan is expected to be executed in multiple phases. The pace of the development will obviously depend on the availability of a viable financing program, lender restrictions, general economic conditions, and potential other factors relevant to this type of program. THE MARKET: NATURAL GAS SUPPLY AND DEMAND: We believe that the rising oil and gas prices, combined with geopolitical instability and soaring demand from burgeoning economies in China and India, have increased the intrinsic value of predictable, secure, North American reserves, and we expect this trend to continue in light of tensions in the Middle East and certain other foreign countries (e.g., Venezuela, Nigeria). The National Petroleum council estimates the U.S. demand for natural gas to increase from 22 trillion cubic feet (TCF) in 1998 to over 31 TCF by 2015. This nearly 50% increase in demand for natural gas, coupled with constrained supplies from conventional sources and storage facilities, suggests an urgent need for new gas sources. Although conventional gas sources such as high permeability sandstones supply about 60% of the U.S. demand (13 TCF in 1998), projections indicate a flat to declining supply through year 2015. The shortfall in conventional gas supply is expected to be taken up by production from un-conventional sources such as tight gas sandstones/shales, associated gas, and Coal Bed Methane (CBM). CBM shows great promise as a future source of natural gas, with the US Geological Survey estimating some 700 TCF contained in 6 major CBM basins in the continental US. This constitutes an enormous reserve, almost the entire US demand for the next 25 years. The Western Interior Basin covering portions of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri is one of those 6 major basins. The Gas Research Institute estimates CBM gas reserves in the Forrest City and Cherokee basin, the two sub-basins of the Western Interior Basin, contain approximately 7 TCF. We plan to acquire leases that lie within one or both of these sub-basins. We believe the current supply and demand fundamentals will lead to a strengthening in prices. Consequently, we intend to continually seek out potential producing properties in these regions of the U.S. Please see graphic on Exhibit 99.1(b). 42 CBM PRODUCTION: CBM production is similar to conventional natural gas production in terms of the physical production facilities and the product produced. However, surface mechanics and some production characteristics of CBM wells are quite different from traditional natural gas production wells. Methane gas is created as part of the coalification process. Coals vary in their methane gas content which is defined by the industry as cubic feet of gas per ton of coal. Conventional natural gas wells assume a porous and permeable reservoir, hydrocarbon migration and a natural structural or stratigraphic trap. However, CBM is trapped in the molecular structure of the coal itself until it is released by pressure changes, resulting from water removal from the coal-bed. Water completely permeates coal-beds and the natural fracture system or cleats as they are normally referred. In good production areas, the cleats are pervasive throughout the coal-beds. CBM gas, principally methane, is adsorbed onto the grain surfaces of the coal. To produce CBM, the water must be drawn off first, lowering the pressure so that the methane gas will desorb from the coal thus allowing gas to flow from the coal into the de-watered cleats that act as high permeable conduits to the well bore, where gas can be produced at the well head. These cleats are assumed to have been formed during the coalification and uplifting processes. If cleat permeability is adequately developed, it may allow commercial quantities of methane gas to be produced from the well. The qualities of productive CBM wells include coal quality, the content of natural gas per ton of coal, thickness of the coal-beds, reservoir pressure, existence of natural fractures, and overall permeability of the coal-bed. Please see graphic on Exhibit 99.1(c). CBM production also differs from conventional gas production that normally starts at its highest production rate and then declines with time. Because coal-beds have water residing within the cleats, the water needs to be withdrawn in order to promote production of the adsorbed gases. Thus, for the case of CBM, initial water production is high and diminishes with time. CBM gas production, however, starts at a relatively low rate, reaching a peak some months later and then begins to decline. CBM production is attractive due to several geological factors: Coal stores six or seven times as much gas as a conventional natural gas reservoir of equal rock volume due to the large internal surface area of coal; significant amounts of coal are accessible at shallow depths, making well drilling and completion relatively inexpensive; exploration costs are also low since methane occurs in coal deposits, and the location of the Nation's coal resources is well defined as indicated in the prominent Western Natural gas fields map shown to the right. Please see graphic on Exhibit 99.1(d). 43 Estimates of the in-place gas resources of the principal coal-bearing basins of the United States exceed 700 trillion cubic feet. Economically recoverable resources of coal bed gas are probably less than 100 Tcf. This represents about a five-year supply at current U.S. consumption rates. GLOBAL OIL SUPPLY AND DEMAND: World demand for oil is expected to increase by 54 percent in the first 25 years of the 21st century, according to the Energy Information Agency of the U.S. government. To meet that demand, the world's oil-producing countries will have to pump out an additional 44 million barrels of oil each and every day by 2025. Much of the growth in demand - about 40 percent will come from Asia, where demand is expected to double by 2025, thanks mainly to rapidly growing economies in China and India. In 2004, China passed Japan as the world's second-largest consumer of oil. It ate up an average of 6.63 million barrels of oil every day - about twice what it produces. Its oil imports doubled between 1999 and 2004. China's demand for oil is expected to continue to increase by five to seven percent a year. If that happens, China will surpass the United States as the world's largest consumer of oil by 2025. Similarly, India's oil needs are expected to grow by four to seven per cent a year. Up to this point, the world's oil producers have generally been able to meet demand. However, should demand increase substantially, or production decrease for any reason, there could be a significant spike in the price of oil and possible shortages. The London-based Oil Depletion Analysis Centre recently released a study that predicted tight oil supplies through the rest of this decade, even if all of the new major oil recovery projects scheduled to come on stream over the next six years meet their targets. The only way to avoid it, the study said, is for demand to drop sharply. INCREASING SUPPLY: There are two ways to increase oil supply: getting more oil out of existing wells and finding new sources. Extraction from existing wells has been getting steadily more efficient; according to The Economist, "A few decades ago, the average oil recovery rate from reservoirs was 20%; thanks to remarkable advances in technology, this has risen to about 35%," with future increases expected (19). Methods for recovering oil from shale are notable for continuing to improve. Furthermore new sources, including the ocean, continue to be opened for exploration. AREAS OF INTEREST AND PROPERTY: We will consider the following criteria when evaluating whether to acquire an oil and gas prospect: 1) Proximity to existing production; 2) Target zone is less than 4,000 feet in depth; 3) Location in a known producing region; 4) Whether there is well control data from nearby drill sites; 5) Favorable geologic evaluations by local geologists of production potential; 6) Reasonable cost of acquisition; 7) Term of lease and drilling commitment, if any; and 8) Reasonable drilling cost estimates. Upon selecting a lease for purchase, a geochemical survey of the property will be initiated. COMPETITION, MARKETS, REGULATION AND TAXATION COMPETITION: There is a large number of companies and individuals engaged in the exploration for minerals and oil and gas; accordingly, there is a high degree of competition for desirable properties. Many of the companies and individuals so engaged have substantially greater technical and financial resources than us. Most of the domestic natural gas reserves are concentrated in larger U.S. based companies. In 2005, the top twenty operators (Class 1-10 and 11-20) had sixty percent of the proven reserves of natural gas. The next two size classes contain 44 80 and 400 companies and account for 24 and 10 percent of the U.S. natural gas proved reserves, respectively. The top 20 operators had a 23 percent increase in their reserves from 200 to 2005. The rest of the operators had a three percent increase in their reserves during the same period. There were 859 active gas producing fields in 2005 and approximately 15,000 domestics oil and gas operators. Please see graphic on Exhibit 99.1(e). MARKETS: The availability of a ready market for oil and gas discovered, if any, will depend on numerous factors beyond the control of us, including the proximity and capacity of refineries, pipelines, and the effect of state regulation of production and of federal regulations of products sold in interstate commerce, and recent intrastate sales. The market price of oil and gas are volatile and beyond our control. The market for natural gas is also unsettled, and gas prices have increased dramatically in the past four years with substantial fluctuation, seasonally and annually. There generally are only a limited number of gas transmission companies with existing pipelines in the vicinity of a gas well or wells. In the event that producing gas properties are not subject to purchase contracts or that any such contracts terminate and other parties do not purchase our gas production, there is no assurance that we will be able to enter into purchase contracts with any transmission companies or other purchasers of natural gas and there can be no assurance regarding the price which such purchasers would be willing to pay for such gas. There presently exists an oversupply of gas in the certain areas of the marketplace due to pipeline capacity, the extent and duration of which is not known. Such oversupply may result in restrictions of purchases by principal gas pipeline purchasers. GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS: Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production. Our oil and natural gas exploration, production and related operations, when developed, are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state, tribal and local authorities and agencies. For example, some states in which we may operate require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Such states may also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells, and the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. Failure to comply with any such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry will most likely increase our cost of doing business and may affect our profitability. Although we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. FEDERAL REGULATION OF NATURAL GAS: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which may affect the marketing of natural gas produced by us, as well as the revenues that may be received by us for sales of such production. Since the mid-1980s, FERC has issued a series of orders, culminating in Order Nos. 636, 636-A and 636-B ("Order 636"), that have significantly altered the marketing and transportation of natural gas. Order 636 mandated a fundamental 45 restructuring of interstate pipeline sales and transportation service, including the unbundling by interstate pipelines of the sale, transportation, storage and other components of the city-gate sales services such pipelines previously performed. One of FERC's purposes in issuing the order was to increase competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit largely upheld Order 636 and the Supreme Court has declined to hear the appeal from that decision. Generally, Order 636 has eliminated or substantially reduced the interstate pipelines' traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas in favor of providing only storage and transportation service, and has substantially increased competition and volatility in natural gas markets. The price we may receive from the sale of oil and natural gas liquids will be affected by the cost of transporting products to markets. Effective January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system for transportation rates for oil pipelines, which, generally, would index such rates to inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. We are not able to predict with certainty the effect, if any, of these regulations on our intended operations. However, the regulations may increase transportation costs or reduce well head prices for oil and natural gas liquids. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS: Our operations are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. To date our compliance with these regulations has had no material effect on our operations, capital, earnings, or competitive position, and the cost of such compliance has not been material. We are unable to assess or predict at this time what effect additional regulations or legislation could have on our activities. EFFECT OF CHANGING INDUSTRY CONDITIONS ON DRILLING ACTIVITY: Lower oil and gas prices have caused a decline in drilling activity in the U.S. from time to time. However, such reduced activity has also resulted in a decline in drilling costs, lease acquisition costs and equipment costs, and an improvement in the terms under which drilling prospects are generally available. We cannot predict what oil and gas prices will be in the future and what effect those prices may have on drilling activities in general, or on its ability to generate economic drilling prospects and to raise the necessary funds with which to drill them. REGULATION AND PRICING OF NATURAL GAS:. Our operations may be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with respect to the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate and intrastate commerce. State regulatory agencies may exercise or attempt to exercise similar powers with respect to intrastate sales of gas. Because of its complexity and broad scope, the price impact of future legislation on the operation of us cannot be determined at this time. CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS PRICE AND ALLOCATION REGULATION: Pursuant to Executive Order Number 12287, issued January 28, 1981, President Reagan lifted all existing federal price and allocation controls over the sale and distribution of crude oil and natural gas liquids. Executive Order Number 12287 was made effective as of January 28, 1981, and consequently, sales of crude oil and natural gas liquids after January 27, 1981 are free from federal regulation. The price for such sales and the supplier-purchaser relationship will be determined by private contract and prevailing market conditions. As a result of this action, oil which may be sold by us will be sold at deregulated or free market prices. At various times, certain groups have advocated the reestablishment of regulations and control on the sale of domestic oil and gas. STATE REGULATIONS: Our production of oil and gas, if any, will be subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we may produce oil and gas. In general, these regulatory authorities are empowered to make and enforce regulations to prevent waste of oil and gas and to protect correlative rights and opportunities to produce oil and gas as between owners of a common reservoir. Some regulatory authorities may also regulate the amount of oil and gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production. PROPOSED LEGISLATION: A number of legislative proposals have been and probably will continue to be introduced in Congress and in the legislatures of various states, which, if enacted, would significantly affect the petroleum industries. Such proposals and executive actions involve, among other things, the imposition 46 of land use controls such as prohibiting drilling activities on certain federal and state lands in roadless wilderness areas. At present, it is impossible to predict what proposals, if any, will actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, such proposals will have. However, President Clinton's establishment of numerous National Monuments by executive order has had the effect of precluding drilling across vast areas of the Rocky Mountain West. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS: Oil and gas exploration and development are specifically subject to existing federal and state laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing, or producing oil and gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. All of our operations involving the exploration for or the production of any minerals are subject to existing laws and regulations relating to exploration procedures, safety precautions, employee health and safety, air quality standards, pollution of stream and fresh water sources, odor, noise, dust, and other environmental protection controls adopted by federal, state and local governmental authorities as well as the right of adjoining property owners. We may be required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of minerals may have upon the environment. All requirements imposed by any such authorities may be costly, time consuming, and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations. It may be anticipated that future legislation will significantly emphasize the protection of the environment, and that, as a consequence, our activities may be more closely regulated to further the cause of environmental protection. Such legislation, as well as future interpretation of existing laws, may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs to us and delays, interruptions, or a termination of operations, the extent to which cannot now be predicted. LEASING ACTIVITIES: As of March 1, 2008, we have reviewed a variety of acquisition opportunities. In the event that we are successful in Phase One of our plan, we intend to acquire mineral rights, to the extent that we believe such land will further our exploration and development activities and provide us increased value. All of the mineral leases that we have executed or plan to execute will grant it the exclusive right to explore for and develop oil, gas and other hydrocarbons and minerals that may be produced from wells drilled on the leased property without any depth restrictions. Each lease also grants us rights of way to easements for laying pipelines and servicing or drilling other wells in the vicinity of the leased property. Our lease agreements will vary both in term and price paid per acre. Some leases are for 2 year periods with extensions for 3 additional years, and others are for 10 years with extensions for additional years. Our leases will be on a paid up basis. We will agree to pay each lessor a royalty equal to approximately 12.5% of any oil, gas or other minerals that may be produced from wells drilled on their leased property. In the event of a shut-in well capable of producing oil or gas, we may agree to pay the lessor a royalty per net mineral acre. All potential lease agreements will provide that we maintain the lease with production. We will continually review our lease obligations to determine which leases we will not, or may not choose to renew. Under our leases, we will have the right to pool the leased property with other land owned or leased by it in the immediate vicinity for the production of oil or gas. With respect to shallow gas and associated hydrocarbons produced in conjunction therewith, we may have the right to pool or unitize the leased properties into a development pool of a maximum of 3,000 acres if we have drilled at least 2 wells within the pooled unit no later than 1 year after the expiration of the primary term of the lease. We will always initiate a standard due diligence process on all potential properties to be acquired, including obtaining a title or title insurance to confirm our rights to any oil, gas or other minerals produced pursuant to our leases. Our final interest in any oil, gas or other mineral that we produce may vary depending upon negotiations with the mineral owners, financers, if any, as 47 well as organizations that we may contract to perform drilling, completion and operating activities on our wells. We will seek an industry standard 100% working interest in all of our leased acreage. A "working interest" is the operating interest that gives us, as the operator, the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and a share of production. We will seek a Net Revenue Interest (NRI) of between 79.5% and 84.375% on all leased acreage. Most of our initial capital expenditures will be associated with the acquisition of oil and gas mineral leases, raising capital and administrative costs. Upon raising the required capital to pursue our lease acquisition program, our strategy will then shift towards realizing value from those expenditures through the drilling and production of the acquired properties, starting in our proven reserve areas. We intend to continue to expand our lease base, as appropriate. The rate of development will be carefully designed to blend external financing with income from existing production and other sources. GAS PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT: To reduce our exposure to unfavorable changes in natural gas prices we plan to utilize energy swaps in order to have a fixed-price contract. These contracts allow us to be able to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas prices to be received for hedged production and benefit operating cash flows and earnings when market prices are less than the fixed prices provided under the contracts. However, we will not benefit from market prices that are higher than fixed prices in contracts for hedged production. If we are unable to provide the quantity that we will have contracted for, we may need to go to the open market to purchase the required amounts that we have contracted to provide. RECENT TRANSACTION: We recently entered in a farmout agreement with Sun River Energy, Inc. on 640 acres in Hot Springs County, Wyoming. The lands covered by this agreement include Section 36, T41N, R81W, lease number 06-00256. The terms and conditions of the farm out agreement were not disclosed. EXTERNAL GROWTH STRATEGY: Oil and gas production companies are subject to international competition, particularly as businesses in this industry becomes more global in nature. As a result of these and other factors affecting industry today, such as deregulation, capital market intervention, and new developments in recovery technologies, small businesses and large corporations are being forced to adapt quickly to such transformations in order to thrive or even merely survive. Many private company managers have concluded that it is timely and prudent to look at being acquired by a properly capitalized strategic partner in order to remain competitive in this type of economic environment. This new strategic alliance could come from a publicly traded company or a privately held competitor with greater access to equity or debt capital, or one that possesses enhanced advertising and marketing capabilities, and has capital intensive, expansive product engineering, and sales and support capabilities. For these and other reasons, there has been significant energy involving mergers and acquisitions in the oil and gas industries at present. Many large firms involved in this industry have established corporate growth strategies that consistently include acquisitions. These experienced buyers search for companies that fit their well-defined acquisition criteria, often attempting to buy companies that are not actively for sale, seeking to generate exponential growth through the purchase of complimentary businesses. Production companies are obvious targets of interest partly because they have established revenue streams and are compatible with our core revenue generating business model. Service related businesses, such as drillers, are also of interest because they will allow us to control our recompletion and drilling schedules on our leased acreage. Therefore, during the coming months, in an effort to broaden our revenue generating capabilities, we plan to aggressively explore and pursue these types of strategic acquisition opportunities. 48 TITLE TO PROPERTIES: We are not the record owner of our interest in our properties and rely instead on contracts with the owner or operator of the property, pursuant to which, among other things, we have the right to have our interest placed of record. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, a preliminary title examination will be conducted at the time unproved properties or interests are acquired by us. Prior to commencement of drilling operations on such acreage and prior to the acquisition of proved properties, we will conduct a title examination and attempt extremely significant defects before proceeding with operations or the acquisition of proved properties, as we may deem appropriate. Our properties are subject to royalty, overriding royalty and other interests customary in the industry, liens incident to agreements, current taxes and other burdens, minor encumbrances, easements and restrictions. Although we are not aware of any material title defects or disputes with respect to its undeveloped acreage, to the extent such defects or disputes exist, we would suffer title failures. BACKLOG OF ORDERS: We currently have no orders for sales at this time. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS: We have no government contracts. COMPANY SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: We are not conducting any research. NUMBER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED: As of May 27, 2008, we had no full-time employees. Officers and Directors work on an as needed part-time basis up to 15 hours per week. PLAN OF OPERATIONS We had no operations prior to and we did not have any revenues during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. We did not recognize any income in the year ended December 31, 2006. We have minimal capital, minimal cash, and only our intangible assets consist of our business plan, relationships, contacts and farmout mineral prospect. We are illiquid and need cash infusions from investors or shareholders to provide capital, or loans from any sources. Our plan of operations is as follows: MILESTONES - ----------------------------------- -- ---------------------------------------- 2nd Quarter 2008 Completion of Registration Statement - ----------------------------------- -- ---------------------------------------- 3rd Quarter 2008 Closure of Registration Statement; - ----------------------------------- -- ---------------------------------------- 4th Quarter 2008 Commence revenue from operations - ----------------------------------- -- ---------------------------------------- 1st Quarter 2009 Acquire additional producing properties - ----------------------------------- -- ---------------------------------------- Our Budget for operations in next year is as follows: REQUIREMENTS AND UTILIZATION OF FUNDS: We initially seek to raise approximately $250,000 during the upcoming three to six months, from the sale of our Company's common stock.. These monies will be used to acquire undeveloped acreage, properties with known production and for operating expenses. Phase Two funds will be used for the acquisition of oil and gas properties containing proven reserves, production enhancements on our existing producing properties and operating expenses. Phase Three funds will be used for the acquisition of additional oil and gas leases, production enhancements and operating expenses. Additional capital may be raised for the acquisition of profitable, privately held exploration and production businesses. As set forth in the chart below, the estimated breakdown of the utilization of funds is as follows: 49 Bedrock Energy, Inc. - Requirements & Utilization of Funds Phase I Phase II Phase III Lease Acq & Development costs $100,000 $500,000 $1,500,000 Working Capital 50,000 400,000 550,000 General & Administrative 75,000 175,000 200,000 Financing Costs 0 125,000 175,000 Audit/SEC Filing Fees 25,000 50,000 75,000 ------------ ----------------- --------------- Total $250,000 $1,250,000 $2,500,000 ============ ================= =============== We will need substantial additional capital to support our proposed future energy operations. We have NO revenues. We have NO committed source for any funds as of date here. No representation is made that any funds will be available when needed. In the event funds cannot be raised when needed, we may not be able to carry out our business plan, may never achieve sales or royalty income, and could fail in business as a result of these uncertainties. Decisions regarding future participation in exploration wells or geophysical studies or other activities will be made on a case-by-case basis. We may, in any particular case, decide to participate or decline participation. If participating, we may pay our proportionate share of costs to maintain our proportionate interest through cash flow or debt or equity financing. If participation is declined, we may elect to farmout, non-consent, sell or otherwise negotiate a method of cost sharing in order to maintain some continuing interest in the prospect.

MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS MARKET INFORMATION Currently there is no public trading market for our stock, and we have not applied to have the common stock quoted for trading in any venue. We intend to apply to have the common stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board ("OTC/BB") immediately after filing this registration statement. No trading symbol has yet been assigned. The offering of the shares registered hereby could have a material negative effect on the market price for the stock if it is approved for quotation on the OTC/BB. RULES GOVERNING LOW-PRICE STOCKS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO RESELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK Our stock currently is not traded on any stock exchange or quoted on any stock quotation system. After filing the registration statement in which this prospectus is included, we intend to solicit a broker to apply for quotation of common stock on the FINRA's OTC/BB. Quotations on the OTC/BB reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, markdown or commission and may not reflect actual transactions. Our common stock will be subject to certain rules adopted by the SEC that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in "penny stocks." Penny stocks generally are securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that the exchange or system provides current price and volume information with respect to transaction in such securities. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon broker-dealers are and may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our shares which could severely limit the market liquidity of the shares and impede the sale of shares in the secondary market. The penny stock rules require broker-dealers, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to make a special suitability determination for the purchaser to receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to sale, to deliver standardized risk disclosure documents prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock. In addition, the penny stock regulations require the broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a broker-dealer is required to send monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the penny stock held in a customer's account and information with respect to the limited market in penny stocks. HOLDERS As of the filing of this prospectus, we have 783 shareholders of record of our common stock. Sales under Rule 144 are also subject to manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us. Under Rule 144(k), a person who has not been one of our affiliates at any time during the three months preceding a sale, and who has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least 6 months, is entitled to sell shares without complying with the manner of sale, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144. As of the date of this prospectus, our selling shareholders hold 2,525,524 Shares, all of which may be sold pursuant to this Registration Statement, including those of affiliates who are also officers/directors who own 785,060 in the aggregate. 51 DIVIDENDS As of the filing of this prospectus, we have not paid any dividends to shareholders. There are no restrictions which would limit our ability to pay dividends on common equity or that are likely to do so in the future. The Colorado Revised Statutes, however, do prohibit us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend; we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or our total assets would be less than the sum of the total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution.

F-6 BEDROCK ENERGY, INC. (FORMERLY CELLTOUCH, INC.) (A COMPANY IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ORGANIZATION CellTouch, Inc., now known as Bedrock Energy Inc., was incorporated in Colorado on August 11, 2004 with its name changed to Bedrock Energy, Inc. on October 18, 2007. Enviromart.com, Inc. was incorporated in New Hampshire in March 1999. On September 21, 2004 CellTouch, Inc. and Enviromart.com, Inc. (collectively the "Company") were merged under the laws of the State of Colorado and CellTouch, Inc. became the surviving entity. The Company has been in the development stage since its inception. Activities through December 31, 2007 include the raising of equity capital and the formation of a previous business plan to sell environmental products over the Internet as well as the current business plan to merge with or acquire and develop assets from a company in the oil and gas industry. STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS For purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash includes deposits in commercial bank accounts. INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under the asset and liability method of SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. INCOME PER SHARE Income per share requires presentation of both basic and diluted income per common share. Common share equivalents are not included in the weighted average calculation since their effect would be anti-dilutive. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. F-7 BEDROCK ENERGY, INC. (FORMERLY CELLTOUCH, INC.) (A COMPANY IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company's financial instruments, including cash, other assets and payables approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of those instruments. NOTE 2 - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY COMMON SHARE The Company is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of $.001 voting common stock. There were a total of 1,245,000 shares of common stock issued during the year ended December 31, 2007 and, therefore, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 there are a total of 2,235,524 and 990,524 shares issued and outstanding, respectively. These additional shares were comprised of 300,000 shares sold as part of a private placement at $.10 per share, 420,000 shares issued as payment of debt in the amount of $84,000 (See Note 3) and 525,000 shares issued to consultants for services valued at $52,500. On August 2, 2007, the Company authorized the sale in a private placement of 1,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $.05 per share under an exemption from registration provision of the Securities Act of 1933. The funds will be used to pay the costs associated with its administration and payment of professional fees to bring the Company to a fully reporting company within compliance of the Securities Act of 1933 and 1934. On October 17, 2007, the Company authorized up to a one for two reverse split of the Company's common stock. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has taken no action to institute the reverse split. The reverse split was effective on March 31, 2008. The Company has restated its total number of outstanding and issued shares of common stock as of December 31, 2006 from 1,000,000 shares to 990,524 shares and as a result has adjusted the par value dollar amount of common stock from $2,000 to $1,981 with the difference of $19 being recorded as an increase in Additional paid in capital. PREFERRED SHARE The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of no par value preferred stock. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company has no shares issued and outstanding. F-8 BEDROCK ENERGY, INC. (FORMERLY CELLTOUCH, INC.) (A COMPANY IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, two officers of the Company each earned for services rendered fees in the amount of $6,000 and $18,000 respectively and these fees were recorded as accounts payable. Thus, as of April 30, 2007, the Company had an accounts payable balance of $84,000 or a total of $42,000 per officer. Subsequently, the Company issued promissory notes ("Notes") dated May 1, 2007 to each of its two officers in exchange for payment of these accounts payable as of April 30, 2007 in the amount of $42,000 for a total of $84,000 in Notes. Each of these seven percent (7%) unsecured convertible Notes due April 30, 2008 could be converted into shares of common stock at the rate of ten (10) shares for each dollar of principal converted.

(collectively the "Company") were merged under the laws of the State of Colorado and CellTouch, Inc. became the surviving entity. The Company has been in the development stage since its inception. Activities through March 31, 2008, include the raising of equity capital and the formation of a previous business plan to sell environmental products over the Internet as well as the current business plan to merge with or acquire and develop assets from a company in the oil and gas industry. BASIS OF PRESENTATION DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY The Company has not earned significant revenues from planned operations. Accordingly, the Company's activities have been accounted for as those of a "Development Stage Company", as set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 7 ("SFAS"). Among the disclosures required by SFAS No. 7 are that the Company's financial statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows disclose activity since the date of the Company's inception. GOING CONCERN In the Company's Audited Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, the Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm includes an explanatory paragraph that describes substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

INCOME PER SHARE Income per share requires presentation of both basic and diluted income per common share. Common share equivalents are not included in the weighted average calculation since their effect would be anti-dilutive. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company's financial instruments, including cash, other assets and payables approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of those instruments.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO AND THE OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF ANY NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE SET FORTH UNDER "RISK FACTORS" ON PAGE 7 AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. PLAN OF OPERATIONS We had no operations prior to and we had no revenues during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. We have minimal capital and minimal cash. We are illiquid and need cash infusions from investors or shareholders to provide capital, or loans from any sources. We are an oil and gas exploration and development company focused on creating a portfolio of North American assets, located in the central and Western United States that exhibit consistent, predictable, and long-lived production capabilities. We plan to build value for its shareholders through the acquisition and development of gas and oil assets that contain proven reserves in domestic areas where reserves can be economically produced at a low risk to us relying on joint venture partners to supply most of the funds needed to explore or develop these properties. We intend to participate in oil and gas prospects located in the states of Utah, Wyoming, Kansas, New Mexico, and Colorado. Our main emphasis will be to acquire production or revenue generating opportunities either by lease purchase or farmout, when available, with third parties and industry partners. We will need substantial additional capital to support our proposed future energy operations. We have NO revenues. We have NO committed source for any funds as of date here. No representation is made that any funds will be available when needed. In the event funds cannot be raised when needed, we may not be able to carry out our business plan, may never achieve sales or royalty income, and could fail in business as a result of these uncertainties. Decisions regarding future participation in exploration wells or geophysical studies or other activities will be made on a case-by-case basis. We may, in any particular case, decide to participate or decline participation. If participating, we may pay our proportionate share of costs to maintain our proportionate interest through cash flow or debt or equity financing. If participation is declined, we may elect to farmout, non-consent, sell or otherwise negotiate a method of cost sharing in order to maintain some continuing interest in the prospect. 53 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we did not recognize any revenues from our business activities. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred total operating expenses of $75,729 compared to $36,000 during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase of $39,729 was a result of the $36,056 increase in professional fees, a result of our efforts to develop our business plan in the oil and gas exploration industries. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred a net loss of $78,097 compared to a net loss of $36,000 during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase of $42,097 is a result of the $39,729 increase in operational expenses due to our increased activity as discussed above. LIQUIDITY At December 31, 2007, we had total assets of $18,771, consisting solely of cash on hand. At December 31, 2007, we had total liabilities of $10,548, consisting of $2,368 in accounts payables and $8,180 in loans from affiliates and shareholders. At December 31, 2007, we had an accumulated deficit of $344,052. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we used net cash of $11,229 in operational activities. During the year ended December 31, 2007, cash of $30,000 from the sale of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we did not use or receive any funds from investing activities.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we issued 420,000 shares of our restricted common stock, at a price of $0.20 per share as payment on outstanding debt of $84,000. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, two officers of the Company had each provided services for the Company, which were accrued by the Company. In May 2007, the Company issued each of the officers a 7% unsecured note for the outstanding amounts owed to them of $42,000 each for a total of $84,000. The notes had a due date of April 30, 2008. In September 2007, the officers agreed to accept 420,000 shares of common stock each as payment, in full, of the notes. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we issued 300,000 shares of restricted common stock in exchange for cash of $30,000. The shares were sold as part of the private placement of our common stock. The shares had a purchase price of $0.10 per share. We have minimal cash at December 31, 2007 and no other assets, and we will be reliant upon shareholder loans or private placements of equity to fund any kind of operations. We have secured no sources of loans or private placements at this time. SHORT TERM. On a short-term basis, we do not generate any revenue or revenues sufficient to cover operations. Based on prior history, we will continue to have insufficient revenue to satisfy current and recurring liabilities. For short term needs we will be dependent on receipt, if any, of offering proceeds. CAPITAL RESOURCES We have only common stock as our capital resource. 54 We have no material commitments for capital expenditures within the next year, however if operations are commenced, substantial capital will be needed to pay for participation, investigation, exploration, acquisition and working capital. NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING We do not have capital sufficient to meet our cash needs. We will have to seek loans or equity placements to cover such cash needs. Once exploration commences, our needs for additional financing is likely to increase substantially. No commitments to provide additional funds have been made by our management or other stockholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any additional funds will be available to us to allow it to cover our expenses as they may be incurred. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2008 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2007 During the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, we did not recognize any revenues from our business activities.

The increase in professional fees and general and administrative expenses is a result of our efforts to develop our business plan in the oil and gas exploration industries and our efforts to file a Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the three months ended March 31, 2008, we incurred a net loss of $11,474 compared to a net loss of $9,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2007.

The shares were sold as part of the private placement of our common stock. The shares had a purchase price of $0.10 per share. 55 We have minimal cash at March 31, 2008 and no other assets, and we will be reliant upon shareholder loans or private placements of equity to fund any kind of operations. We have secured no sources of loans or private placements at this time. SHORT TERM. On a short-term basis, we do not generate any revenue or revenues sufficient to cover operations. Based on prior history, we will continue to have insufficient revenue to satisfy current and recurring liabilities. For short term needs we will be dependent on receipt, if any, of offering proceeds. CAPITAL RESOURCES We have only common stock as our capital resource. We have no material commitments for capital expenditures within the next year, however if operations are commenced, substantial capital will be needed to pay for participation, investigation, exploration, acquisition and working capital. NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING We do not have capital sufficient to meet our cash needs. We will have to seek loans or equity placements to cover such cash needs. Once exploration commences, our needs for additional financing is likely to increase substantially. No commitments to provide additional funds have been made by our management or other stockholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any additional funds will be available to us to allow it to cover our expenses as they may be incurred. I.

DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS NAME AGE POSITION TERM - ----------------------- ----------------- ---------------------------- --------- W. Edward Nichols 65 President, CEO, Annual Secretary/Treasurer and Chairman Herbert T. Sears 61 Chief Financial Officer Annual and Director 56 W. EDWARD NICHOLS: PRESIDENT, CEO SECRETARY/TREASURER AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD: Mr. Nichols is currently a practicing attorney with Nichols & Nichols in Denver, Colorado. He is authorized to practice in the states of Colorado and Kansas, the United States Federal Courts, and Supreme Court of the United States. He is also Managing Director of Nichols & Company LLC, a management consulting firm and has worked as a private investment banker and consultant with venture capital companies in the U.S. and Europe. Mr. Nichols grew up in the oil patch and has owned and operated gas processing plants in Kansas and Wyoming. He has also co-owned and operated oil drilling, production and gas gathering companies in Kansas. HERBERT T. SEARS: CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND DIRECTOR: Mr. Sears is a seasoned attorney with more than thirty years of international experience specializing in contracts, claims, and corporate restructuring. He was formerly a Vice President and Counsel to Stone & Webster, an international multi-billion dollar engineering and construction firm. Mr. Sears currently is the court appointed Trustee for the Stone and Webster Liquidating Trust with responsibility for liquidating the global assets of the former Stone & Webster operating companies. In addition, he advises global engineering companies with respect to their international legal activities. He has also been actively involved in a variety of major engineering and construction projects during the past two decades in Europe, Scandinavia, Asia and the Middle East. Mr. Sears graduated from Boston University School of Management with a B.S/B.A in International Business and earned his law degree from Washington University School of Law. Our officers are spending up to 15 hours per week on our business at this time. At such time as the Company is financially capable of paying salaries, it is anticipated that management will assume full time roles in the Company's operations and be paid accordingly. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST - GENERAL. Our directors and officers are, or may become, in their individual capacities, officers, directors, controlling shareholder and/or partners of other entities engaged in a variety of businesses. Thus, there exist potential conflicts of interest including, among other things, time, efforts and corporation opportunity, involved in participation with such other business entities. While each officer and director of our business is engaged in business activities outside of our business, the amount of time they devote to our business will be up to approximately 15 hours per week. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST - CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES Presently no requirement contained in our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, or minutes which requires officers and directors of our business to disclose to us business opportunities which come to their attention. Our officers and directors do, however, have a fiduciary duty of loyalty to us to disclose to us any business opportunities which come to their attention, in their capacity as an officer and/or director or otherwise. Excluded from this duty would be opportunities which the person learns about through his involvement as an officer and director of another company. We have no intention of merging with or acquiring an affiliate, associate person or business opportunity from any affiliate or any client of any such person. PROJECTED STAFF STAFFING Currently, we have no employees aside from the President who is part time. This lean staffing is possible in this phase because of our determination to outsource all operating functions. Our staff positions will be filled as budget allows and business demands require, and the positions may be altered in response to business needs. 57 L.

All officers and directors have retained the right to conduct their own independent business interests. It is possible that situations may arise in the future where the personal interests of the officers and directors may conflict with our interests. Such conflicts could include determining what portion of their working time will be spent on our business and what portion on other business interest. To the best ability and in the best judgment of our officers and directors, any conflicts of interest between us and the personal interests of our officers and directors will be resolved in a fair manner which will protect our interests. Any transactions between us and entities affiliated with our officers and directors will be on terms which are fair and equitable to us. Our Board of Directors intends to continually review all corporate opportunities to further attempt to safeguard against conflicts of interest between their business interests and our interests. We have no intention of merging with or acquiring an affiliate, associated person or business opportunity from any affiliate or any client of any such person.

MATERIAL CHANGES Not applicable. ITEM 12. INCORPORATION OF CERTAIN INFORMATION BY REFERENCE Not applicable. ITEM 12A. DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION OF INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES The Colorado Business Corporation Act requires us to indemnify officers and directors for any expenses incurred by any officer or director in connection with any actions or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, brought against such officer or director because of his or her status as an officer or director, to the extent that the director or officer has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of the action or proceeding. The Colorado Business Corporation Act permits a corporation to indemnify an officer or director, even in the absence of an agreement to do so, for expenses incurred in connection with any action or proceeding if such officer or director acted in good faith and in a manner in which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of us and such indemnification is authorized by the stockholders, by a quorum of disinterested directors, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion authorized by a majority vote of a quorum of directors consisting of disinterested directors, or by independent legal counsel in a written opinion if a quorum of disinterested directors cannot be obtained. The Colorado Business Corporation Act prohibits indemnification of a director or officer if a final adjudication establishes that the officer's or director's acts or omissions involved intentional misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation of the law and were material to the cause of action. Despite the foregoing limitations on indemnification, the Colorado Business Corporation Act may permit an officer or director to apply to the court for approval of indemnification even if the officer or director is adjudged to have committed intentional misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation of the law. The Colorado Business Corporation Act also provides that indemnification of directors is not permitted for the unlawful payment of distributions, except for those directors registering their dissent to the payment of the distribution. According to our bylaws, we are authorized to indemnify our directors to the fullest extent authorized under Colorado Law subject to certain specified limitations. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to directors, officers and persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, we are advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. 61 [OUTSIDE BACK COVER PAGE OF PROSPECTUS] DEALER PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS Until ninety (90) days from the effective date of this registration statement, all dealers that effect transactions in these securities, whether or not participating in this offering, may be required to deliver a prospectus.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS Bedrock Energy, Inc. officers and directors are indemnified as provided by the Colorado Revised Statutes and the bylaws. Under the Colorado Revised Statutes, director immunity from liability to a company or its shareholders for monetary liabilities applies automatically unless it is specifically limited by a company's Articles of Incorporation. Our Articles of Incorporation do not specifically limit the directors' immunity. Excepted from that immunity are: (a) a willful failure to deal fairly with us or our shareholders in connection with a matter in which the director has a material conflict of interest; (b) a violation of criminal law, unless the director had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was lawful or no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful; (c) a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal profit; and (d) willful misconduct. Our bylaws provide that it will indemnify the directors to the fullest extent not prohibited by Colorado law; provided, however, that we may modify the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with the directors and officers; and, provided, further, that we shall not be required to indemnify any director or officer in connection with any proceeding, or part thereof, initiated by such person unless such indemnification: (a) is expressly required to be made by law, (b) the proceeding was authorized by the board of directors, (c) is provided by us, in sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested under Colorado law or (d) is required to be made pursuant to the bylaws. Our bylaws provide that it will advance to any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of us, or is or was serving at the request of us as a director or executive officer of another company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefore, all expenses incurred by any director or officer in connection with such proceeding 62 upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under the bylaws or otherwise. Our bylaws provide that no advance shall be made by us to an officer except by reason of the fact that such officer is or was our director in which event this paragraph shall not apply, in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly made: (a) by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (b) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of us.

In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of the directors, officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of the directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, 64 submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
