PN MED GROUP INC UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 5,000,000 COMMON SHARES AT $0.02 PER COMMON SHARE This is the initial offering of common stock of PN Med Group Inc. and no public market currently exists for the securities being offered. We are offering for sale a total of 5,000,000 shares of common stock at a fixed price of $.02 per share. There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the offering to proceed, and we will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered shares. There is no minimum amount of shares that we must sell in our direct offering, and therefore no minimum amount of proceeds will be raised. No arrangements have been made to place funds into escrow or any similar account. Pedro Perez Niklitschek, an officer and director of PN Med Group Inc. or ("PNMG INC.") intends to sell the common shares directly. No commission or other compensation related to the sale of the common shares will be paid to Mr. Pedro Perez Niklitschek. The intended methods of communication include, without limitations, telephone, and personal contact.

REFERS TO PN MED GROUP INC. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS NOT COMPLETE AND DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. PNMG INC. We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 30, 2012. PN Med Group Inc. (or "the company" or "PNMG") is a distributor of medical supplies and equipment to municipalities, hospitals, pharmacies, care centers, and clinics in Chile. We intend to provide reliable and fast service with low prices to our customers. We expect to generate revenues from sales of our supplies to customers. A customer will order our supplies by telephone, from our website www.pnmedgroup.com using special form, or directly at an arranged meeting with our representative. We will import all the supplies and equipment straight from the manufacturer in China and deliver them to our clients in Chile without the help of commission base agents. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations (See "Description of Business" and "Use of Proceeds"). To implement our plan of operations we need ($24,450) and pay ongoing legal fee associated with this offering ($10,000); we require a minimum of $34,450 for the next twelve months as described in our Plan of Operations. Our monthly burn rate is approximately $2,871. This is a simple monthly estimate of company's expenses that include all the expenses described in our plan of operations; it is calculated by dividing $34,450 by 12 months. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. The present capital will not be sufficient to fund our operation for any period of time at this burn rate. We depend on funds from this public offering. We will utilize funds from Pedro Perez Niklitschek, our Officer and Director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees, including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses; however, Mr. Niklitschek has made no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. A more detailed breakdown of costs is included in our plan of operations. The month on which we will run out of funds will depend on the amount of funds we raise in this offering. Our principal executive office is located at San Isidro 250, depto 618, Santiago, Chile, 8240400. Our telephone number is (569) 65922350. From inception on January 30, 2012 until the date of this filing, we have had limited operating activities. Our financial statements from inception on January 30, 2012 through March 31, 2012 report no revenues and a net loss of $4,657. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for PNMG Inc which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We do not anticipate earning revenues until such time as we enter into commercial operation. Since we are presently in the development stage of our business, we can provide no assurance that we will successfully sell our products. As of the date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our securities will ever develop. THE OFFERING The Issuer PNMG INC. Securities Being Offered 5,000,000 shares of common stock Price Per Share $0.02 3 Duration of the Offering The offering shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the date when the sale of all 5,000,000 shares is completed, (ii) when the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interest of the Company to terminate the offering prior the completion of the sale of all 5,000,000 shares registered under the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is part. Net Proceeds $100,000 Securities Issued and Outstanding There are 5,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus. 5,000,000 shares held by our President, Pedro Perez Niklitschek. Registration Costs We estimate our total offering registration costs to be approximately $10,000. Risk Factors See "Risk Factors" and the other information in this prospectus for a discussion of the factors you should consider before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. 4 RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock, when and if we trade at a later date, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. RISKS ASSOCIATED TO OUR BUSINESS WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY BUT HAVE NOT YET COMMENCED OPERATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We were incorporated on January 30, 2012 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We have not yet commenced business operations. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. We have not earned any revenues as of the date of this prospectus. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new transportations companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We estimate "significant losses" to be up to $100,000 which is our maximum offering. Our losses could be higher after the first twelve months period. We recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail. WITHOUT THE FUNDING FROM THIS OFFERING WE WILL BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN. Our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations of distributing medical supplies and equipment to Chile. We will need the funds from this offering to commence activities listed in our business plan. As of March 31, 2012, we had cash in the amount of $8,443 and liabilities of $4,657. We currently do not have any operations and we have no income. WE HAVE YET TO EARN REVENUE AND OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE FINANCING FROM THIS OFFERING. AS A RESULT, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. We have accrued net losses of $4,657 for the period from our inception on January 30, 2012 to March 31, 2012, and have no revenues to date. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing from this offering. Further, the finances required to fully develop our plan cannot be predicted with any certainty and may exceed any estimates we set forth. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. Silberstein Ungar, PLLC, our independent registered public accountant, has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion could materially limit our ability to raise funds. If we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed, we will not be able to complete our business plan. As a result we may have to liquidate our business and you may lose your investment. You should consider our independent registered public accountant's comments when determining if an investment in PNMG Inc. is suitable. WE MAY FACE DAMAGE TO OUR PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION IF OUR FUTURE CLIENTS ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH OUR SERVICES. IN THIS CASE, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FUTURE ENGAGEMENTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ENGAGEMENTS, INVESTORS ARE LIKELY TO LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. 5 As a distribution company, we depend and will continue to depend to a large extent on referrals and new engagements from our former customers, as we will attempt to establish a reputation for professional service company and integrity to attract and customers. As a result, if a customer is not satisfied with our services, such lack of satisfaction may be more damaging to our business than it may be to other businesses. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that we will obtain customers in the foreseeable future. IF WE DO NOT ATTRACT CUSTOMERS, WE WILL NOT MAKE A PROFIT, WHICH ULTIMATELY WILL RESULT IN A CESSATION OF OPERATIONS. We currently have no signed agreements with customers to purchase our services. At this time we have approached five local clients with view to offer our product to them: Hospital Claudio Vicuna, Dr. Juan Villagran Gacia, Municipality of Puerto Montt, EquilLab LTDA, and Santa Maria Clinic. There is no guarantee we will ever conduct business with these or any other customers. Even if we obtain business from the above listed customers, there is no guarantee that we will generate a profit. If we cannot generate a profit, we will have to suspend or cease operations. You are likely to lose your entire investment if we cannot sell our products at prices that generate a profit. WE ARE SUBJECT TO BUSINESS RISKS AND INCREASING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSPORTATION OF OUR PRODUCTS THAT ARE LARGELY OUT OF OUR CONTROL, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. We are subject to business risks and increasing costs associated with the transportation of our products that are largely out of our control, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The factors contributing to these risks and costs include weather, excess capacity in the transportation industry, interest rates, fuel prices and taxes, fuel surcharge collection, impact on liquidity from the lag between higher payments for fuel and the collection of higher fuel surcharges in a rising fuel cost environment, terrorist attacks, insurance premiums and self-insurance levels, difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified drivers, the risk of outbreak of epidemical illnesses, the risk of widespread disruption of our technology systems, and increasing equipment and operational costs. Our results of operations may also be affected by seasonal factors. THE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY IS CYCLICAL AND IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AN INDUSTRY AND GENERAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN OR RECESSION THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. Distribution services historically have been subject to substantial cyclical variation characterized by periods of oversupply and weak demand. We believe that many factors affect the industry, including consumer confidence in the economy, the level of personal discretionary spending, interest rates, fuel prices, credit availability and unemployment rates. At this time, we cannot predict the severity or duration of the slowdown and we cannot assure that our business will not be materially adversely affected if it continues or worsens. Accordingly, you are likely to lose your entire investment if the current slump in distribution industry continues. WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE WITH OUR COMPETITORS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competition includes small and midsized companies, and many of them may sell the same services at competitive prices. Highly competitive environment could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. 6 BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE AN ESCROW OR TRUST ACCOUNT FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, IF WE FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION OR ARE FORCED INTO BANKRUPTCY, OR A CREDITOR OBTAINS A JUDGMENT AGAINST US AND ATTACHES THE SUBSCRIPTION. Your funds will not be placed in an escrow or trust account. Accordingly, if we file for bankruptcy protection or a petition for involuntary bankruptcy is filed by creditors against us, your funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to the bankruptcy laws. If a creditor sues us and obtains a judgment against us, the creditor could garnish the bank account and take possession of the subscriptions. As such, it is possible that a creditor could attach your subscription that could preclude or delay the return of money to you. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RECRUIT, MOTIVATE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONAL, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. The success of our business will depend upon our ability to attract and retain through independent contractor or other arrangements, qualified employees who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the needs of our operations. We will compete in markets in which unemployment is generally relatively low and the competition for skilled employees is intense. We cannot assure that qualified employees will be available in sufficient numbers and on terms acceptable to us. The inability to attract and retain qualified personal, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. BECAUSE OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT AND OFFICERS DEVOTE LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME TO THE COMPANY, THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE OR WILLING TO DEVOTE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIME TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, CAUSING OUR BUSINESS TO FAIL. Pedro Perez Nikltschek, our President, currently devotes approximately 20 hours per week providing management services to us. While he presently possesses adequate time to attend to our interest, it is possible that the demands on him from other obligations could increase, with the result that he would no longer be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business. The loss of Mr. Nikltschek to our company could negatively impact our business development. Mr. Urra, our secretary and executive officer, currently devotes approximately 20 hours per week providing management services to us. While he presently possesses adequate time to attend to our interest, it is possible that the demands on him from other obligations could increase, with the result that he would no longer be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business. The loss of Mr. Urra to our company could negatively impact our business development. OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTOR DO NOT HAVE ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE CONDUCTING A BEST-EFFORT OFFERING, OR MANAGING A PUBLIC COMPANY Our executive officers and director do not have any experience conducting a best-effort offering or managing a public company. Consequently, we may not be able to raise any funds or run our public company successfully. If we are not able to raise sufficient funds, we may not be able to fund our operations as planned, and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected. Also, our executive's officers' and director's lack of experience of managing a public company could cause you to lose some or all of your investment. THERE IS NO MINIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES THAT HAS TO BE SOLD IN ORDER FOR THE OFFERING TO PROCEED We do not have a minimum amount of funding set in order to proceed with the offering. If not enough money is raised to begin operations, you might lose your entire investment because we may not have enough funds to implement our business plan. 7 RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING THE TRADING IN OUR SHARES WILL BE REGULATED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULE 15G-9 WHICH ESTABLISHED THE DEFINITION OF A "PENNY STOCK." The shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 (exclusive of the value of investor's primary residence) or annual income exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES. This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to sell our shares through our President, who will receive no commissions. He will offer the shares to friends, family members, and business associates, however, there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless he is successful in selling all of the shares and we receive the proceeds from this offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan. We do not have any plans where to seek this alternative financing at present time. DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING. We are not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board ("BB"). The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities. The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements per se, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. Market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings between PN Med Group Inc. and anyone acting on our behalf, with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment. 8 WE WILL INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE. WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL. Our business plan allows for the payment of the estimated $10,000 cost of this registration statement to be paid from existing cash on hand. If necessary, Mr. Niklitschek, our Chairman, has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. We use words such as "anticipate", "believe", "plan", "expect", "future", "intend", and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us as described in the "Risk Factors" section and elsewhere in this prospectus. USE OF PROCEEDS Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $100,000 as anticipated. $25,000 $50,000 $75,000 $100,000 ------- ------- ------- -------- Legal and professional fees $10,000 $10,000 $10,000 $10,000 Web development $ 650 $ 2,000 $ 3,000 $ 3,000 Establishing an office $ 6,850 $13,000 $13,000 $13,000 Order supplies and equipment $ 5,000 $13,000 $37,000 $50,000 Car $ 2,500 $12,000 $12,000 $12,000 Recently we have developed our website and paid $500. Twelve months hosting with registration of our domain www.pnmedgroup.com cost additional $150. To start establishing an office will cost us $550 for laptop, $300 for four chairs; We are currently using our director's home office for business purposes, we do not pay rent to Mr. Niklitschek and have no arrangements to pay the rent in the future. We plan to lease 150 sq. feet office space in the beginning of January 2013 in the center of Santiago; the office will cost approximately $6,000 for the year, we currently have not made any arrangements for larger office. We intend to purchase supplies and equipment utilizing proceeds from this offering and funds from Mr. Niklitschek if necessary. Our first order will be in the amount of $5,000. For delivering our supplies and equipment we will be using two cars: Mr.Niklitschek agreed to use his car (2007 Suzuki) as our first car and we will be renting the second car for $2,500 per year. By January 2013, we plan on purchasing 2007-2009 Peugeot Partner (cost per car $12,000). We intend to hire two employees as soon as our operations grow estimated to be at the end of December 2012. Our employees will be compensated solely by commission payments based on their performance. The payment to our employees 9 will come from medical supplies and equipment sales. Proceeds of this offering will not be used to pay our employees. The above figures represent only estimated cost. If necessary, Mr.Niklitschek, our president, has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process and to implement our complete business plan. DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities. DILUTION Dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders. The price of the current offering is fixed at $0.02 per common share. This price is significantly higher than the price paid by our director and officers for common equity since the Company's inception on January 30, 2012. There are 5,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus. Mr.Niklitschek, our director and president, paid $.001 per share for the 5,000,000 common shares. Assuming completion of the offering, there will be up to 15,000,000 common shares outstanding.

We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Mr. Niklitschek, our president, who has informally agreed to advance funds to us. Our president has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to achieve our business plan goals, we will need the funding from this offering. We are a development stage company and have generated no revenue to date. Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage. To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. We believe that we will be able to raise enough money through this offering to expand operations but we cannot guarantee that once we expand operations we will stay in business after doing so. If we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering. PLAN OF OPERATION Our sales and marketing strategy will expand our customer's base as quickly as possible. The marketing thrust will consist of direct contact to the responsible personal at selected hospitals, clinics, and care centers, the distribution of our product list along with our guarantee of fast services to Pharmacies, Municipalities, and home based care centers, and direct mailing to new high worth individuals using the resources of a list company. We will not be conducting any product research or development. We do not expect to purchase or sell plant of any kind. Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to profitably sell our products. Our plan of operations is as follows: a) DEVELOP OUR WEBSITE Period: 1st month 1) We have further developed our website www.pnmedgroup.com, this cost the company $500 to date. Twelve months hosting with registration of our domain will cost additional $150 (www. hostgator.com). b) SET UP OFFICE WITHIN THE OFFICE AND BEGIN SEARCHING FOR MORE CUSTOMERS. Period: 1-3rd months 1) Purchase office equipment such as computer (laptop): $550; office table and few chairs: $300. 2) Order sufficient amount of medical supply and equipment from our supplier in China, Minimum cost is: $5,000. 3) Begin approaching hospitals, clinics, care centers, pharmacies and municipalities and offering our products and services to their representatives; negotiating price, payment details, delivery times. 4) Put together a product list brochure for clients and potential clients. c) PROMOTE OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCT TO POTENTIAL CLIENTS Period: 3rd month 1) Receive our products from the manufacturer and begin arrangements with the customers offering our products 2) Start delivering our products to the customers who order it. 3) Advertise and promote our products on a national webpage www.mercadopublico.cl 11 d) ONLINE MARKETING Period: 4th-8th months 1) Begin blogging, e-newsletters, social networking, searching engine optimizer (SEO). 2) Follow up with our current customers and try to generate new referrals. 3) Continue looking for new customers throughout the territory of Chile. e) BUYING 2ND CAR, HIRING EMPLOYEES, NEW AGREEMENTS Period: 9th -12th month 1) Purchase additional car for our operations. The number of new cars will depend on the amount of revenue that we have available. We will purchase 2007-2009 Peugeot Partner (cost estimated $12,000). 2) We will hire two more sales reps. and two more drivers to make deliveries to our clients. Compensation will be in form or commission payment from sales. 3) Sign agreements with more suppliers in China. 4) Rent an office space with storage (approximately 500 sq. feet) in the center of Santiago. Cost of lease for a year $6,000. Total: $24,500 To implement our plan of operations ($24,500) and pay ongoing legal fee associated with this offering ($10,000) we require a minimum of $34,500 for the next twelve months as described in our Plan of Operations. After twelve months period we may need additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Until we start to sell our products we do not believe that our operations will be profitable. If we are unable to attract customers to order supplies with us we may have to suspend or cease operations. Mr. Niklitschek, our president, will be devoting approximately 20 hours per week of his time to our operations. Once we expand operations, and are able to attract more and more customers to buy our product, our president has agreed to commit more time as required. Because Mr. Niklitschek will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a cessation of operations. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM INCEPTION JANUARY 30, 2012 TO MARCH 31, 2012 During the period we incorporated the company, prepared a business plan, and executed an agreement with Kangtai Medical Devices Co., the supplier, in China. The following are some of the terms of the agreement: a) Kangtai Medical Devices Co. offers us free shipping, discount prices and a fast processing time. b) PNMG have agreed to make an order from Kangtai Medical Devices Co. at least once every 3 months and diligently promote their products. 12 c) Kangtai Medical Devices Co will act as our exclusive distributor of manufacturer's medical devices throughout the territory of Chile. d) Manufacturer agrees to furnish Distributor with reasonable quantities of Manufacturer's catalogs, manuals, advertising literature and other sales aids that may be available by Manufacturer. With the expansion of the company we intend to sign more agreements with suppliers and factories in other countries such as India, Philippines, Turkey, Poland, and Kazakhstan. We have hired a contractor, Caroline Olmedo at Olmedo Web Designs, to develop our website www.pnmedgroup.com. The following sections were added: Home/Concept/ Products/Forum/Contact us. Our customers will be able to submit order requests, view current orders online and/or contact us via email linked to our website. In addition the following features were utilized customizable forms to capture valuable info from customers, addition of PayPal account to offer a reliable way to make payments to the company account, maps and driving directions for locals, Facebook and twitter accounts will also be added as a way of communicating with potential clients. ?The contractor used Macromedia(R) Dreamweaver for our website development. ?The goal was to design a website to fully work in multiple browsers and multiple versions of code/pages. Caroline Olmedo represents and warrants that the website will be supported by the following versions: Microsoft(R) Internet Explorer versions 5 and higher, Netscape Navigator/ Communicator version 4 and higher, Mozilla Firefox version 1.0 and above. While the Contractor made reasonable efforts to design a fully-functional website, Caroline Olmedo warranty does not cover AOL, text-based browsers or requested special effects that were not advised by Contractor. HTML and Flash technologies were merged to ensure that the website is positioned higher in search engine rankings. The website is operational as of February 2012. It cost $500 to complete our website and $150 domain hosting for the year. Our loss since inception is $4,657 for filing costs related to the incorporation of the Company and cost of Nevada business license and bank fees. In the first quarter we used our cash we had to pay expenses associated with this offering. Our current cash on hand will be used to pay the fees and expenses of this offering. Since inception, we have sold a total of 5,000,000 shares of common stock to our secretary and our director for net proceeds of $5,000. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of March 31, 2012 the Company had $8,443 cash and our liabilities were $4,236, comprising $4,236 owed to Pedro Niklitschek, our president. Since inception through March 31, 2012, we have sold 5,000,000 shares of common stock. Mr. Niklitschek our president has paid a price of $0.001 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $5,000. To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise the necessary funds to proceed with all phases of our plan of operation. Proceed of $25,000 from this offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year. As of the date of this registration statement, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining a reporting status. The company's director, Pedro Niklitschek, has indicated that he may be willing to provide funds required to maintain the reporting status in the form of a non-secured loan for the next twelve months as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by the Company. However, there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement. Management believes if the company cannot maintain its reporting status with the SEC it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the company. As such, any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety. Our auditors have issued a "going concern" opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us 13 to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $10,000. Management believes that current trends toward lower capital investment in start-up companies, volatility in the distribution industry will pose the most significant challenges to the Company's success over the next year and in future years. Additionally, the Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Company's management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations. Should the Company fail to sell less than all its shares under this offering the Company would be forced to scale back or abort completely the implementation of its 12-month plan of operations. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Company reports revenues and expenses using the cash basis method of accounting for financial and tax reporting purposes. USE OF ESTIMATES Management uses estimates and assumption in preparing these financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND CAPITALIZATION The Company records depreciation and amortization when appropriate using both straight-line and declining balance methods over the estimated useful life of the assets (five to seven years). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions, major renewals and replacements that increase the property's useful life are capitalized. Property sold or retired, together with the related accumulated depreciation is removed from the appropriated accounts and the resultant gain or loss is included in net income. INCOME TAXES PN Med Group Inc. accounts for its income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under Statement 109, a liability method is used whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between basis used of financial reporting and income tax reporting purposes. Income taxes are provided based on tax rates in effect at the time such temporary differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not, that the Company will not realize the tax assets through future operations. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial Accounting Standards statements No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments", requires the Company to disclose, when reasonably attainable, the fair market values of its assets and liabilities which are deemed to be financial instruments. The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash. PER SHARE INFORMATION The Company computes per share information by dividing the net loss for the period presented by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during such period. 14 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS GENERAL We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 30, 2012. PN Med Group Inc. is a distributor of medical supplies and equipment to municipalities, hospitals, pharmacies, care centers, and clinics in Chile. We will import all the supplies and equipment directly from the manufacturers in China and deliver them to our clients in Chile. At this stage, we have no revenues. The operations we have engaged in are the development of our website, business plan as well as a distribution agreement with Kangtai Medical Devices Co. who is our product supplier in China. We have approached five potential clients ranging from hospitals, clinics, and office-based physicians with view to offer our product to them. They have expressed interest in our product but we did not obtain any guarantees or commitments form them to date. The majority of our business will be initially marketed in Chile but as our operations expand, we plan to expand to other South American markets. CONCEPT PNMG will focus on providing helpful customer service. We will have vast selection of products as well as same- day delivery services within 100 miles radius. We also offer a no minimum order size and no shipping charges, as well as returns of unused, saleable products for an instant credit. OUR PRODUCTS The list of products we intend to offer will vary from day to day supplies to more specific medicine droppers and tubes, to very sophisticated medical equipment. Below some of the products that we are in a process of ordering: Cotton wool, white blisters, laboratory bottle rings, mouth universal feeding bottles, latex bulbs, medicine droppers, plastic bottles, cotton swabs, cotton gloves, pediatrics bottle baskets, stainless steel round baskets, sterile cytological brushes, latex pacifiers, mom strips, cell chamber covers, glass funnel, amber bottles special, canning lid, bottle with lid, frosted glass bottles, germane laboratory bottles, cytological unit spray, syringe swab tube, rack with pipe plastic, needle syringe, key step with Teflon, surgical tubes, indicator paper, glass duck female and male urinary, white blood cells pipette, sterile latex etc. CUSTOMERS The company's target market is the approximately 2,543 public and private hospitals, and approximately 110,000 physicians throughout the region according to United Nations Program of Development. 40.3% of all the population, including hospitals and any type of care centers are located in the Metropolitan area of Santiago where our company is located. Our other markets include pharmacies, home based care centers and municipalities. Due to the isolated location of Chile there is a shortage of importers from around the world especially with the increasing demand for sophisticated diagnostic equipment and supplies. At this time we had preliminary talks with potential clients: Hospital Claudio Vicuna, Dr. Juan Villagran Garcia, Municipality of Puerto Montt, EquiLab LTDA, and Santa Maria Clinic. All of them have specified to us the products that they require on regular basis and we are going to include them in every one of our orders. These clients have expressed interest in our product and verbally agreed to give us the preference when ordering. However we did not execute any agreement with these clients and they do not have any obligation to purchase our product. 15 MARKETING Initially, our main way of promoting our services will be by soliciting prospective clients directly and describing our list of products and services. Another way will be by arranging a meeting directly with the potential customer thru referrals. Once we have ordered our initial inventory of products based on the "wish list" from our potential clients and more, we will be checking the following website www.mercadopublico.cl to see the products requirements by future potential clients. The website lists all the clinics and hospitals which are looking for specific equipment and supplies; they put up their requests daily and the lists remain online for the duration of 10-30 days being updated everyday. Once we will have the product that is being listed, we then contact the customer to negotiate the price, time frame, payment and delivery. Once we will complete the order, we will try to arrange for future orders. Another main communications channel will be the digital media via Internet. We plan to promote our products at our website www.pnmedgroup.com. Our website will list the benefits of using our products. We will print business cards and have our website listed on it. The client will also be able to submit order requests, view current orders online and/or contact us via email linked to our website or call our company directly. Furthermore, we plan to attend different fairs and trade shows to further promote our business, hand out business cards, meet potential clients and referrals. At last, the best marketing of our business will be our low prices. We will focus on sourcing our product from suppliers with high quality product and competitive pricing. Involving no commission base agents we will take the product straight from the factory to the buyer, keeping the prices low. CUSTOMER SERVICE We intend to follow-up on our previous orders to make sure everything worked out well and our clients don't have any problems or concerns. We will offer same- day delivery on a regular basis with no minimum order size and no shipping charges. Customer order received by or before 10:30 am will be delivered same day within a 100 miles radius. Within 30 miles radius, the order will be delivered the same day if received by noon. At first, Mr. Niklitschek or the secretary will use Pedro Niklitschek's car (2007 Suzuki) to deliver products. Mr. Niklitschek will bill us $.25 per each km driven. When our operations expand by March 2013 we plan on purchasing 2007-2009 Peugeot Partner (cost $12,000). Returns of unused, saleable products will be accepted for an instant credit and left in our inventory for resale to another client. AGREEMENT We have signed an agreement, dated February 25, 2012 with Kangtai Medical Devices Co. who is located in China. The following are some of the terms of the agreement: a) Kangtai Medical Devices Co. offers us free shipping, discount prices and a fast processing time. b) PNMG have agreed to make an order from Kangtai Medical Devices Co. at least once every 3 months and diligently promote their products. c) Kangtai Medical Devices Co will act as our exclusive distributor of manufacturer's medical devices throughout the territory of Chile. d) Manufacturer agrees to furnish Distributor with reasonable quantities of Manufacturer's catalogs, manuals, advertising literature and other sales aids that may be available by Manufacturer. 16 With the expansion of the company we intend to find more variety of suppliers and factories in other countries such as India, Philippines, Turkey, Poland, and Kazakhstan. PRICES AND PAYING Chile has a free-trade agreement with China, so we will not need to pay any duties on our products coming from there. It will take approximately 2-3 months to receive our order. Our prices on products will have an additional Chilean government obligatory 19% tax. Payments shall be made to one of our accounts without any deductions. Payments by Customer shall be due upon receipt of the invoice. Customer agrees to make payment within 14 days. Upon the expiry of this deadline, Customers shall be in default of payment. COMPETITION Our competition will include other distribution companies, importers, and agents with the same or similar product list. However, the medical field grows rapidly and there is a constant need for new and more sophisticated equipment as well as more supplies. We expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. Competitors include companies with a more substantial customer bases. There can be no assurance that we can maintain a competitive position against current or future competitors, particularly those with greater financial, marketing, service, and support, technical and other resources. Our failure to maintain a competitive position within the market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. INSURANCE We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us, which could cause us to cease operations. EMPLOYEES; IDENTIFICATION OF CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEES.

Please refer to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and the applicable statutes of the State of Nevada for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of the Company's securities. ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW Nevada revised statutes sections 78.378 to 78.3793 provide state regulation over the acquisition of a controlling interest in certain Nevada corporations unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation provide that the provisions of these sections do not apply. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws do not state that these provisions do not apply. The statute creates a number of restrictions on the ability of a person or entity to acquire control of a Nevada company by setting down certain rules of conduct and voting restrictions in any acquisition attempt, among other things. The statute is limited to corporations that are organized in the state of Nevada and that have 200 or more stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents of the state of Nevada; and does business in the state of Nevada directly or through an affiliated corporation. Because of these conditions, the statute does not apply to our company. DIVIDEND POLICY We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION REGARDING INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES Our Articles of Incorporation provide that we will indemnify an officer, director, or former officer or director, to the full extent permitted by law. We have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by one of our director, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our legal counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit the question of whether such indemnification is against public policy to a court of appropriate jurisdiction. We will then be governed by the court's decision. 22 LEGAL MATTERS An opinion regarding the validity of the issuance of the shares of our common stock offered hereby will be provided by Stepp Law Corporation.

Santiago, Chile We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of PN Med Group Inc. (the "Company") as of March 31, 2012, and the related statements of operations, stockholder's equity, and cash flows for the period from January 30, 2012 (Date of Inception) through March 31, 2012. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PN Med Group Inc. as of March 31, 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from January 30, 2012 (Date of Inception) through March 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements, the Company has limited working capital, has not yet received revenue from sales of products or services, and has incurred losses from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans with regard to these matters are described in Note 8. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ Silberstein Ungar, PLLC ---------------------------------- Bingham Farms, Michigan April 27, 2012 F-1 PN MED GROUP INC.

F-5 PN MED GROUP INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2012 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS PN Med Group Inc. (the "Company" or "PN Med") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 30, 2012. The Company plans to distribute medical supplies and equipment to municipalities, hospitals, pharmacies, care centers, and clinics throughout the country of Chile. NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Development Stage Company The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles related to development stage companies. A development-stage company is one in which planned principal operations have not commenced or if its operations have commenced, there has been no significant revenues there from. Basis of Presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. Accounting Basis The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP" accounting). The Company has adopted a March 31 fiscal year end. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had $8,443 of cash as of March 31, 2012. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accrued expenses and amounts due to a shareholder. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements. Income Taxes Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured. F-6 PN MED GROUP INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2012 NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. Basic Income (Loss) Per Share Basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no such common stock equivalents outstanding as of March 31, 2012. Comprehensive Income The Company has which established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. When applicable, the Company would disclose this information on its Statement of Stockholders' Equity. Comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company has not had any significant transactions that are required to be reported in other comprehensive income. Recent Accounting Pronouncements PN Med does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flow. NOTE 3 - ACCRUED EXPENSES Accrued expenses at March 31, 2012 consisted of amounts owed to the Company's outside independent auditors for services rendered for period reported on in these financial statements. NOTE 4 - LOAN FROM SHAREHOLDER A shareholder and officer loaned $3,600 to the Company to open the bank account and help fund operations. The loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. The balance due to the shareholder and officer was $3,600 as of March 31, 2012. NOTE 5 - CAPITAL STOCK The Company has 75,000,000, $0.001 par value shares of common stock authorized. On March 29, 2012, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $5,000 at $0.001 per share. There were 5,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2012. NOTE 6 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property. An officer has provided office services without charge. There is no obligation for the officer to continue this arrangement. Such costs are immaterial to the financial statements and accordingly are not reflected herein. The officers and directors are involved in other business activities and most likely will become involved in other business activities in the future. F-7 PN MED GROUP INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2012 NOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES As of March 31, 2012, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $4,600 that may be available to reduce future years' taxable income in varying amounts through 2032. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards. The provision for Federal income tax consists of the following: 2012 -------- Federal income tax benefit attributable to: Current Operations $ 1,583 Less: valuation allowance (1,583) -------- Net provision for Federal income taxes $ 0 ======== The cumulative tax effect at the expected rate of 34% of significant items comprising our net deferred tax amount is as follows: 2012 -------- Deferred tax asset attributable to: Net operating loss carryover $ 1,583 Less: valuation allowance (1,583) -------- Net deferred tax asset $ 0 ======== Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $4,600 for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years. NOTE 8 - GOING CONCERN The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company had no revenues as of March 31, 2012. The Company currently has limited working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management's efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern. NOTE 9 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to March 31, 2012 to the date these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.
